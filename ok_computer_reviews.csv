finulanu,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I get why Radiohead rub a lot of people the wrong way. A lot of people just find them too cold, and Thom Yorke has one of those voices that\'ll drive a lot of people batty. They\'re also such an enormously acclaimed band that a little backlash was just inevitable. Plus, even I find their image as the self-ordained Darkest Weirdest Band On Earth a little excessive, and I gave this album five stars! Oh, and did I mentioned how widely imitated they are? We live in a world where bands like Coldplay and Muse and Keane diluted this sound into something a little more radio-friendly and made buckets of money off it. In cases like that, you couldn\'t be blamed if you wonder: does the original stand up after all?\n\nWell, I\'ve got some nitpicks of my own. ""Electioneering"" isn\'t quite the headbanger\'s extravaganza it clearly wants to be (great guitars at the end, though), while ""Fitter Happier"" still sounds a little too edgy-\'90s for my liking (isn\'t there a Nine Inch Nails b-side called ""A Pig In a Cage On Antibiotics?""). If I ever bust this score down to a 4.5, it\'s probably because they put these two right in a row. My opinion on ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" depends on my mood; sometimes I get caught up in the gothic drama of the whole thing, and other times, it just seems like a whole lot of overheated nothing. In other words, I\'m not quite ready to go out and say OK Computer is a perfect album. I would\'ve said that at one point, a less mature point in my life indeed, but you know how it is. You get older, and that album you loved so much shows a few of its rough edges.\n\nYet the best songs on this album really are as good as you\'ve heard. Pretty much all of them. I\'d hesitate to call ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" a masterpiece, but its subtly tricky arrangement and much-needed humor make it an important addition to the album. You\'ve just got to lighten things up sometimes, because this record gets heavy. Sometimes in terms of the guitars (they tear some shit up in the loud parts of ""Paranoid Android""), but more in terms of the emotions. This album is one negative trip, my friends. ""Android"" lurches between queasy acoustic guitars, wall-rattling riffs, and goth-prog creepiness, in brilliant fashion - think how ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" constantly keeps you off your kilter, but the release is much different. ""Climbing Up the Walls"" plunges you deep into some horror-movie shit, with huge drums, processed vocals (Yorke lets some bloodcurdling screams loose), and some of Greenwood\'s earliest string arrangements. Even ""No Surprises,"" which musically is almost McCartney-esque in its mellow lull, has some dark fucking lyrics. Radiohead plunges you into a dark and alienating world with this album, is what I\'m saying here.\n\nNormally this kind of relentless grimness puts me off (pretty sure I\'ve raised this complaint about Pink Floyd), but Radiohead knows their way around a song. The tunes I mentioned above are spectacularly well-crafted. ""Android\'s"" multipart structure is no mere grab bag - each part not only flows with but builds onto the one before it. ""Climbing Up the Walls"" earns its explosive ending - the fireworks is always just waiting there, so when they finally hit, they feel like the most natural development. ""No Surprises"" is plenty lovely, but with an ominous edge. And hey, there\'s more where that came from. Take my personal favorite, ""Let Down."" This one\'s best known for its third verse, where Thom Yorke duets with himself. It\'s a soaring and spectacular moment, the album at its most emotional and yearning, and it gets there by way of a tense but lovely keyboard solo. Even before all that kicks in, check out the blend of icy guitars and Ringo-style drums that move the verses and choruses. There is, in short, a real attention to sonic detail here. The detail\'s why I never minded the Beatles lift on ""Karma Police."" Not only does the piano part fit in with the song\'s soft chorus beautifully, but the textures in the coda are pure Radiohead.\n\nThose five are the biggies for most people, but the cool thing about this album is there\'s a lot going on here. Somehow I\'ve made it alll this way without even mentioning the opener, ""Airbag."" Shame on me! What a great song. The atmospheric guitar, sprinkles of keyboards, and cello hook might not surprise you, but the song is also kinda funky. Great beat here, and a great bassline, too. Radiohead\'s rhythm section doesn\'t get a lot of attention, but they deserve a lot of credit for shaping their sound. They don\'t get as much attention on the closer, the waltzing ""Tourist,"" but that\'s also a feast of sound. Check out the dreamy country guitars, the mellotron choir, even the little ding of a triangle at the end. While we\'re in the album\'s closing stretch, I\'ve always really enjoyed ""Lucky."" Yorke\'s soaring vocal and Greenwood\'s most balls-out bombastic guitar make a great pair on this one.\n\nI guess my only question is what to do about those two weaker tracks. They had some great material in the vaults - the trip-hoppy instrumental ""Meeting in the Aisle"" would\'ve made a much better transition than ""Fitter Happier,"" and ""Pearly"" rocks much better than ""Electioneering."" I also wish ""Polyethylene"" had found a home on an album - to my ears, it\'s one of Radiohead\'s better tracks, with a big tonal shift I\'ve always really loved. Still, we got the album we got. Not one of those albums where every song is a total gem, but an album whose high points are so dazzling I can\'t help but go the full five.']",5.00 stars
FlintGF,"['I\'d like to think I\'m good about not letting the wider critical world affect my own amateur reviews. Rather than saying this or that is overrated or underrated, or making parallels about my opinions vs everyone else\'s, I prefer looking at things within my own bubble - after all, it\'s my opinion that matters the most to my listening habits and I imagine someone would read my thoughts to learn what I personally think. With some records that\'s harder than others. There\'s a number of albums that are so universal that they form a part of our collective consciousness even if we don\'t care about them: albums which have been discussed and analysed so often and in such great detail due to their importance and place in the canon that there is literally nothing new to say. Most of the time, I can still comfortably get by. Enough time has passed from The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and other sacred cows that the old canon narratives are actively being argued against while new ones are established and there\'s a wider variety of opinions challenging the old classics, and somewhere between those lines I\'m able to place my own opinion without feeling like I\'m better off just linking to the relevant Wikipedia section. Not to mention that for most iconic records, I\'m too much of a natural contrarian to hold them in the highest of pedestals in the first place.\n\nOK Computer is a curveball for me in this regard. It\'s a landmark album, and even I agree with that - to a degree that it feels like an actual challenge to start dissecting it apart. You\'re not going to find unique angles to view this album through from me, is what I am saying. It\'s my generation\'s Sgt Peppers, and I\'m saying that without a single ounce of hyperbole. It\'s a cultural milestone that has affected so much of the other music I enjoy, inspired countless other musicians and shifted genre trends. To this day it causes so much discussion, analysis and over-analysis that we are all absolutely sick of it. We can all recite from memory the story of Thom Yorke & co becoming increasingly fatigued by society and music industry at the same time as they felt their ambitions limited by their early sound, and in turn exploding in fame and finding themselves even more fatigued through the record they made to channel all of that frustration and ambition through. And if you don\'t, you\'re pretending - because OK Computer transcends any genre barrier knowledge if you\'re even remotely passionate about music. It\'s omnipresent.You can\'t avoid it, no matter how much you want.\n\nEven now, OK Computer is a prime example of a band reaching for their lofty ambitions and realising the breadth of their own skill set, and taking a boundary-breaking leap within their own path. Comparing Pablo Honey and The Bends to it is practically pointless because the change is so vast: there\'s enough hints on both albums, particularly The Bends, to point out where OK Computer came from but the narrative is loose, the familiarities superficial at best. OK Computer effectively re-introduces Radiohead from scratch: the urban angst of grunge-era guitar walls has evolved into pre-millennial apathy and depression, and the band are musically thinking outside their own box to the point that the tropes introduced here are now aspects the band are forever associated with. Not just that, but they\'re also elements that are echoed within the particular kind of rock music that followed in OK Computer\'s wake. You can trace a direct genealogy from it to nearly everything that has been happening in indie and alternative rock since. You think of angst-laden, introspective guitars and you\'ll be able to trace them here.\n\nLike all the very best progenitors, OK Computer still sounds like its own thing even now. Despite how many times its tricks have been repeated, there\'s nothing that combines them quite like here. Part of it is due to Radiohead\'s own uniqueness, the very specific traits its members have: Yorke\'s falsetto wailing (oft imitated, never bettered) and characteristic lyrical style most obviously, but also Jonny Greenwood\'s flourishes inspired by modern classical and Phil Selway\'s razor-sharp drumming. There\'s also the neurotic flair that OK Computer is powered by that has never really been captured by its followers in quite this way. Yorke was very obviously not having a good time, the band as a whole found inspiration through it and traces of it are all over the album, whether it\'s the resigned exhaustion of ""No Surprises"", the anger of ""Electioneering"" or the downright crippling paranoia of ""Climbing Up the Walls"". OK Computer frequently sounds like its suffocating within its own four walls creeping closer together, only to push them periodically away to reveal something hopeful for a fleeting moment.\n\nOK Computer isn\'t Radiohead\'s best album. I understand why ""Paranoid Android"" is iconic and as admirable as its multi-suite progression is, I\'ve never seen it as a particular discography highlight and its first part towers above the others to the point I wish it was the blueprint for the entire song, and ""Electioneering"" meanwhile is basically an attempt to re-do R.E.M.\'s ""Ignoreland"" but quite simply not as good. They\'re good but neither are songs I could say lifts the album for me. I also just think that Radiohead started to get really interesting after they decided to deconstruct and reassemble themselves in OK Computer\'s aftermath, which is when their skitterish neuroses found a sound that perfectly suited it. But, I understand why it\'s such a revered album, and it wouldn\'t need a great stretch to make me into a true believer too. After all, many of their best songs are here. ""Let Down"" is in some days is in fact the best song they ever wrote, period, making the world-weary desire to disappear into the most gorgeous thing when in its final minutes the song jumps off a cliff and soars into the sunset on the wings of its layered vocal parts and intensifying instrumental section. ""Karma Police"" is one of Radiohead\'s most haunting but bottles a quietly churning rage, and it twists that dagger deeper with each new section it offers. The finale for ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is like that bottled rage finally breaking through, igniting into a wall of distressed sound of the like the band\'s rarely tried since.\n\nThe final stretch of the album is also probably one of the all-time best closing runs: ""Climbing Up the Walls"" makes an orchestral section sound distressingly claustrophobic (it\'s phenomenal, by the way); the simple but endlessly beautiful ""No Surprises"" is the other big contender for the band\'s best song and in fact its quiet but powerful fragility is what converted me into thinking there\'s something to this band after all; ""Lucky"" is as atmospheric a rock anthem as the band would ever do and the second verse\'s introduction of the simple keyboard texture is one of my pet favourite moments of simple instrumental additions making a real difference; and ""The Tourist"" achingly floats in its own world, giving the paranoia of the album a calm breathe out in the end. OK Computer has throughout its length hit with some big punches and overall high quality miserablist rock, but it concludes like a real iconic moment in music history.\n\nFurthermore, OK Computer still feels just as relevant as it always was as well, maybe even moreso in this modern society that\'s growing more cynical and fatigued by the month. It\'s just as evocative and its songs are still impactful, proving their strengths despite every single one of them having been picked to their bones over the years; including the ""Fitter Happier"" interlude, which genuinely has its own important slot in the overall flow and Greater Thematics of the album. OK Computer is a truly great album, often stunningly so, and very audibly a moment where a band realised their own capabilities towards greatness and made them a reality. That so many people in the world agree with me, a lot of them way more passionately than I do, is a happy coincidence. This is all to say that out of all the albums in my collection, OK Computer is probably the one record I find the most difficult to discuss, but you\'re in luck: in a matter of seconds you can find thousands of reviews, articles and in-depth essays that say what I\'d likely think anyway. This must be what Beatles fans feel like.\n\nIt\'s not one of my personal all-time greats but its place among the canon is more than justified.']",4.50 stars
seagull59,"[""There are Radiohead devotees like there were once Bowie devotees. Those who find the unexpected change in direction exciting rather than disconcerting. Those who discover a little more meaning in it all than the rest of us think necessary to enquire into. It's an admirable tradition that goes back at least as far as the Beatles. OK Computer draws a little from the Beatles, as from Pink Floyd and even U2. The 60's, 70's and 80's...man, if you could put those big names into a successful mix, then you're on to a winner! OK Computer does just that, with a sound production that does justice to its prestigious forerunners.\nQuintessential art-rock, song based but sufficiently removed from any stifling Grunge influence and liberated by a laissez-faire, neo-progressive experimentalism, it's no wonder that this is their most celebrated release - it reaches back to earlier generations rather than alienating them.\nThere's no denying that Radiohead's instincts for grand theatrics - combining biting self-analysis and semi-bombastic instrumental innovation - are artistically convincing and Yorke's vocal style probably summed up a generation of angst-ridden youngsters. What's more, the music can scale some frightening heights, carefully crafted to be sure, yet with a natural band feel. But under closer scrutiny some of the patching up can be a little irritating. Where songs aren't arranged to segue seamlessly, they often resort to silly effects driven bridges. And not every song stands up, some are given artificial support that isn't always successfully integrated - pulling out all the stops begins to sound like damage limitation. On Climbing Up The Walls it seems to work splendidly, Airbag too, goes full tilt with breath-taking confidence, but a song like Lucky seems too slight to be dressed up that way, likewise Let Down and Electioneering. Fortunately Subterranean Homesick Blues and Paranoid Android more than make up.\nBut if the album is only slightly over-ambitious, that's not a crime and, to be fair, all the songs hang together and add up to one seminal rock album...perhaps one of the last in this age of downloading and playlisting.\nBut I do miss something to make me smile - rather than just nod - and it's odd perhaps, that something so downbeat could have made such an impression....much like Floyd in the 70's I suppose, taking themselves so depressingly seriously. And I miss a strong back-beat or a funky jazz for all its dazzle and guile.\nAs always, it comes down to personal tastes. This album means an awful lot to a great many people. It's easy to see why.""]",4.00 stars
Zephos,"['I wrote a shining excellent review for this album, and then the browser went nuts, froze, and somehow logged me out and the review was destroyed. I\'m still pissed the fuck off just having to redo it all (you know how much crap I write). But in spite of this it\'s almost horribly fitting. Because that\'s what OK Computer is kind of ""about"". And what is that? Well first what do you think might be the leading reason for a sort of revitalization in rock music with this year? Because it\'s undeniably the most ALIVE year in the genre since basically 1991, easily. Not that anything was wrong with the 90\'s, I hear tell electronic music from this time was strong. And 91-96? The golden age of Hip-Hop right there, some of the finest material ever dropped. But for rock? Kind of a dry time, not BAD or anything, just....dry. Stagnate. Heck the last time Rock was this dry was ages ago, the mid-70\'s, and that was much briefer, AND 1975 kicked ass anyway. So this is easily the biggest drought in the genre\'s history so far. Sure part of the reason may have been how many awesome bands died or fell off prematurely right before it (MBV, Jane\'s Addiction, Slint, Guns N Roses, Stone Roses, Pixies). But mostly it felt strapped for direction and ideas, only Post-Rock truly excited, and even that only really starts taking off with 97\' anyway. 97\' solved the identity crisis, because Rock finally realized what was going on in the world around it and how to start putting that into music. Around 97\' if you\'re old enough to recall was when the digital age really started to happened, when information economy swung in for real, a new technological and social world began. Lots of bands started processing that, and the rewards were plenty. And no one better synthesized it into a sound than Radiohead did with OK Computer. Except this isn\'t the good sides of all that, not the super sleek and clean aesthetics that graced much of the late 90\'s art world. Radiohead became obsessed with the dark sides, the strange furious frustrations not with humans like the Hippies and Punks before them, but with the claustrophobia and plastic of the inanimate around us. This is in the lyrics, and VERY much in the songs. The music here is wonderful stuff, a complete realization not only of everything they\'d been playing at since the start but of every single new thing they tried out too. Their old obsession with slow burning songs on Bends didn\'t all the way convince me in it\'s execution. In fact one of the main things that made me weary of them from far off was all their slow songs, The Bends didn\'t make me unscared either. But here that side of them is made real, doubtlessly great and worth it\'s time. The more anthemic and energetic songs are astounding works here. With all the simple Britpop anthems running around at the time (including virtually the whole of Be Here Now) it\'s easy to forget what a truly exciting and forward thinking rock anthem would sound like. You know, one that isn\'t overly indebted to some past form of music. And in comes songs like Airbag, Karma Police, and Climbing Up the Walls, sounding like nothing else before them...and sweeping you away in their sad grandeur. The mood of the album is worth noting too. It\'s at turns hopeful and despairing, sometimes seemingly at the same time. It\'s an odd sort of melancholy that seems almost disengaged in it\'s own fate. The melodies are beautifully sad, like The Smiths before them, but Yorke sees no strut in his breed of misery like Morrissey did. Instead it\'s almost resigned and passive about crumbling world, very Millennial in a way. That music video of Thom Yorke calmly singing in a tube as water fills up around him is pretty damn apt I\'d say wouldn\'t you? And due to all this OK Computer is perhaps still the one record modern rock lives in the shadow of. Not Nevermind. Nevermind cast it\'s shadow deep into the 00\'s, but mostly on irrelevant crap, it\'s real legacy sadly being ""Teenage angst has paid off well"" rather than any meaningful cultural imprint (aside from killing off much of the old mainstream anyway). Instead it\'s OK Computer that has informed subsequent rock, mostly the Brits with bands like Muse and Coldplay, but also North Americans like Interpol and Arcade Fire. This is 2000\'s music being born here, far more important than people give it credit for, and people give it a ton of credit as is.\n\nRating: 5\nHighlights: Airbag, Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Climbing Up the Walls']",5.00 stars
Communique,"['Hurrah, finally I had my first Radiohead experience after all these years! OK Computer on a burned CD! Hurrah! I had to wait so long.\n\nIn earnest: How can anybody really enjoy a record like this? These ever meandering \'songs\', that sometimes start auspicious or have some decent middle part, before or after mostly presenting some nerve-wrecking noise? This whining \'singer\', whose voice is even more bugging than Bono\'s?\n\nWhere do these lads have their \'ideas\' from? Is it U2\'s misled Achtung Baby? Is it some unknown, troubled, psychedelic trip jazz prog combo from Finland or so? I don\'t know, and to be honest, it doesn\'t interest me at all.\n\nMaybe in the end Radiohead are some paranoid androids? Ha! Ha! Ha!\n\nPS: There is one track, that somehow appeals to me throughout its very length. It\'s called ""Lucky"". And another one almost manages the same achievement. It\'s called ""Exit Music (For a Film)"". Nevertheless even these songs probably wouldn\'t make it on one of my mix CD\'s for the car stereo.']",2.50 stars

Roy_Pearl,"['So let me get this straight. A bunch of one-hit-wonder grunge copyists (""Pablo Honey"") bottom out after flitting over to overly-precious Britpop (""The Bends""), and then decide that song structure is what\'s holding them back. The melodies and words on OK Computer sound like Thom Yorke is making them up as he sings them. The thematic conceit is retarded. The music - while not wholly unlikeable - trades bombast for pretension. And some people find this challenging and out-there? It\'s avant-garde for people who\'ve never heard anything avant-garde - much closer to the meandering, tuneless, self-important prog bullshit that made punk rock necessary.\n\nUnfortunately - though predictably - this psuedo-intellectual, gussied-up Britpop approach to experimentalism proved safe enough that _OK Computer_ tapped into the zeitgeist. In other words, it\'s just _out there_ enough to give a conservative mainstream audience a fleeting sense of being hip. Now, get back in your cages.']",2.50 stars

The execution is really pretty good, and if you\'re buying what they\'re selling I can see the attraction, I am not, however, buying.\nI hadn\'t intended ever owning this as every Radiohead song I\'d heard has left me cold, but after a lengthy discussion with a friend who couldn\'t understand how anyone couldn\'t like this he gave me a copy assuring me that I would come around. I tried, I really did, but I just can\'t enjoy this at all. The biggest sticking point is probably the annoyingly whiny ""I\'m just so fucking profound"" vocals, but not far behind is all the cliché studio gimmickry, the weak songwriting, and uninteresting arrangements. The band does play well from a technical standpoint, but that stopped being enough for me when I was about 14.']",2.00 stars
greenback,"['I can see a few progressive rock elements in this record: at least, it surely has a very elaborated psychedelic & alternative rock style. The grunge electric guitars may remind you the King Crimson of the mid 70\'s. The psychedelic dimension may remind you Pink Floyd and Porcupine Tree. There are 2 elements that I really do not like: 1) The electric guitars arrangements that have a gross garage sound. 2) Yorke\'s plaintive and irritating voice that expresses all the pain & misery one can feel during his early life. The melody and harmony are not too much present on most of the tracks! Thom Yorke sings a bit like Bono of U2. Is the way he sings a manifestation of all the pain he has lived?\n\nThe tracks are serious and depressing: maybe this record allows the deletion of internal uneases: this record does not have this effect on me. The main problem is the lack of catchiness and addiction. Plus, one has to admit that the tracks sound pretty marginal. The worst moments are definitely tracks like ""Fitter Happier"" and ""Electioneering"". ""Electioneering"" is a real teeth grinding track.\n\nThere are some decent moments: ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" has not bad keyboards arrangements & echoed ambience. The good futuristic end of ""Let Down"" is unfortunately too short. The more melodic track ""No surprise"" actually has a surprise: some good percussions, which may make you forget the annoying rhythmic guitar! ""The Tourist"" and ""Let Down"" have catchier refrains.\n\nIf I compare to the usual alternative rock bands, then OK Computer is more interesting and sophisticated. On the other hand, I do not feel the need to keep this record in my collection. 2 stars seems appropriate.\n\nPlease, live and let live: do not tell people what to like or to not like: there is a reason that explains why people like Radiohead, and the important is that it is good for them.']",2.00 stars

Vito_James,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'There are certain classics that will, no matter what, be known as an epitome of classical standard for all the future of that particular art. For example, all movie fans will forever idolize The Godfather. All literature-obsessed bodies will continue to glorify Shakespeare. All fans of cartoons will find solace in The Flintstones and Scooby-Doo. There\'s something wonderful about music though, and it\'s that there isn\'t just one kind of music. I know, there also isn\'t just one kind of movie, but...a movie is a movie. It\'s the same experience no matter what it may be about. You sit down, you watch something, it means something, the end. Music isn\'t quite like that. Sure, we sit down, we listen to something, it means something, the end. But...music also manages to utilize tens upon hundreds of elements in one song, where it then throws them into a giant melting pot for mixing, and then finally dump the contents onto the person who is experiencing the music (a.k.a., the listener). It is only fair to conclude that each and every song is felt and experienced differently by each and every individual.\n\nTo be fair to the movies and books and cartoons of the world (all of which I hold dear to my heart as well), I know that each of the aforementioned things applies to all forms of art. It seems though that, with music, we are given a much more vague and self-reliant hold on exactly how to enjoy it. When you sit down and watch a TV show, all you need is a little bit of attention, your eyes to the screen, and a comfy place to sit. If you have all of these, the only thing that can keep you from enjoying said program is an intellectual difference. With music, it requires much more work on the listener\'s part; you need to focus on the sounds, listen to the words, form the atmosphere that the song will carry, and remain in an alert and sound environment (at least when you\'re still getting used to a particular piece of music). This is one of the reasons that I turn to music to quench my artistic thirsts.\n\nRadiohead in particular does not help the average listener. Quite the contrary, actually; when I first heard OK Computer, I was compelled to turn it off because I was so out of my element upon hearing it for the first time. That was years ago now, and I\'m glad that I continued to give this band (and more importantly, this album) chances. What starts out as a very attention-needing listening session, OK Computer manages to lay all of its cards out on the table in a very easy fashion, once you\'ve gotten to know it. It\'s almost like the really interesting cool kid who doesn\'t trust anybody: almost everybody knows who they are, and many people who have become friends with that person find them to be incredible, but...at the same time, it\'s a really difficult task to get yourself that high in this person\'s graces. OK Computer flat out rejected me and my tastes the first time I heard it, and I was so discouraged that I didn\'t go back for well over a year. I just took it that Radiohead wasn\'t for me. I later couldn\'t handle all of the hype for this band, and decided that I would jam this thing into my head no matter what. Some say that forcing something on yourself is a bad thing, but I learned that statement to be a false one.\n\nAs I\'ll say with many of the albums featured in my favorites list, I like to listen to my albums as a whole. This does happen to be one of those records where I don\'t like to single out songs, but...that\'s the wonderful thing about this album: I can. I can actually listen to this as a whole, but then go on to pick out and listen to individual songs that are of particularly noteworthy quality. Some say that this would throw off the album consistency, but I don\'t find that true for OK Computer. Radiohead paints a wonderful picture on almost every track that this album has to offer (I say almost due to two filler tracks: ""Airbag"" (which everyone loves and I find to be a whiny mess), and ""Fitter Happier"" (a crappy (and creepy) interlude of sorts). Analyzing just a few of these key songs, I\'d like to point your attentions to what many (myself included) consider Radiohead\'s very own ""Stairway to Heaven"": ""Paranoid Android"". This was the first Radiohead song I ever heard, and I didn\'t care for it the first time I heard it. I decided I\'d let it grow on me though, and I am satisfied with this song. Yeah, it\'s a great song, even if there are a few better songs from this album anyway. ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" earned its high graces from me when I decided to play it on repeat one night for 65 times. I slept through most of those sixty-five listens, but the theme is forever embedded into my conscious and subconscious mind. ""Let Down"" earns itself as the most beautiful song of the album, and ""Karma Police"" gets the award for the catchiest. Still, one song will always reign over the others for me, and that song is ""Climbing Up the Walls"". This is a contender for my favorite Radiohead song ever, packing in some of the strongest emotional themes that has ever been touched in alternative rock: fear, insanity, and the unknown.\n\nWhile these aren\'t the only songs noteworthy of mentioning from OK Computer, I feel that I\'d only be bringing down the review and wasting your times mentioning more, such as ""Electioneering""\'s Muse-esque qualities or ""Exit Music (For a Film)""\'s wonderful sentiments (okay, I slipped up a bit there).\n\nRadiohead would not go on to do another rock-based album in a long time after this one; even this album wasn\'t all rock-based. The Bends serves as the final truly rock album by Radiohead, and I really wish they had balanced their future works out as well as they did here. Maybe that\'s why this is considered by many to be Radiohead\'s Blackwater Park. Who knows? All I know is that each song manages to speak for itself. This is a quality that I find many bands struggle with; Mr. Yorke demonstrates the proper way to do such things.\n\nJust how this album managed to evolve my tastes is something that I can barely begin to describe. If I started, I\'d probably break some sort of hidden character limit that RYM has for reviews. With all that I\'ve said, I\'d like to close my thoughts gently with a lovely line from frenchie\'s review:\n\n""As you can see it is nearly impossible to actually describe and review the music contained on this record. It\'s just EVERYTHING. The meaning of life may well be hidden in there somewhere.""\n\nThis album is simply one of the greatest and easiest listening experiences for any person who has the patience and will to achieve such zen. I encourage everybody to not give up when they hear this...it\'s far too amazing to give up on. There are certain classics that will, no matter what, be known as an epitome of classical standard for all the future of that particular art, and OK Computer has went down as that very standard that all experimental and alternative rock follows.\n\nHave a lovely day, everybody.']",4.50 stars
HorseMouth,"['For whatever reason earlier on I was sat about reading this album\'s Wikipedia page and I thought \'you know, I really need to listen to this. This is essential music. There are Radiohead albums out there you\'ve never heard and instead you\'re listening to Aryan Kampf 88!\'\n\nWikipedia sure makes a big fuss about some guys who made a record. Makes the songwriting process sound like some sort of world-changing historical event. The amount of praise vomited upon this album had me prepared to believe the hype. As I put my headphones on I looked around the room and was half-thinking that when this thing was over, my life would not be the same again.\n\nAfter my head was cleared of bombastic thoughts I pushed play and submitted to 53 minutes of Radiohead. And lo, it sounded... alright.\n\nThis is nowhere near as epic as I thought it would be. I mean, ""Airbag"" is a pretty damn epic way to open an album. But the majority of the remaining tracks just seem a little too pedestrian for my liking when I was expecting something experimental. Here\'s the part where I get contrarian: most of this is just pop/rock.\n\nDo you hear me? I said MOST OF THIS IS POP/ROCK!!! And I\'m not trying to be an arsehole. ""Let Down"" kinda reminded me of that song by Take That about riding on a star and ruling the world, just a little bit more fancy with some electro-bleeps here and there.\n\nI just think that above all Thom Yorke\'s mumbling style isn\'t really too my liking; I don\'t find he has enough presence. Songs like ""Exit Music"" passed by unnoticed. ""Electioneering"" was a much-needed harder track but is let down by a completely anticlimactic chorus.\n\nI won\'t deny that the whole thing has a good atmosphere, particularly ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" and ""Paranoid Android"", especially the \'god loves his children\' part. ""No Surprises"" is probably the highlight in terms of guitar playing.\n\nCall me a bullshitter, but while most people say that ""Fitter Happier"" is the album\'s weakest moment, I thought it was one of the strongest tracks. It\'s just so eerie, this cold, mechanical text-to-speech voice recycling cliches of the advertising industry over sparse electronica. It seems a more interesting indictment of consumer culture than what we get in the other songs. If Thom Yorke devised this piece when he had writer\'s block, maybe writer\'s block gives him better ideas.\n\nDo you want to hear a great album?

JorgeBizarro,"['En octubre de 1997 compré mi copia de OK Computer. No había sido uno de esos discos que a esa edad quería con muchas ansias (como sí lo fué el Mellon Collie, por nombrar uno que no me dé tanta vergüenza), pero sí que se ganó un lugar especial en mi colección; además, fue de esos CD\'s que era edición británica y que vendían en las discotiendas, antes de que la distribuidora nacional, en este caso EMI Colombia, lanzara su propia edición, por lo tanto el libro que traía estaba como tenía que ser (de hecho, protegí el borde con cinta transparente), no uno de esos acordeones de papel más delgado. El track 7 estaba sin remedio rayado para la grabadora Aiwa que había comprado un año atrás, y es que era obvio en aquel entonces que no tenía nada de interesante ""Fitter Happier"", por lo que la saltaba todos los días seguidos que me la pasaba sintonizado a OK Computer. Muchas veces, cuando recién estaba conociendo a Radiohead, decía que lo bueno aquí era casi todo, pero lo que valía la pena era ""Paranoid Android"" y un poco ""Karma Police"" o hasta ""Exit Music (For a Film)"". Compré el CD porque muchas revistas lo mencionaban como uno de los grandes acontecimientos del año, y rotaban el video aquel de esos dos personajes animados con unas aventuras en sitios que hoy ya no me parecen tan descabellados. De hecho, no había visto nunca a Thom Yorke, por lo que cuando oí estas canciones, lo imaginé muy distinto. Las imágenes que me producía este disco eran de un futuro no tan alejado, brillante pero monotono; a diferencia de hoy, que oyéndolo percibo ese presente de 1997 despojándose de los últimos rastros de romanticismo que le quedaban a la humanidad.\n\nTodo esto porque ¿qué cosa nueva se puede decir de OK Computer que no salga sobrando? Es un disco excelente que hoy no pierde vigencia, y de los pocos que luego de la década de los setentas, mostraron que musicalmente había aún cosas que hacer. Entre esos viajes en el tiempo que el arte te permite hacer, ahora puedo decir que sin duda este disco se le puede poner al lado de las reconocidas obras maestras de los padres del rock.\n\nQuizá pueda agregar ciertos ""pero\'s"" nuevos:\n- ""Electioneering"" te recuerda las canciones más poderosas del The Bends, pero no les alcanza a hacer ni media sombra.\n- ""Airbag"" es una buena canción, y seguro de las más alegres en una melancólica discografía, pero viendo el resto del repertorio una mejor canción podría abrir el álbum. Eso sí, cumple con la labor de introducirte desde un principio en la ironía de ese absurdo mundo desolado en el que rebotan afilados riffs y todo se desborona entre bits y lágrimas.\n- ""The Tourist"" tiene una hermosa melodía casi acuática, que alcanza el nivel de éxtasis necesario para finalizar un disco así, pero, sí, dependiendo del estado de ánimo en que te encuentres, puede ser mágica o aburridora.\n- Hagamos de cuenta que ""Paranoid Android"" no es tanto una sola gran idea para canción, y más varias ideas sencillas muy bien ejecutadas para referirse a un concepto amplio. Si algo pudiera no tener es cierto encanto, que provocase empatía general. De ahí que a muchos les caiga tan mal, porque no les llega. Eso sí, lo instrumental es bestial y el concepto en esos días funcionaba, mientras que hoy no tanto porque perdimos parte del miedo apocalíptico de los años noventa.\n- ""Climbing Up the Walls"" suena mucho a todas las demás bandas que resonaban por aquellos días (sí, Oasis).\n- Acabo de leer una comparación entre Radiohead y Muse mientras escuchaba el disco. El simple hecho de traer a colación que muchos aprendieron aquí como debía sonar el rock, y lo ejecutaron de la forma barata, es una confirmación de lo grande de esta banda, pero también es referente de actos musicales que deberían ser olvidados.\n\nSé que poco de lo que acabo de decir no es tan cierto, y que he tenido que rebuscar para querer sugerir alguna mejora. Y seguramente puedo aportar agregando lo que hoy he revalorado oyendo OK Computer:\nEstoy analizándolo canción por canción, y no intentándolo conceptualmente. O sea, la idea ya está más que asimilada, no hay nada que discutir. Lo que queda es redescubrir dentro de esos instantes nuevos que está generando la música en este momento. Hoy, OK Computer, tal y como unos pocos discos, es una obra que se debe asimilar así para poder encontrarle si acaso algún defecto o algo nuevo que no se haya dicho.\n\nCon todo esto, hoy sé que de toda la música que oía en 1997, OK Computer es la única que persiste en mi memoria no sólo como referente en cuanto a sonido, sino también en cuanto a calidad.']",5.00 stars
Shankus,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'This album changed rock and roll. It put the unmistakable, classic sound of \'60s-\'80s sock in a blender and mixed in the technological flavors and paranoia of the coming century. In this way, it can be seen as the bridge between classic and modern rock, a bridge that exists at a heightened level between each of its sides. More so than any other album, every song is a work of genius, and can be listened to for endless hours. From Airbag to the Tourist, the album flows seamlessly, instilling an atmosphere of passionate complexity as well as moments of intimate melancholy. This is not a ""sunny"" album - if anything, it is stormy. It forces you to listen, and you don\'t really even realize why your eyes are wet until the last ""ding"" of The Tourist. Any music lover who doesn\'t own this album is a fraud.']",5.00 stars
TheCunningStunt,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'It feels like everyone who loves Ok Computer has a story to tell. Some stories are more romanticised than others, but everyone who loves this album either seems to recall the first time they listened to it, the moment they fell in love with it, or the reasons why it has had such a profound and lasting effect on them and I\'m not too much different. To start with, the album basically changed my entire perception of what music was capable of. It made me truly understand what music was capable of in pretty much all aspects, but it was the first time I took into account track listings and sequencing and how an album with overall cohesion, themes, a vision and having something to say could really be something special. Of course, along with the \'best album ever\' tag hyperbolic praise gets bestowed upon it. This album and the band\'s music in general means a lot to people, and people make their feelings known. As well as hyperbolic praise, a backlash of hate from people who deem it to be ""overrated"". Even though it\'s generally considered to be a masterpiece, like with most things, people will hold an opinion to the contrary. But this is the kind of album that means so much to me on a personal level that I really don\'t care about any of the acclaim, adoration, backlash, hate or whatever else that comes along with it. Even though with an album as adored as this the people that don\'t see anything in it are in the minority, I just don\'t care about their opinion, I just let them have it. I obviously don\'t understand opinions that differ from mine, because I hear something different.\n\nI think the main factor in this being one of the best albums ever is because it\'s incredibly personal. It\'s thematically strong, these aren\'t just mere vapid or vacuous songs about nothing, they have an incredibly strong thematic centre and the subject matters of each song resonates with me. It\'s an existentialist album and one that feels incredibly personal. Ok Computer is about alienation, isolation, disassociation, loneliness, paranoia and a whole host of other things. But to start with, when I listened to it aged 15, I just loved the album. At first, unlike many other people\'s stories, the album didn\'t have a profound impact on my life. At least, not straight away. Before I\'d heard this, I originally listened to and owned The Bends and Pablo Honey and I loved them both - this was back when all I listened to was rock and guitar based music and nothing else. I\'m not sure why I decided to listen to those two albums before Ok Computer because I knew Ok Computer was the most famous Radiohead album and the album often cited as the band\'s crowning achievement, but I somehow did anyway. So after listening to the band\'s first two albums for a while, I decided to listen to Ok Computer. The first thing that really struck me about the album was just how much better it was than anything guitar based I\'d ever heard before. Before it meant something and really resonated with me on an emotional level, it just sounded so ridiculously good. It immediately made me dislike Pablo Honey. It just blew it out of the water in every single way. When I listened to Ok Computer I also was listening to a lot of Oasis, it blew them out the water. It basically blew everything guitar-based from the 90s away. I remember not knowing what the album was about or why it was so great, I just knew it was something pretty damn special. It didn\'t completely change my music taste when I listened to it 15 years of age, I still listened to an awful lot of crap before it and after it but this definitely shaped my music taste in the future. When I first listened to Ok Computer the lyrical content was too cryptic for me to even begin to understand. Then, we skip forward a few years. Every time I listen to this album now, all I hear is alienation, social anxiety and a real personal struggle brought on by technological advances and how they change the way people interact with others and the isolation it brings.\n\nSo, the album starts and \'Airbag\' comes on. With \'Airbag\' you have a strangely refreshing song - at least on the surface. A song about escaping death, a new lease of life, being born again and being saved. Though it may be steeped in sarcasm, you can never quite tell but every time I listen to it, I always wonder if there has ever been an opener quite like it and it always makes me feel incredibly uplifted. Then immediately after you have \'Paranoid Android\', which has got to be a contender as one of the greatest songs ever written, though not actually my favourite on the album. You have a song that I believe heavily deals with technology bringing out social anxiety in people - ""The yuppies networking. The panic, the vomit."" but I also get the feeling it\'s a song about revenge and living with the guilt of your actions. - ""I am paranoid, but not an android."", a song about fearing for your safety while all the time remaining true to yourself and taking comfort in that. The third song on the album is \'Subterranean Homesick Alien\' is a song which I just think is about alienation and wanting to escape. I think there\'s vague nods and science fiction influences on the album, and as a fan of things like Blade Runner, that\'s only a good thing. I was never quite sure about this song\'s meaning. Whether the alien was yourself, and it\'s a metaphor for how disassociated you are. Whether it\'s a literal extraterrestrial encounter. Whether it\'s what aliens would think about human beings, human nature and human behaviour if they could look down and see us from a distance. But I finally decided it was a song that\'s just escapism ""(I wish that they\'d swoop down in a country lane, late at night when I\'m driving. Take me on board their beautiful ship, show me the world as I\'d love to see it."" Being so disassociated, you just want something radically different. Next, you have ""Exit Music (For A Film)"". Every time I listen to it, all I can think about is Romeo and Juliet. But again, it\'s just wanting to escape. The fifth song is the best song on the album and is a contender for the best song ever written, recorded and performed. \'Let Down\' is about as perfect as music can possibly get. Beautiful, haunting, affecting, powerful, thematically dense, lyrically insightful. It\'s my favourite song on the album, which says an awful lot. I\'ve always thought that it was both about modern transport and how uneasy it makes you, but I think it\'s mainly about Frank Kafka\'s Metamorphosis. In fact, it\'s more of a continuation of that. In Kafka\'s novel, you have the protagonist who\'s a man turned insect and everyone is repulsed by him. Feeling great despair and pain, he gives up and dies alone. When \'Let Down\' starts, it really is one of the most uplifting songs on the album musically. The sweet melody comes in, the uplifting guitar starts but it\'s juxtaposed with the most emotionally devastating and despondent lyrics. It\'s such a melancholic, bittersweet and beautiful song. I think unlike in Metamorphosis, he isn\'t looking for pity (""Don\'t get sentimental, it always ends up drivel"") and despite great misery and despair, there\'s a glimmer of hope that one day it\'ll all be okay. With \'Let Down\', you have one of the best songs ever but what follows is almost just as good. \'Karma Police\' is a song that\'s incredibly bitter, scathing and angry. It\'s obviously about karma. People who have done wrong, they\'ll get what\'s coming to them. I think this is one of the most weirdly catchy songs on the album as well, every time the ""For a minute there, I lost myself bit comes in"" my heart skips a beat. Then, after the best run of songs in music, you have the song that grinds everything to an abrupt halt. It\'s most definitely the most controversial part of the entire album and even people who love all of the 11 other songs have hated this one. \'Fitter Happier\' is a song I\'ve grown to really appreciate, but it\'s kind of difficult to \'like\' it. It\'s just short of two minutes. It\'s a song that people think is where Thom Yorke went full pretense on the album, but I\'ve grown to really appreciate it. It\'s a song that has a robotic voice talking over a very simple, ominous and haunting piano melody that seems to get more and more desperate and full of despair as it goes on. The robotic voice is talking about all the things you\'re ""supposed"" to do as a healthy, well functioning human being. It\'s about how all those values can be an oppressive thing, and if you are not doing all of the things you\'re meant to, you\'ll be medicated into being a lifeless zombie on antidepressants. Not a song as such, but one of the most haunting moments on the album and I love it for that. After the slow, ominous, haunting quality of \'Fitter Happier\' the band launch into one of the loudest and powerful songs on the album in \'Electioneering\'. Again, it\'s another form of juxtaposition on the album that works so well. It sounds like The Bends-era Radiohead, much more than any other song on the album. It\'s a song that\'s about politicians and their devious nature and how they\'re morally bankrupt and will do anything to succeed and get your vote. As well as a critique of ""voodoo economics"" which is about right wing, corporate greed and cutting taxes for the rich. It\'s one of my least favourite songs on the album, but it\'s still great. Next up, you have \'Climbing Up The Walls\'. One of the most insidious and sinister songs on the album that\'s musically and lyrically incredibly dark and bleak. I think it\'s a song about mental disorders, but I\'m not too sure. Every time I listen to the album and it comes on, I always feel incredibly uneasy. After \'Climbing Up The Walls\', you have one of my most personally affecting songs on the album. \'No Surprises\', which I\'ve always considered to be one of the most existential and despairing songs on the album that\'s about how that conformist life spoken about in \'Fitter Happier\' slowly destroys you and how disaffected you feel because of it. So disaffected in fact, that suicide and death would be a release (""A handshake of carbon monoxide""). I think the best line in the song, and one of the best lyrics on the album is one I can relate to - ""A heart that\'s full up like a landfill, a job that slowly kills you."" With the album coming to an end, you\'d be forgiven for thinking that after such amazing songs, it\'d taper off, but the last two songs are incredible. \'Lucky\' is a song that I think is thematically linked to airbag, a song about escaping death. I think it\'s one of the most upbeat songs on the album in its lyrics where it\'s the only sign of any glimmer of hope. Lastly, \'The Tourist\'. The closer of the album, one of my least favourite songs on the album. But they decided to close it on a quieter, more reflective note. It\'s about being a tourist and observing how other tourists are rushed and harried, and it\'s just another critique of society. While we\'re in a busy, money orientated, consumerist society we should slow down and think about where we\'ll really going and the reasons why.\n\nIn conclusion, Ok Computer is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and it contains so many songs that I think are as good as music can get. As I said earlier, when I first listened to the album at the age of 15, it just sounded good to me but didn\'t really mean anything. But in the 6 years I\'ve been listening to it since, it has of course become incredibly important to me and has had a profound impact on my life. I can recall the exact moment WHEN this album had a profound impact on me, I was around 19 years of age and I was listening to it in the car driving somewhere. I was only half listening to it, but I was leaning up against the car window, and I was sort of phased out. I was there in body, but definitely not in mind. Suddenly, an overwhelming feeling came over me. I felt nauseous, strangely claustrophobic and incredibly vulnerable. But it was all okay, because Ok Computer was there and Radiohead felt exactly the same way. ""Transport, motorways and tramlines."" Some moments on Ok Computer are spine tingling, other moments are disturbing and some moments are simply beautiful. This is truly one of my favourite albums of all time.']",5.00 stars

moonbrush_vertigo,"[""The knowledge that you love Radiohead is like a foundation of reality, a supporting wall of your little house in the uncaring wilderness of the void. That some people can listen to OK Computer and not be awestruck, dumbstruck, thunderstruck and possibly several other hitherto-unnamed kinds of struck, or even worse, actively dislike it, is a reminder that sometimes other people seem to inhabit an entirely separate and unfathomable plain of existence.\nThom Yorke's voice is perfect - it's the kind of voice that makes me amazed to be human, and incredibly grateful that a person was born who could sing these specific words in such a way. The songwriting on every track is beyond belief. Melodic to the extremest extreme. When you realise that Let Down, which, tucked into the middle part of the album, could be likened to Stonehenge being surrounded by The Great Pyramids and The Parthenon, and yet is still miles ahead of pretty much anything any other band was doing at the time and has done since, you begin to comprehend the greatness of this album.""]",5.00 stars
marsb,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'You’ve heard it all before, so I’ll just point out what’s important for me – in no particular order:\n\n1. ”The Tourist” – the album’s worst song – is also the most fitting closer for the album, in the way that the repeated “Hey man, slow down / Idiot, slow down” links the album cyclically with its opener, “Airbag”’s “In a fast German car, I’m amazed that I survived / An airbag saved my life.” Apparently the band spent an entire day deciding on the finalized tracklist, and it really shows; not just in the opener and closer, but the whole thing really works as a cohesive unit, in a way that The Bends definitely does not.\n\n2. Ten years from now, the band would extract one of the best parts of “The Tourist” – the melody at the 0:23 mark – and recycle it for “Nude” (the “You go to hell” line) and expand on it. This is neither here nor there, I just thought I’d point that out.\n\n3. ”Lucky” is one of the two songs off OK Computer that could be criticized for its generic-ness. Without Ed O’Brien’s injection of atmosphere, we’d essentially be listening to some of the easiest-to-learn guitar chords. That being said, there is one key moment that actively excites me; when Thom Yorke takes a pause after “It’s gonna be” and belts out “A GLORIOUS DAY.” People often stereotype Radiohead’s songs as cynical music made for cynics – that one moment is a rebuttal – an affirmation of life and a testament that it’s worth living.\n\n4. The movement to catharsis within ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is another such example.\n\n5. ”Electioneering” - great title - is the other of the two songs off OK Computer that could be criticized for its generic-ness, but people who think it should have been cut off the album forget that this is a much-needed burst of energy on an album that mostly deals with the melodramatic.\n\n6. ”Fitter Happier,” everyone’s favorite spanking child on the album, manages to take the Beatles’ “Revolution 9” and condense it into 2-minutes worth. It’s terrifying, both in the background piano that’s playing from within a locked room in your house and the concept that human behaviors have become the equivalent to how we input commands into a computer, turning us into “a pig in a cage, on antibiotics.” Even if you hated the song, did it really waste all that much of your time, being 2 minutes and all? Did it really? Didn\'t think so.\n\n7. Actually, my least favorite track on the album is ""Subterranean Homesick Alien,"" not because it\'s bad, but because it\'s a summer-y song on a winter-y album. But there\'s one key moment - the quiet surroundings when Thom Yorke sings “But I’d be alright,” at the 2:55 mark and onwards, and how things go completely chaotic at the 3:17 mark, “I’m just uptight.”\n\n8. When I first heard the Smashing Pumpkins\' ""Today,"" it was a revelation to me - putting sad lyrics to a song in a major key (though upon further exploration in music, this juxtaposition isn\'t all that rare, but still).\n\n""Let Down"" is a huge improvement on that. In a comparison between the two tracks, Thom Yorke is more abstract in what he’s saying — what exactly does the repeated “You’ll know where you are with” actually mean is anyone’s best guess - but that’s a mantra if I’ve ever heard one. There isn’t anything as obvious as Corgan’s wrist-slashing “Pink ribbon scars” line, though every line in Radiohead’s best ballad (yes, it makes both “Fake Plastic Trees” and “Street Spirit (Fade Out)” look like the stuff of soap operas in comparison) is heavy-hitting. It’s an effect that’s produced by the way Thom Yorke moves from vague topics, “Transport / Motorways and tramlines” to more direct ones, “The emptiest of feelings” and “Clinging onto bottles,” or the second verse’s “Wings twitch / Legs are going” to “Don’t get sentimental / It always ends up drivel.” Furthermore, his falsetto in the song\'s last stretch is the most best use of falsetto I\'ve ever heard.\n\n9. People who accuse Radiohead has being unimaginative by offering the fact that they lifted the chord progression from “Sexy Sadie” for the bridge need to learn that there are better things to drink than haterade. Yes, that’s been well-documented, but it’s also a) the least-interesting part of that song (the rare case of a song whose verses are catchier, to say the least, than the choruses), if I were to break it down into parts and b) constitutes such a small section of the song that I’m left thinking “Who cares?” The thing about Radiohead is that they’ve managed to assimilate their influences into a package that’s accessible for people who might not have enjoyed those influences otherwise. In an extreme example, you’ve got people wearing Beatles shirts and listening to Aphex Twin songs. Anyway, I don’t have much to say about “Karma Police,” except that if you’re a novel guitarist, you might want to start there; it contains practically every chord you’ll ever need (don’t try to start with “Paranoid Android” like I did – you’ll hate yourself and your roommates will hate you too).\n\n10. Also, that ending of “Karma Police” manages to wonderfully capture that paranoid feeling you get when on certain jaunts with Mary Jane. The same goes for how inhuman Yorke sounds on “Climbing Up the Walls.”\n\n11. People bring up normal multipartite standards when praising “Paranoid Android” (The Beatles’ “Happiness is a Warm Gun,” or stupidly, Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody”), but their similarities end with the use of the adjective. Both of those tracks were uplifting; “Paranoid Android” is cathartic. There are plenty of things to note within it: the riff in the second part of the song (starting at the 1:57 mark) that secures its place as one of the most badass riffs ever; Thom Yorke’s whines at the 2:12 mark that manage to actually convey the paranoia that he sang about in the first part of the song; how Thom Yorke’s most visceral performance in his, ”You don’t remember you don’t remember why don’t you remember my name? Off with his head man off with his head man why won’t he remember my name I guess he does oooooooooooooooyeahhhhhhh,” leads right into Jonny Greenwood’s equally visceral solo at the 3:04 mark; the amount of counterpoint (especially in the slow-tempo part) within the song that could make Johann Sebastian Bach shit his pants; the way there’s a really subtle chord change in the lone acoustic strum under Thom Yorke’s final lines, “God loves his children” that signals the whole band to come crashing back in with the assaulting riff with Thom Yorke’s “Yeah!” MUSIC!\n\n12. It’s unfortunate that it’s been overlooked thanks to everyone rushing to hear the main attractions (“Paranoid Android,” “Let Down,” “Karma Police,” “No Surprises), but “Airbag” is fantastic, and much more than just an opener for “Paranoid Android” (those beeps were a fantastic idea. Speaking of the album’s cohesiveness again, Parlophone clearly understood how essential those beeps were to “Paranoid Android” that they kept them for the 2008 compilation, Radiohead: The Best Of. Unfortunately, since they were proceeded by “Just,” there was something lost in the translation – “Airbag” and “Paranoid Android” go together like pasta and pasta sauce). No, “Airbag” is a wonderful testament to Brian Eno’s work (listen to how some of Phil Selway’s drums are replaced by lasers – the same effect was done on Talking Heads’ “Thank You For Sending Me An Angel) and how much music has changed since. The whole thing sounds like it was fed into a computer (one of the few times this is meant as a compliment) from how incredibly dense the song is: the the cello’s phrasing is deliberate cut, but that barely registers because of how it interchanges with the guitar - Colin Greenwood’s bass guitar similarly creeps in and out of earshot, but sounds rush to fill the void. ""Scrolling up and down / I am born again?"" That predated the Facebook era by almost a decade.\n\n13. For me, and tons of others, this is the album equivalent of a gateway drug. After connecting with it, it became a mission to listen to the rest of Radiohead’s discography, listen to Radiohead’s influences and then listen to anything that might bear passing resemblance to Radiohead. But like drugs, every time I think I’m done with it, I put it on again and I realize how much I love every second of it. And sometimes I get mad at the album, because of how I winded up writing reviews for music on the internet that no one’s going to read instead of getting a move on my life, and then I get sort of bummed and I put on OK Computer and it doesn’t help me get un-bummed. It still sounds amazing while it’s doing that though.\n\nA']",4.50 stars

He was the drummer in Make A Rising and a trusted music head and the equally trustable Jesse was there too, saying ""yeah man, this is like a 90s prog masterpiece"", so I said ""okay, okay, I\'ll finally listen to this band"".\n\nActually, I had heard Radiohead once before, in the 90s. I was driving down to a college in Maryland to hear Noam Chomsky give a talk and one of my close high school friends was driving and he was talking about this band that was so radical or subversive or righteous or something like that, and he played some of their songs. I\'m pretty sure that was before this album came out. I remember thinking the music was pretty boring and that friend was a little mainstream in his taste, while I had already gone way into avant-garde music and seen Evan Parker, Paul Lovens and all kinds of stuff live. My friend was still in some kind of ""MTV 90 minutes"" pseudo-alternative music zone so I didn\'t take his opinion seriously. Awesome guy though. Hey, I met Noam Chomsky that day. Fuck Radiohead. But actually that song ""Creep"" was pretty cool. I think I heard it that day in my friend\'s car.\n\nSo back to this album called ""OK Computer"". So I borrowed the CD from John and played it in my car later that day. I couldn\'t make it through the whole album but I listened to maybe all but the last two tracks I think before I gave up and put on some real music. Seriously, if someone handed me an unlabelled CD and I didn\'t know anything about this band I\'d listen to like two or three tracks and say ""okay, it\'s a pretty nice mid 90s Britpop spinoff, very bland and uncreative, sounds like a thousand other bands, so it\'s not worth hearing any further"". But in actuality, I was listening to this roundabout 2005 and at that time Radiohead was a massively famous band and this album was massively popular and widely acclaimed, occasionally acclaimed by respectable music connoisseurs (e.g. some of my favorite RYMers), not just ignorant teenagers. So given that context, I felt compelled to listen to more than two or three tracks to hear what the fuss was about. Well, I never heard it. It was a pleasant pop/rock effort, with some slightly above-average production. The fact is that I really do like this kind of music in general. I grew up with it. It\'s familiar and enjoyable. I\'ve heard a million things that sound like this and it\'s just mainstream culture fluff in my opinion. Anyway, there\'s like two hundred bands in the 60s that made albums that blow this out of the water on every level. This album should not even be in the all-time top 1000 on RYM, but I\'m just making a boring rant.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I liked this album. It was a solid 3 star album with 3.5 potential, but the whiny vocals took it down a notch.\n\nMaybe someday I\'ll try to listen to this album again and get all the way through. I don\'t really doubt the positive testimonials of so many people. Oops, I accidentally reached the end of this review without even mentioning Axl Rose, one of my favorite singers. Maybe I\'ll re-write it sometime.']",3.00 stars

I can\'t pretend I like what this influenced all that well, either - but there is no denying that you can basically hear every trace of every modern rock band in this thing, and that is pretty cool. The guitars in particular actually stand out despite the fact that every band of this ilk since has (unsuccessfully, probably) tried to ape them.\n\nA common complaint about Radiohead seems to be ""pretentious"", and I don\'t feel that at all here. This feels like very honest music - like the band actually wanted to be responsible for what they were creating. I like that, even if the intent (sometimes fumbling anti-establishment messages or grey ""slow down"" Luddite stuff) isn\'t exactly what I prefer.

The poster child for this is Citizen Kane, which has suffered from this possibly more than anything else ever has ever. If I had a penny for every time I've heard “Yeah it's pretty good, not the best film ever” then I'd have enough pennies to buy each of them a History of Film college class and teach them why people say it is. It drives me flatout insane. On this site, the equivalent in terms of artist is The Beatles. One side maintains that they're the greatest band to ever lay hands on instruments and the other side maintains that they're completely overrated and their popularity is more due to a cult of personality than any sort of actual musical or creative prowess. As a huge Beatles fan who maintains that they were incredibly flawed, I get to sit in the middle and feel superior to both groups, which is grand.\n\nIn terms of albums, the Citizen Kane of music right now is OK Computer, and I will admit guilt in adopting the exact same stance that annoys me so much about the Citizen Kane naysayers. I kept a certain sense of “well they're very good, I can see why people like it, but it's not really the best album ever, is it? No, much better stuff is out there and THE MASSES just won't appreciate it. What a pity”. Also with the other sentiment of “Radiohead are good but they haven't made the album they're capable of yet”. Well, call me wrong on both counts. This is incredible, and this is their album. Kid A could soon get there as well.\n\nJesus, even the songs I don't particularly like on this have their moments. Karma Police isn't my favourite but his voice on the chorus later on, the way it shakes as it hits the high notes. Jesus fucking Christ. Fitter Happier somehow works. Why does it work? It's a fucking 2 minute sound collage thing in the middle of a fucking alt rock album. I'd love to hate it on general principle, but I can't. I like it. It's the perfect end to Karma Police and the perfect lead-in to Electioneering.\n\nOh yeah, what's with everyone hating on Electioneering? Is it because it sounds most like their old stuff? More traditional? The Bends is sitting at number 60 right now, it's not like people don't LIKE their old sound. Apart from Pablo Honey, not sure that really counts. Electioneering is one of the best songs I've heard, I'd call it the standout if not for the other standouts. They're pretty much all standouts, and standouts in twelve different ways.

wavesandwaves,"['Before you knock this off as another ""get out of the top spot"" review, allow me to explain why I feel this album is average to fairly good at best. I bought OK Computer earlier this year, with no real Radiohead experience other than ""Karma Police,"" ""Creep,"" ""Paranoid Android,"" and ""Exit Music (For a Film)."" Pretty much the bare bones of what your average person may think of when asked about Radiohead. I felt let down (pun not intended) by the album after hearing such praise given to it from virtually every institution that would care to review it, and I believe that this initial listen started off my relationship with this album on a bad note. My first review of this album consisted of a three star rating and a complaint about a mediocre album being in the top spot on this site.\n\nMy first listen went a little like ""Airbag"" (only memorable as the opening track), ""Paranoid Android,"" song, ""Exit Music,"" ""Karma Police,"" more use of the ""Paranoid Android"" voice, a strong upbeat track, ""No Surprises,"" song, and last song. The only part of this album that I really enjoyed besides the hits was ""Electioneering,"" which I thought was interesting because it was the only track that was straightforward rock. So over the next few months, I would play bits from the album and occasionally the entire album, growing more accustomed to it. I came to a point where I could see why people praised the album so frequently, but I still didn\'t ""get"" why it was at the top of so many ""best ever"" lists. I also checked out more Radiohead material, finding this less accessible than The Bends and more accessible than Kid A and their other early-2000s releases. And definitely more impressive than what I had heard from The King of Limbs.\n\nThen something interesting happened. As I grew more and more accustomed to OK Computer and Radiohead in general, this album flipped itself on its head. I realized that I was listening to the tracks that I had passed off as filler more and listening to the tracks I was originally attracted to less. Despite having only known ""Karma Police,"" ""Paranoid Android,"" and ""Exit Music"" for little more than a year, they suddenly feel as if I\'ve heard them thousands of times. I\'m tired of them, as well as the increasingly bland ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" and ""No Surprises."" When I first heard ""Paranoid Android,"" I saw a comment on its video hailing it as the ""\'Bohemian Rhapsody\' of the 90s."" It was never that, and now it feels more and more like a song made of the hurried fusion of multiple other songs. It isn\'t smooth in transitioning at all. Keep in mind that this was not a song that I fell in love with and listened to hundreds of times a day. I would only listen to it every so often.\n\nBut enough about the hits. Everybody has already said everything that needs to be said about those a thousand times over. This review is one of more than 1600 on this site alone, after all. One day recently, I played ""Airbag"" for lack of anything else that I wanted to hear. I like to associate colors on album covers with the songs (Does anyone else do this?) on the album, and whereas white is a symbol of boredom with ""Subterranean Homesick Alien,"" it suddenly became a symbol for a breath of fresh air on ""Airbag."" Had this song always sounded this good? ""Let Down"" has a shimmering guitar sound and the second best chorus on the album (only topped by the sensational ""I am born again"" on ""Airbag""). This song is really where the intricate layering of the album comes into play. ""Electioneering"" has always been a nice track, but only recently has ""Climbing Up the Walls"" turned from filler (at least in my eyes) to manic energy. ""Lucky"" may just be may just be my favorite track on the album. It has such a great pulsing sound and seems less trebly and more full sound-wise, a sound that would make so many tracks on this album even better. ""The Tourist"" is not really an ideal track, and I see it as Radiohead\'s answer to The Stooges\' ""L.A. Blues"" or ""Death Trip."" Set over deep atmospherics, it has a wild aspect to it. Even though there are lyrics, it feels like Yorke is just flowing with the music.\n\nFor most of the tracks here, this album has very little replay value. ""Paranoid Android"" may have been amazing and wholly awesome the first few plays, but eventually it\'s time to move on to more interesting things. As I mentioned before, I like to associate the main color of the album cover with the sounds it contains within. And it fits quite well here, unfortunately; OK Computer has an alienating feel to it. As a guitar player, I\'ve never been big on turning the treble up. I prefer a warmer sound, and that\'s how I feel about this album. It\'s much too trebly and sounds hollow: the prime offenders here are ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" and ""Subterranean Homesick Alien."" Cover everything you want to in reverb, but that doesn\'t mean that it will have full sound. The deep reverb worked wonderfully on ""Airbag,"" but the band should have realized that not everything will work the same way. If ever an album has suffered from a distinct lack of bass, it would be this album. Even on Metallica\'s ...And Justice for All, which has been criticized for having Jason Newsted\'s bass almost nonexistent in the mix, the sound is deeper than what is presented on OK Computer, and that\'s a big issue for me as a listener. I only just bought In Rainbows today, without hearing anything but ""15 Step"" and ""Videotape,"" and it\'s quite clear that Radiohead understood their sound issue on this album. In Rainbows has such a full, warm sound that makes most of OK Computer tremble in comparison. It doesn\'t mean that the ""alienating"" sound of this album should be removed, but the full feel of songs like ""Lucky"" should be explored on more tracks throughout the album.\n\nPossibly the biggest factor that stops this album from being the greatest of all time in my book is that none of the songs connect with the listener on a personal level. Radiohead were definitely up in the clouds during the making of OK Computer, as it\'s not an ""earthly"" or ""humanly"" album at all. Maybe that\'s the point -- I\'ve heard plenty of talk about this being based conceptually around technology, but it could have been so much more. There\'s no connection between the listener and the band, which is what makes a great album a great album. You can hear pain in Tonight\'s the Night and Nebraska. You can hear the humanity in Bitches Brew come from a group of musicians playing together for the first time. Even in the classic Pink Floyd records, you don\'t have to connect fully with the ideas of the mind breaking down or Orwellian society, but records like Dark Side of the Moon and Animals are submersive. The listener can imagine that he/she can connect with them. Radiohead\'s OK Computer, however, is not as submersive nor is it something I can connect with. Yorke\'s lyrics are praised for their ambiguity, but they aren\'t interesting. Think of some of the best lyricists of all time; none would make their songs so full of phrases and lines that don\'t go anywhere. And at times, Yorke\'s falsetto is difficult to understand. I can see that Radiohead were trying to be as different as possible, but I feel that it just didn\'t work out as they had hoped.\n\nOverall, OK Computer is a collection of both good and bad tracks. Which tracks are which are entirely up to you, and sometimes they might even surprise you (as they did me). But the good tracks, while awesome, still seem shallow and alienating. It isn\'t really the tracks themselves, but the atmosphere and hollowness of the album that makes it a two star album. It\'s certainly not the best album out there, and hopefully I\'ve been able to lay out a compelling case for such a point of view.']",2.00 stars

I would never subscribe to the notion of them being 'groundbreaking' or particularly innovative but they have released some records that have pricked my ears up.\n\nI was so eager to hear their new record (after loving 'The Bends') that I took the day off work (yes I'm that old) and queued up for this record on the day of it's release.\n\n14 years later and I'm still reeling from the bitter disappointment that I felt on that day. Radiohead became tainted in my eyes and although the good will I have towards the band resurfaced upon subsequent releases, it was never the same. This record is the one that I avoid. That day 14 years ago was the only time this record has had an emotional impact on me. Whenever I hear it I feel nothing whatsoever. Perhaps that's the point, but personally, I listen to music because I want to perhaps be enlightened to some degree and to this end gain some satisfaction, maybe feel a certain way, be it happy or sad, desolate, devastated, angry or whatever variations of those states that you can come up with. Something at least.\n\nI don't find the records message and themes particularly enlightening, original, engaging or engrossing either. Every generation has it's own thing, it's own struggles, the monotony and utter meaninglessness of what and who we are and what we do, the absolute terror that our existence is when you pause and think about it for a minute. It's nothing new. Records like this have been released for years previous to this one.\n\nThe production values here are poor and samey and I believe that sonically it has dated very badly (much more so than 'The Bends')...and this record holds some of my least favourite Radiohead songs... 'Electioneering' for example. Seriously? It sounds just like the stereophonics. Paranoid Android is a great name for a song despite it's Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy references (which litter the record in fact), but it is dull and lifeless and feels forced, I can even hear the joins between 'movements' which serves to cement my opinion that the record is badly produced.\n\nThe only 2 tracks I like on here are 'Let Down' and 'Fitter Happier.'\n\nThe Bends, Kid A, Amnesiac, Hail to The Thief, In Rainbows and King of Limbs are much better records than this.\n\nEasily the most over rated release in the history of popular music.

Otra parte de la juventud cree que es una gran banda de Rock Alternativo y experimental, creadores del disco The Bends (1995) y sobre todo de crear el que muchos llaman el DARK SIDE OF THE MOON de la decada de los 90s (Nombre dado por los progres y algunos gerentejos que solo se afanan en coimear), asi es me refiero a su gran obra OK COMPUTER de 1997.\n\nEl disco abre con Airbag, una de las canciones mas sensacionales del disco que da la sensacion de dar vueltas en un espiral en un lapso en que sufres y te salvas de un accidente de milagro.

I wish I could create riffs like these. Jonny Greenwood is now one of my top favorite guitarists. What I like about him is that his guitar playing sounds like it was influenced by Pink Floyd and the Pixies. This is an album in which people would argue that it is derivative, but even though one can easily trace the influences, the end product still feels like something new and unique.\n\nNot only musically, but lyrically this record shines. The focal point of the lyrics seem to be on the rise of technology having a stronger hold on society, but it more or less seems to generally touch upon the alienation that many go through trying to live in the western society. This is reminiscent to the themes that are covered in many punk rock records, but when you combine these heavy themes with the melancholic sound of Radiohead, you get the same message but galvanizing in a way that feels more poignant. The way the words are delivered by Thom Yorke really brings out the depth of the lyrics and the music. Not only that, but the whole band shines as a unit.\n\nContrary to the despondent tone of the themes touched upon in the lyrics, soundwise the music to me surprisingly sounds like music for a beautiful day. There are moments where the album goes into darker territory from 'Exit Music' to 'Climbing the Walls,' but songs like 'Let Down' and especially 'The Tourist' are what really drives the tone of the record. 'OK Computer' is like a long lonely walk through a beautiful sunny metropolitan area and nothing else brings me back to the 90's as much as this album.""]",5.00 stars
nipper_o_figs,"['This is a great pop album. It took a few listens to enjoy this to its fullest. I think why it took so long for me to like the album the way I do now is because of the outrageous amount of unjustified praise it has.\n\nThe album is great, like I\'ve already underlined but why oh why best album ever? Radio Head brings nothing...nothing new to pop/rock/music with these songs. Admit it..\n\nIts charm is found in the vocal, instrument and timing simplicity and some cool atmospheric sounds. That said, the vocals are not well sung. The lyrics are goofy and make no sense. So much effort went into being cute every single moment of every single song. Its like being force fed a whole pint of honey in less than 30 seconds, it\'s nice and sweet, but toward the end your going to choke and vomit and just maybe never be able to enjoy ""honey"" again.\n\nPet Shop Boys are much better in all facets, and they have been doing this much longer.\n\nI would recommend this album to anyone, but 5 stars? Never.']",3.00 stars

Omega_Switch,"['OK Computer... an album that garners so much respect and yet so much hate. No matter one\'s opinion of it, OK Computer is a milestone in the history of modern music. It did not completely revolutionize modern music, nor did it introduce any novel style. What it did was blend a variety of influences, ranging from Pink Floyd and David Bowie to Pixies and even Miles Davis- Yorke has stated that the sounds of Bitches Brew fundamentally influenced the creation of this album-, with creative zeal and seamless execution, all packaged in an accessible yet sonically varied alternative rock sound. This mix proved to be just right for the time, as it was almost immediately received as a modern classic. The popularity they had gained from Pablo Honey and the respect they had received from The Bends secured OK Computer\'s popularity, but its reputation far exceeds anything that came about from those two albums. Say what you will about any of its pretensions- of which there are many-, what Radiohead accomplished here is no small feat; this is no average alternative rock album. Structurally, it flows with subtle progressions, utilizing many layers of sound to produce an inviting yet intricate atmosphere. While Kid A and Amnesiac would be electronic albums at heart, this is still a rock album at the core. The electronic elements simply add flavor to the mix, accentuating Greenwood and O\'Brien\'s simple yet highly effective guitar chords and harmonies and Yorke\'s passionate vocal delivery and lyrics. The lyrical themes themselves are sufficient for a full-length review, but I will leave that study in ""post-modern"" social commentary to more accomplished critics. My only significant gripe here is that the album grows slightly tiring after ""No Surprises"", as the last two tracks sound like filler more than anything else- although ""The Tourist"" has its moments.\n\nIn other words, screw the haters. This deserves respect.']",5.00 stars

Nesquik,"['Have you ever had someone tell you that something is the greatest thing ever? Maybe your friend thought Inception was the best movie of all time. Maybe your girlfriend says that the DQ blizzard she is enjoying is the best thing ever. She\'s probably getting fat and you don\'t like that. Maybe someone is saying that some album by Radiohead is the best thing to happen to music ever (or at least since the 60s). Perhaps it\'s not just one person. Perhaps it\'s a whole bunch of people. Perhaps it\'s everyone.\n\nThat\'s the way it is for OK Computer. I\'m not just talking about RYM, either. Actually, RYM isn\'t even the place where this band is worshiped the most, which is insane considering this album seems to bounce around the top 3 on the RYM charts here. That\'s also quite fascinating to me as well. I\'ve never actually really listened to Radiohead, but the fact that an album from 1997 is rivaled only by a couple of albums by the Beatles for overall rating on this website is pretty amazing.\n\nLiving under my rock and listening only to my Emperors, my Neurosises and my other metals, it still is kind of hard for me to understand how an album can be so universally loved. I know a lot of people (I\'m mostly talking about the people who listen to music thoroughly, not your garden variety Eminem fans) who don\'t like some of the other top albums from around here like Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. With Radiohead, I have 40 friends on this site who have rated OK Computer and their ratings actually average out to an amazing 4.49 (8th highest rated album by my RYM friends and remember that I listen to almost exclusively metal). Over half of those ratings are 5 star ratings, too.\n\nDoes it live up to it\'s praise? Well, I\'m not expecting it to. This isn\'t really my favourite type of music. I\'ve listened to this band in small doses before, youtubing them or just listening to a song here and there out curiosity to see if they really are all that. They\'d never really grabbed me all that much. Sure, ""Paranoid Android"" is pretty awesome, but I didn\'t find anything close to that in quality.\n\nThen I heard ""Airbag"" and that changed. My attitude towards this album quickly changed from cautious and a little bit skeptical to a sort of surprised excitement. Two songs in, this album is awesome. The last ten songs, however, do not match up in individual quality. Not even close. That\'s okay, though. This is an album that I know if I listened to any song on it\'s own I would not enjoy it nearly as much as I would if I was listening to the album in it\'s entirety. This has probably been said before and often, but this is an album. It isn\'t a collection of songs. It is meant to be listened to as a whole and it works best as a whole. The mood and the flow of this album is actually pretty incredible.\n\nTo be honest, I was actually less than impressed with this album my first listen. I was a little more impressed with my second listen. It seems to be how it works with people, though. This is an album that grows and I would expect it to grow a little bit more on me. I don\'t think I could ever understand the personal connections or how much this album means to some people, but I at least understand a little bit why this album is so popular.']",4.00 stars
a2jbeav,"['Writing a review for _OK Computer_ should be like shooting fish in a barrel. All you have to do is throw around words like ""experimental"", ""weird"", ""sparse"", ""lush"", ""depressing"", ""classic"", ""magnum opus"", and my personal favorite ""messy masterpiece"". And just like that you have a cookie-cutter review which is socially acceptable to just about all of your trendy friends.\nWhat\'s really funny about that previous paragraph is all the terms used above are spot on. _OK Computer_ is ""depressing"" (""Let Down"", ""No Surprises""). _OK Computer_ is experimental (""Paranoid Android""). _OK Computer_ is sparse (""Exit Music"", ""The Tourist""). _OK Computer_ is lush (""Airbag"", ""Subterranean Homesick Alien""). _OK Computer_ is weird (""Fitter Happier"", ""Climbing Up the Walls"").\n_OK Computer_ is all those things and more, thus the album has come to take on a history of its own. You\'d be hard pressed to find a legitimate ""Greatest Albums"" list that doesn\'t have this towards the top, and rightfully so. It\'s the kind of album that makes a band, and one that can often pigeon-hole. How the hell do you top this? For Radiohead it was exploring their sound to a profound extreme while still being considered rock. _Kid A_ is a great result of the frustration of trying to top something that they couldn\'t.\nAs for _OK Computer_, it\'s the kind of album that taken piecemeal feels as though it can\'t work, but somehow the track numbering is right on, and the album became a symbol for the frustration of the \'90s.

It\'s Radiohead\'s best record, and arguably the best record of the \'90s. What\'s left to say about it? Every song (not including the interlude ""Fitter Happier,"" but nobody ever includes that one) is great. The album\'s first six songs is up there with the best first half of any record. ""Airbag"" starts pretty abruptly, and it\'s a bit of a difficult record to take in all at once - the angular guitars of ""Airbag"" leading into the shape-shifting classic ""Paranoid Android"" into the spacey ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" and then into the tense, claustrophobic ""Exit Music,"" and it doesn\'t let up from there. Every song sets its own distinct mood (maybe except for ""Electioneering,"" a more straightforward rocker, even if it\'s a great song).

LetDown7,"['Many times have a tried to right a review for this album but I know that nothing I can say will live up to what this masterpiece truly is. Here in my opinion is the last physical classic album in an age when technology was advancing every so rapidly. This is probably and always will be one of the most fullfilling listening experiences I have ever had. Why do I say this you may ask? Well let me break it all down for you and tell you why I became obsessively addicted to this fine piece of era defining rock music. Let me get this straight in saying that this album is extremely unique and there is nothing like it that borders on the creative experimental force of electronic effects and compelling guitar riffs. The Beatles came very close to this and are probably the closest piece of music I could relate this to. Lets just say it feels like a mix of Pink Floyd\'s Dark Side of the Moon and The Beatles Revolver.\nOK Computer is nothing short of a monumental and could be regarded as one of the best albums of all time to music critics. Kid A is also a masterpiece in its own right but I feel as if this being more rock oriented. OK Computer is extremely cool, but besides that the lyrics are extremely personal and relatable. Here Thom Yorke has moved on and matured in his songwriting once again. We see Thom\'s writing to be weak in Pablo Honey at times until we reach to there second release The Bends. I feel as if The Bends talk about relationships in a more mature manner then Pablo Honey. While The Bends is a deeply personal record OK Computer is personal but feels distant. It actually feels like Thom is talking to the modern man. Themes of isolation in his lyrics are more prominent then ever before.\nIf you really listen to The Bends and I mean really listen, you can see this coming. The end of (Nice Dream) has effects to it near the end that will show up all of the time in OK Computer. Bullet Proof I Wish I was has effects that add and complete the song also. So lets get to the album, from Johnny\'s guitar riff in the beginning of Airbag you just know that this album is going to be epic from the get go. The drumming is what really stands out in this track. It\'s almost like a machine and carries the song throughout with a bass line that is unpredictable. But what really grabs me about this song is song is the imagery, I actually get an adrenaline rush every single time I listen to this song. I feel like im traveling down the highway in a car going 80 miles an hour. The song is about surviving a car crash. Like a sudden WAKE UP to yourself. ""In an interstellar burst im back to save the universe"". You feel as if you are invincible and its like a sudden realization that death could happen at any minute and I could die so I need to live life to the fullest. Radiohead\'s music is known as depressing but this song is the most uplifting song I have ever listened to. The effects at the end create such a futuristic atmosphere that it feels like the music is alive and just I dont know how to put it.....dancing, this music is ALIVE!\nParanoid Android feels eery from the beginning. But the way this track builds and changes keeps you on your feet the entire time. It\'s like Bohemian Rhapsody only 10X better, it feels extremely cold and lost as the computer voice talks to you saying ""I may be paranoid, but I am no android"". ""Ambition makes you look pretty ugly"" we as humans crave ambition but Thom is going against this idea an notion almost every american craves in modern society. JOHNNY\'s GUITAR RIFF!......holy shit. It grabs you and pulls you in and transcends into an ultimate explosion. Until it reaches a human plea. A final stand as if you feel as if you are kneeling to god. Asking for one last chance to change it around. Begging for mercy as if something from the heavens will reach you and touch you and take you away from the craziness of reality. Beautiful stuff guys.....first time I heard it I was utterly speechless and it moved me to tears.\nSubterranean Homesick Alien is about a man who is bored and tired with his normal life. He feels as if there must be something more out there. He cant relate to the people around him and wants to get out of his town were he feels like he is stuck and his fate to die there. ""There all UPTIGHT UPTIGHT"" he can\'t stand the life around him. This song reminds me of my parents. How there lives suddenly become dull and uptight about everything because they feel as if there safe if they are. Worrying all the time and dont always understand what is important in life. They need to let loose. So sometimes I do feel like I just want Aliens to take me away in a sense and start a new life. To see what really is out there. To go away and disappear to somewhere far away because I dont feel like a belong here (Creep reference). But sometimes I want to scream this song to adults who are UPTIGHT with there old age. They become worn down by modern society.\nExit Music (For a film), so so haunting. Its about Romeo and Juliet. Telling her that its time to leave there families and start there own life together and never see them again. But there parents are blinded by the fact that they love each other because they have there differences and absolutely hate each other. They tell each other to calm down because they are so angry at there family for not knowing how they feel. ""Breath...keep breathing, dont lose your nerve"". There families hate there love so in turn they hate there own family. They cant breath without each other so if one dies they both die because they are one. ""Sing us a song.....a song to keep us warm, there\'s such a chill, such a chiilll"". Then the creepy kid voices come in and I feel extremely cold and hopeless. I feel frozen to the spot. ""WE HOPE THAT YOU CHOKE....THAT YOU CHOKE"". Wow. Those lyrics are unreal and filled with so much anger and coldness.\nLet Down, probably my favorite song on the album. So sad but at the same time feels so beautiful and uplifting. The piano and the off kilter time signature is beautiful. Going back to the them of transportation every time im in a car,plane, or train listening to this it fits the mood perfectly. As you look at the window in your car you see the highway in front of you. Cars moving past your face and thinking about how some of those people might feel driving home from a long day at work.....alone. The expectations of millions of people at once feeling let down because it didn\'t live up to what it thought it would. You simply let down again and it happens every single day. It happens over and over until you become cold hearted shell of a person. You simply are worn out by life in general. Your clinging on to things that you make you happy but which in turn you aren\'t feeling the love and emotion you once felt as a child. The computer bleeps at the end and the crascendo build up to a magnificent focal point. ""You know where you are with, floor collapsing falling bouncing back and one day I am gonna grow wings, a chemical reaction"". Again saying that one day you are going to escape all of this but it may never happen.\nKarma Police has to deal with how we curse other people. Saying that we want bad things to happen to certain people that put us down. Praying that justice will soon catch up with them and in turn there is a balance in the universe. He is different so I dont like him. ""Her hitler hairdo, is making feel ill/he talks in maths"" He is a jew therefore I cannot love him. He is black so we cant see eye to eye and you cursed me to hell. Damn you all burn in hell because I never did anything to you, it is never my fault it is always yours. Begging for some force to damn them. ""This is what you get when you mess with us"". But then he realizes he is at fault for calling on the Karma police to get them. Therefore he in turn is just as evil as the person persecuting him. ""Phew for a minute I lost myself"". He feels as if he is losing his mind. Why are bad things happening to me if I didn\'t do anything wrong. So it buzzes in his head and never stops......hes going crazy. If he believes in Karma why is it happening to him?\nFitter Happier, the ideal way a person should be. Trying to as perfect as possible and comfortable and safe. As we try to perfect ourselves we become dull and fake. The media shows us false information on how we should really be if we want to live a full and happy life. But we become stuck in routines and like a computer. Programmed to do what we are told by the media. We become lost because everyone else is behaving in this same manner. So we behave in the same manner as everyone else in society to fit in. But the person is like a pig in a cage no matter what he can never escape. He was programmed from birth to behave in a certain way. It\'s telling us this is how we should live our life. DON\'T LISTEN! rebel against the same be unpredictable and don\'t get stuck in routine because it will kill you......\nElectioneering, politics that aren\'t for the people. The canidate will stop for nothing. He will say the right things even though he probably won\'t act upon them when he is in office. ""I go forwards and you go backwards....and somewhere we will meet"". Sarcastic view on how the Republican and Democratic party will see eye to eye and get things done. But in reality nothing really gets down when both sides are fighting. This is the ultimate political protest song. With Johnny once again showcasing his insane guitar ability. Although I feel as if this could have fit on The Bends better it is the only weak point on the whole album. Not saying that its filler but something else like something off of Airbag How Am I Driving EP could have fit this spot better in my opinion.\nIm going to sum it up here and talk about four songs to wrap it up in one paragraph because I know this is to long of a review. Climbing Up The Walls is about someone who is depressed and can\'t fight it away. It may be about Thom\'s own depression. Again a bleak outlook saying that there is no escape. That the person himself is depression and it is who they are. No Suprises is one of the singles and has a beautiful tune just as Let Down has. But talks about a man commiting suicide by turning on his car in his garage and killing himself with carbon monoxide poisoning. The man in the album has become so cold and lifeless that he finds no point in living anymore in this material world. Lucky is a sarcastic view on how things will change but probably never will. The Tourist is like the exact opposite of airbag. Slow moving and its almost like the world flashing before your eyes before you crash. That everyone in the world needs to slow down and look at the world around them. Do people ever question what is going on around them? Do we ever take the time to smell the flowers and love life before it all slips away? Don\'t worry and the troubles in your life are only temporary live life to the FULLEST! Troubles aren\'t the end of you. I feel as if the story is about a man who saw life as depressing and a terrible place to be and went crazy........but never really stopped the craziness in time. Tragic but we all feel like this. The Computer crashed.\n\n\n\n\n10/10']",5.00 stars

Vamos a ver, si está tan alto y votado por taaanta gente será por algo ¿no? simplemente este SÍ que fue el mejor disco de los 90.\n\nLa música necesitaba un soplo de aire fresco, algo nuevo e innovador que no se esperara nadie, algo que pegara fuerte y redefiniera las pautas. Si analizamos las decadas de la música vemos como esto siempre ha ocurrido, así que tarde o temprano tenía que hacerlo alguien, y ese alguien le tocó a Radiohead en una epoca donde el Grunge empezaba a invadir todos lados, en una epoca que nadie se esperaba que se pudiera rizar más aún el rizo de la originalidad.\n\n\nPero, para redefinir las pautas tienes que calar hondo, y la mejor formula es tener temas realmente buenos que lleguen a la gente, y joder si lo hizo, el experimento funcionó a las mil maravillas, puede que en parte por este eclectico compacto de estilos y gustos. Algo grande estaba pasando y Radiohead empezaba a hacerse leyenda...\n\n\nAirbag es de lo mejor, Yorke se sale aquí con esa voz constante ante una canción hermosa, si hay que hacer canciones bonitas deberian ser así como mínimo.

Let Down nos daba ganas de acabar con todo de una vez, nos animaba de sobremanera y me es imposible imaginarme a alguien que no se haya levantado de su asiento al escucharla en un grito clamando lo que queremos, eso es hacer una canción de estas que suben poco a poco con mucha clase. Karma Police es una canción atípica y quizás una obra maestra por como en pocos minutos se puede decir tanto. Despues de un corte quieres mover el esqueleto para más tarde volverte ñoño (en buen plan) con tanta belleza y terminar tranquilo y relajado despues de este viaje que no te puedes llegar aún a creer.\n\n\nGRANDIOSO, esa es mi única palabra que me puede salir. Para entender este disco hay que analizarlo más compositivamente, ya nos gustaría a muchos tener unas ideas tan geniales en tan poco tiempo y reunirlas en un disco. Compositivamente es un disco perfecto, nivelado y bien pensado, hay que ver más allá para entender a las obras maestras y si ha esto le añadimos lo que supuso para una cultura pues como que la cosa se rendodea casi a lo imposible.\n\n\n¡Bravo!']",
my_granny,"[""I really wish I could have listened to this album without the awerness of the whole hype that surrounds it. Because of that, I expected god knows what kind of uber-epiphany that will change my life forever. What I’ve got, is an average alt rock record with extremely annoying vocals and pseudo-intellectual lyrics.\nMusic-wise it’s basically the same stuff as on The Bends, with occasional trip hop beats in the background. And as on Radiohead’s previous effort there are some decent songs, with really pretty melodies and even interesting structure. However, most of the tracks lose their momentum after a minute or so, or are just plain bad (Electioneering). The only exception, that I honestly like is the opening Airbag.\nAnd just as before, the thing that makes this album practically unlistenable for is Thom Yorke’s unbearable voice. Most of the time he sounds like a crying little boy deprived of his favourite teddy bear some time ago, with occassional fits of hysteria, when he remembers how much he loved that bear. Also the lyrics, criticizing the yuppie culture and dehumanization of man (if I got that right), are average at best.\nTo sum up, there’s a hint of evolution in the introduction of elements of trip hop, but apart from that the band copies their winning (in terms of sales) formula from The Bends. The fact that this is the highest rated album on RYM is astonishing.\n\nHighlight:\n+ Airbag\n\nLowlights:\n- Fitter Happier (we all know it's fun to play with the voice synthesizer, but come on!)\n- Electioneering (just a very poor song)\n- Climbing Up the Walls (Yorke’s whining at its worst)""]",2.00 stars

Patapunfete,"['So it\'s finally come to this...the album proclaimed by so many overprivileged white teens and 20-somethings to be the greatest recording ever created by man. I remember when I was in high school, I worked with a guy at a supermarket (yes obviously it was Whole Foods) that told me he wanted to destroy his stereo and shatter his eardrums after listening to OK Computer because nothing else he would ever hear in his life could possibly compare to what he had just experienced. Needless to say I was skeptical, and growing up in white suburbia...this album was the favorite of the majority of my classmates and I tried my hardest to resist it\'s evil pull.\n\nBy the time college came around, I cautiously gave this ""dangerous"" album a listen and was completely underwhelmed. The hype built around this behemoth was immeasurable and the product, while certainly well written and decently executed simply did not resonate with me the way it had with so many of my peers. OK Computer has a lot of great tracks, ""Airbag"", ""Paranoid Android"", ""Exit Music (For A Film)"", ""Karma Police"", etc., and to be fair none of the songs are bad (at least objectively), but I have wrestled for years on what separates this album from some of my favorite albums. I recently came up with a few reasons why I do not consider this to be one of the greatest albums of all time, (or even the decade):\n\n1) Radiohead is too subtle with much of their overdubbing/layering...Now the vocal layerings for the most part are flawless, but the guitar overdubs are often downplayed and too subtle to even follow (I often don\'t even notice that they are there). I understand that this is ""part of the mystique and atmosphere"" of the album, but come on...quite pretentious.\n2) I think Thom Yorke had a root canal during ""Fitter Happier"" because he seems incapable of enunciating words on the second half of the album...I mean the band might as well have had the lead singer of Sigur Rós for tracks 8-12...cause I have no idea what he\'s singing half the time.\n3) The track ""The Tourist"" just ends...so many of the tracks have very downplayed and subtle build-ups and then stop abruptly, the final track is no exception (and stands out more cause it\'s the last track).\n4) After a discussion with my buddy Chuck (rym user aborodin), I realized that one of the biggest problems with the album is that there is no real moment of catharsis. Radiohead teases you with big build-ups and flashes of emotional expulsions (on ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Karma Police"" specifically), but there is no moment on this album where I get a shiver down my spine and feel complete...Some examples of what I mean are as follows:\n-the guitar break-out at the end of ""Only in Dreams"" on Weezer [Blue Album].\n-The string build-up at the end of ""Still Life"" on Dog Man Star.\n-The Climactic ""Ode to Joy"" chorus from Beethoven\'s 9th Symphony.\n-The guitar solo on ""Stairway to Heaven"" from Led Zeppelin [IV].\n-Quite possibly my favorite musical movement of all time, the final verse (As Sure as Eggs is Eggs) of ""Supper\'s Ready"" from Foxtrot and the subsequent guitar fill by Steve Hackett:\n\n""Can\'t you feel our souls ignite\nShedding ever changing colours, in the darkness of the fading night,\nLike the river joins the ocean, as the germ in a seed grows\nWe have finally been freed to get back home.\n\nThere\'s an angel standing in the sun, and he\'s crying with a loud voice,\n\'This is the supper of the mighty One\',\nThe Lord of Lords,\nKing of Kings,\nHas returned to lead His children home,\nTo take them to the New Jerusalem.""\n\nNow THAT is catharsis, and in the end, that\'s really what OK Computer lacks...(NB- not every album requires such a musical feat, but for title of ""greatest album of all-time"", you certainly do). For all it does right, this is a great collection of songs and ironically for all of it\'s overproduction, it just feels incomplete...but hey at least it\'s better than Kid A. A really good album, and a must-listen...just not the best of the decade. Great!\n\n-MMM']",4.00 stars

PlasmaXWisp,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'OK Computer is a great album and more than enough has been written to justify why that\'s so. Whether you wanna call it THE Album of the 90s, or Album of the Century, people who love this album can agree that it\'s prophetic in its vision, and it\'s completely unique sounding even for the time. It certainly withstands the test of time.\n\nHowever, it\'s also very misunderstood. When I first listened to this as a high-schooler I hated every second of it, and I didn\'t even complete the album. This was also true of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th times I listened to it. I hated Thom\'s stupid high-pitched nasally voice; I hated how his name was Thom spelt like that; I hated the depressing nature of the lyrics. All I wanted was some music with some OOOMPH, and OK Computer wasn\'t cutting it. (Looking back, it\'s strange how I didn\'t like it because this album is equally as angsty as I was at the time. I eventually came to realize that there are a lot of powerful OOOMPH-y songs on here, but they don\'t deliver OOMPH the same way as some of Radiohead\'s radio cohorts do (a failing of modern rock radio if you ask me).)\n\nI kept giving it periodic tries, trying to believe the hype. Then one day, when I was in my early 20s, it finally clicked. I liked the whole thing, front to back, and totally got it. It was full of sound and soul, of helplessness and desperation, of buildups and crashes, of torture and serenity. What changed? The world changed. Broadband internet and streaming video was the norm; smartphones became ubiquitous; social media made us all feel simultaneously connected and isolated. I certainly was older but age is not what helped me like the album (listening to OK Computer is not like reading Siddhartha). Broad musical exposure definitely helped, but that wasn\'t it either. Weed definitely helped, but that wasn\'t it. It also wasn\'t coming to the realization of how much it reminds me of The Wall. I was 7 when this album came out...why did I appreciate it now? What ultimately did it was this realization:\n\nWE LIVE IN AN INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS AND ISOLATED S O C I E T Y!\n\nNow go, angsty teen who thinks Thom Yorke\'s voice makes him sound like a whiny bitch, go listen to OK Computer with headphones on. You\'ll realize that he IS a whiny bitch, just like we all are. You\'ll get tingles on your skin when Thom screams at the top of his lungs at the end of ""Climbing up the walls"". You\'ll cry after the bridge of ""Let Down"". You\'ll appreciate the slow build-up of ""Exit Music (for a Film)"", and your jaw will drop when you figure out it was for some shitty Leo DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet movie.

onethink,"[""Shit, I was hoping to be the first person to review this album but someone got there before me. When I first heard this I thought Radiohead were the most significant and interesting British rock band since the days of Cream and Soft Machine, but I wasn't sure that I actually liked them. My problems? I don't like the inexpressive singing - there are times when inexpressive singing can be effective, Lou Reed, for instance, whose voice seems unable to hold any emotional content but that suites the deadpan horrors of his songs, we are never sure whether he is being ironic or not - but here I just find it a long whinge (and of course there is a certain tradition of English whingy singers). And I don't like the lyrics - this can be put down to a matter of taste, but they are always too self-consciously clever, too self-consciously weird, too self-consciously arty, a series of clever lines that don't add up to a song but a posture. So what did I like about them? They come up with some superb melodies, which they then attack with electronic noise. Listen to the first track, although not one of their strongest melodies, there is something there that is hummable, but then, over a fairly straight forward rhythm, the electric guitars thunder into it, assaulting the likeability of the song: this happens time after time and creates a real tension in the music, a sense of promise that is constantly frustrated. But then I got further doubts: like a lot of ambitious rock the result is a certain bombast, and they are not above cliché: listen to Exit Music, the moment when the drums come in and the song seems to go up a gear: that is just corny; and the backing vocals which become a choir going aaaahhhh - this is like pouring syrup over the melody. Underneath the electronic aggression they are a very sentimental band: it's all a bit easy: there is a certain lack of real imagination. Listening to the album is like sitting next to a drunk in a bar, one moment he is aggressively belligerent, the next he is maudlinly sentimental: at first there may be a certain excitement in this, the threat of the unexpected, of a danger, but it quickly becomes a routine, a bit obvious, a bit dull. (Which leaves the question did rock run its course about 35 years ago, did it run out of musical ideas, since then just revisiting the same territory time after time?)""]",2.50 stars
BabeHardy,"['Hey, this album needs another review, right? Well, no...not really, but none of these hundreds of reviews and thousands of ratings really mean anything at all anymore so why don\'t I fling some monkey-poo at the wall anyway. Upon it\'s release, I bought it - I liked the first two albums, felt there was a progression happening, something intelligent going on. I was deeply impressed (for awhile) by it\'s sheer proggy-ness, it\'s attempted reach into some spooked out atmosphere, referencing some of Lennon\'s darker White Album material and sprinkling a post-Pixies dust over top of it. But that was 1997, and it didn\'t take long for every pseudo-hipster to tag this album as some kind of important landmark in music, and this was one of those times that kind of bandwagon jumping left a nasty singe in my brain. Radiohead were actually forced into commercial suicide from the wake of this album\'s reputation. But - whatever....my own personal end-result of this whole scene the album created was to pretty much shelve it for the next decade. Whenever I did pull it out, the only track I\'d really ever play was ""Fitter Happier"" - which probably says something about me that I\'m not particularly proud of.\n\nLast night I pulled this off the shelf and played it from start to finish, with a large whiskey sour and my rapt attention. Listening to this cycle of songs that are filled with fear and dread, I started to feel uncomfortable. Doomed, even. There is no comfort in this album, it\'s the continuous sound of things falling apart, the world falling out from under your feet. It\'s not pleasant. But it is so achingly beautiful in places, I cannot deny that. Yorke\'s vocals feel like depression incarnate, like an ill animal trapped in a room festering with cockroaches. The music and it\'s production try to piggy-back onto this vibe, and mostly succeeds. But then there\'s that last track which doesn\'t fall into the mood of the other eleven, it\'s making a somewhat vain attempt to end on some kind of twisted hopeful air. It fails completely, but has some brilliant harmonic structures and phrases. The whole of the listen left me with a feeling of unlucky prophecy. And, really, that\'s uncool. This will have to stay back on the shelf until I hit some moment in life where it\'s appropriate to listen again. On a side note, the only other album that gives me this vibe is Pink Floyd\'s ""Animals"" - which, like this, stays on the shelf mostly (despite a healthy respect for it\'s content) and is something I can only listen to when it\'s the right emotional moment.']",4.00 stars

It must hence be said that as such, you must have the patience to fall in love with it or hate it, but you must give yourself the time to make up your own opinion, and don\'t let yourself be influenced by the high position it gets from this website, although I personally believe that you could be a lot worse off. This album is great. Its sound is so ahead of any time that it represents a futuristic world that it doesn\'t like, and that explains the title, or perhaps could be taken as a representation. The songs are often invaded by digital and technoligic sounds that blow us away and initially even annoy us, but we go on to love them as they progress in the song. An example of this is found in ""Let Down"", with the synth that sonds like old video game sounds harpeggios, so surreal yet so fitting in the overwhelming sound that can be found throughout the album, indeed from the first track to the last.\n\nIt is perhaps the way the sound is so full and so overwhelming that on first listen we are fascinated by it, but on second listen we feel completely oblivious, and begin to strangly support the thesis that this album is overrated. It is possible to think so during and after the second listen, but it\'s important, when exposed to this album, to give it another shot, because it is only after the thrid listen that we appreciate this album as a music album. The paradox is that the album lives, thinks and breathes to be a ""non-music album"", the anti-pop-rock album, almost stripped of any sing along choruses or hum along riffs. Whenever you expect Radiohead to play one chord, they play an unlikely one instead, and leave the pop version of their music to Muse, the poppy version of Radiohead. On a musical point of view, this is very admirable and avant garde, something that probably hasn\'t even been fully appreciated yet, but is surely starting to be aknowledged. This is not an album to please the crown, this is an album to find one, and haunt it forever. The meanings of the lyrics have something that sounds like a paranoid futuristic, or if you will ""subterranean homesic"" version of Morrissey, diluting haunting one liners like the iconic and representative ""kicking squealing gucci little piggy"" in Paranoid Android or ""For a minute there I lost myself"" that are lines that don\'t follow a narrative pattern but are deeply rooted in the unsafety of the human mind and species, and has been so since the beginning of time.\n\nThe most chart friendly track and the one to be loved from the beginning is Karma Police, but not for that reason is it the best album.

His voice can be so chilling, soothing but at the same time frantic and worried. This is perhaps shown best by my favorite song on the album ""Exit Music (for a film)"" At one point, this is a beautiful love song about escaping and at the same time is a frantic plead for somebody to help Thom run away. The song is so basic, but once the climax hits......I can\'t describe it at all. So filling, so emotional, so loving, god it is beautiful. Especially once he starts yelling ""we are one in everlasting peace"" amazing line.\n\nWhat is truly so amazing about this album is that my favorite song on the album constantly changes. One month, I\'m like ""Man Airbag is a classic"", the next month I\'ll be saying ""Yea sure its a classic, but Lucky is even better."" Kinda hard to describe what I mean by that but, I love it, because I look forward to every song on this album.\n\nClimbing Up the Walls and Fitter Happier are usually at the root of complaints for most people (well actually, most people don\'t have any complaints about this album), but thing is they fit in so well with the album it works no matter if its a favorite or not. Plus, they really show off their more experimental side on those songs and I\'m really glad they did, because it adds even more variety to this already flawless album.\n\nSo pretty much its obvious by now that this is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard.

It fits the haunting, atmospheric nature of the music, sure, but to me it comes across somewhat grating. Then we come to the consistency of the album, which measured on it's own is excellent and keeps the listener well within the melancholic whimsy of each consecutive track. There are a few good tracks, and most of the others are above-average Britindiepop fare. I'll definitely give this a few more listens, but it's hard to believe that I'll be moved any closer to the gushing-Radiohead-love camp.

Cyghfer,"['(READ WITH CAUTION, NOTE THE DATE~)\n\nDespite the drastic change in my listening habits during the past couple of years, I don\'t think I\'ll ever come to genuinely dislike this album; the nostalgia is just too strong. If I\'ve listened to an album in unusually excessive amounts I tend to associate that album with phases of mine, such as the phase when I was obsessed with a certain deceased online game called Wormhole. Familiar music carries strong visual and memorial connections and can eventually come to symbolize something I heavily associate with it. This album, OK Computer, carries the most memories and symbolizes the most things of any album I\'ve ever listened to.\n\nJust hearing Thom\'s voice lilt on Exit Music immediately summons up the darker, heartwrenching scenes of Fire Emblem (FE7 in Japan); The Tourist recalls the daily trips to and from dad\'s office building back in Michigan. I don\'t use quotation marks because these songs are so familiar and so vital to the memories of my early adolescence, and quote marks have a certain alienating (oh the irony) effect to them. I\'ll never forget the first time I heard the album: I was around 12, I think, and my sister was driving me around with her on errands. Wanting to infect me (a veritable pre-teen pleb who thought ""All Star"" was the greatest song ever) with some more ""sophisticated"" music she had recently discovered (a feat which she was ultimately more successful at I think than even she knows), she played this for me. I regarded it amicably and with curiosity; I rather liked the first two songs, loved the third one, especially for its cosmic guitar tone, didn\'t know what to think of the dark fourth one, and generally liked the rest of the songs I heard (marveling of course at that weird seventh one). She said the band, which had recently replaced The Atarees as her favorite band, was called Radiohead. That fact stayed in the back of my mind for the next couple of weeks.\n\nAfter that time that fact came out of hibernation and my curiosity sparked. I listened to the album again and it was pretty much instant love. The swooping guitars of Airbag; the general epicness of Paranoid Android; the jagged terror of Climbing Up the Walls; the singular album-closer feel of The Tourist, I bathed in the rapture and loved every second of it. Authentic aural ecstasy ensued in this manner for many months to come: I committed lyrics to rote memory, I hummed riffs and melodies during meals and I constantly revised my opinions of the best tracks. Nearly every track got a turn at best song, even Fitter Happier. It was the most anyone could ever expect from music.\n\nWhile I got into some other ""alternative"" stuff like The Flaming Lips and Belle & Sebastian, OK Computer remained my one true love. Of course, though, all good things come to an end. I eventually set the album aside in favor of some fresher tunes which I hadn\'t worn down to the bone, and I explored the rest of Radiohead\'s material. Then I moved from Michigan back to New York; an introspective and reserved kinda guy, I didn\'t make any real friends during the semester before the summer. During that summer I rejoined a Radiohead forum I had previously only casually browsed; my interest in music piqued, I started downloading everything in sight, and here I am now.\n\nIf I listened to this album for the first time today, I would probably think it a pretty good album, but quite undeserving of the heaps of praise (and pure hatred) thrown upon it. OK Computer occupies a singular place in the canon these days; it\'s probably the gateway album, the one-man transition from classic hard rock to indie and alternative music and culture in general. OK Computer is coming to be an essential white adolescent experience of vaunted proportions; if you haven\'t heard this record, whether you love it or despise it, you don\'t know anything about indie culture. My once pure view of this unique album is now tainted by the context of a broader knowledge of music and societal trends, and while I always enjoy listening to it, now it\'s simply that record, the one that measures musical naïveté. I truly wish this weren\'t the case, but knowledge corrupts. I still retain memories of those innocent times, though, and visual and mental cues of that phase pop up all the time. My experiences with OK Computer embody those of the complete journey from musical ignorance to avant-garde elitism (comically enough, I completely skipped over the comptemptible classic rock phase that so many youths go through and too many never leave. Thanks, Meghan). It was the first album I really connected with, and it still occupies a unique place in my collection. My love for the album, though now not nearly my favorite, is, in a sense, overflowing. I could never ask more from any piece of music.']",5.00 stars

dlo__olb,"['OK Computer, track-por-track:\n\n01 Airbag\nGran comienzo. ""Airbag"" es disonante, electrica, intensa, la más experimental del disco, que puede leerse como boton de muestra de las intensiones del grupo en OKC. Se abre el disco en grande. 5/5\n\n02 Paranoid Android\nDiez años escuchándola y, por desgracia, no sorprende como debería. La primera parte es excelente, siguiendo la linea de experimentos que venían anticipándose en ""Airbag""; la segunda parte destruye la melodía con el típico lado punketa que RH tiende a probar y que, en la mayoría de los casos, arruina sus canciones. La tercera parte, la fúnebre, es preciosa y vuelve al amor que había iniciado con la primera parte, siendo de nuevo desmontada al regresar esas guitarras.\n4.5 + 2.5 + 4 + 2.5 = 14.5/4 = 3.62 (3.5/5 por aproximación)\n\n03 Subterranean Homesick Alien\nEl lado más progresivo jamás mostrado por RH. Nada en verdad revelador. 3/5\n\n04 Exit Music (for a Film)\nOdio la música lastimera con descuadres épicos como el final de ésta. La peor del lote... El disco comienza a decaer... 1.5/5\n\n05 Let Down\nOtra lastimera, pero mucho más efectiva y preciosista. Además, tiene una letra sobervia. Su ""All Tomorrow\'s Parties"". 4/5\n\n06 Karma Police\nUun buen single. Todo está en su lugar: piano con reminicencias espectrales marca Beatles, quiebre ruidista sin sobreactuación y un Thom Yorke que sabe cantar con deje irónico su angustiosa persecusión. Escucharla en la radio no hace mal. 4/5\n\n07 Fitter Happier\nLa idea es buena (pasar la voz por un computador relatando la vida de cualquier ser alienado por el trabajo y la tecnología); su ejecución cumple. 3.5/5\n\n08 Electioneering\nParece que RH no quiere renunciar a la idea que ellos también pueden ""rockear"". No es su mejor faceta, pero acá suenan sorpresivamente ofuscados, lo que da mayor fuerza a un tema normalito. 3/5\n\n09 Climbing Up the Walls\nLas próximas tres canciones podrían justificar su status de ""clásico"". ""Climbing Up the Walls"" es un muro de guitarras como las ejecutadas por Mogwai en el mismo tiempo, suavizadas en un contexto más pop, lo que no las hace menos impactantes. La segunda cima. 4.5/5\n\n10 No Surprises\nEsta sí es una balada: un Thom Yorke más bien recitando que cantando, una melodía de xilófono, guitarra acústica y ""no alarms and no surprises"". 5/5\n\n11 Lucky\nLucky debe ser el ejemplo de una canción de transición, del ... al OKC. Une de gran forma ese espiritu del brit-pop más azucarado con el mantra espectral que cubre buena parte del disco. 4/5\n\n12 The Tourist\nEl cierre es otro acercamiento al rock progresivo (como ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"", su principal responsable es Jonny Greenwood). Su lentitud amortigua el climax emocional de los anteriores 3 temas, pero no deja esa angustia que permitiría regresar al disco. 3/5\n\n... y éso fue OK Computer a ojos y oídos de este servidor. Promedia 3.6, lo que por aproximación son tres estrellas y media. No niego que es un disco importante, pero diez años después me suena acomplejado, sin ese cinismo que hace atemporal otras obras maestras de la adolescencia británica como The Queen Is Dead o Different Class. En cambio, su sufrida mirada al mundo de 1997 lo hace un buen testimonio de su época, el mejor que podemos encontrar. Pero ello no es suficiente para convertir este disco en un clásico o un punto de quiebre en la música pop.']",3.50 stars
Iamthegamer,"['I don\'t think the world would ever be the same without OK Computer. It\'s been 10 years and a couple months change since Parlophone printed it and it\'s still the quintessential album of our times. That\'s more than a title to bestow upon some preposterously well liked form of entertainment; it\'s an anomaly. The Bends signaled a bright future, but not one that featured OK Computer, or any album as equally immense. Quite frankly, the album shouldn\'t exist. The record is just too epic. It\'s almost as if the course of history was changed when OK Computer dropped. Just about every album ever released suits the times they\'re created in; this record was so perfect, the times suited OK Computer.\n\nI know I\'m getting all ""myth maker"" on your ass, but what else can I say? This is it. The record to end all records in the 20th Century and begin all of the records in the 21st Century. Or something like that. To some people it was just a couple guys updating Pink Floyd for the Grunge generation. I prefer to call those people dumbasses.\n\nOkay, Pink Floyd is indeed a distant relative, I\'ll give those dumbasses that, but they\'re still no where near as immediate. The Bends comes closest and that\'s not even in the same universe. There really is nothing like it, prior to or since. Again, an anomaly. No other music album I\'ve heard represents so many feelings at the same time: fear, hope, despair, destruction, alienation, open air, claustrophobia, triumph, quietude, failure, anxiety, trepidation, uneasiness, contentment, nonchalance, harmony, peace, distortion...nothing can even capture 1/16th of its majesty. OK Computer is so isolated from everything else because it was made under isolation. Jonny Greenwood said it best:\n\n""the main difference in the atmosphere [from past albums] was in... the studio experience. We were all of the same age, mid- to late-twenties, and doing a record in the middle of nowhere. And there were no established professionals there. It wasn\'t a real recording studio, and we had our friend [Stanley Donwood] doing the artwork in the studio at the same time. We were all at the same stage of our life and all working together for something, it was quite a buzz.""\n\nRecording an album by yourself isn\'t a new concept, but in the right hands, it can create something entirely uncontaminated and virgin...which is pretty much what happened with OK Computer.\n\nIn case you were just born, you may be asking yourself what this record sounds like. Imagine if the happiest day of your life was the day you killed yourself. It\'s like opening Christmas presents during the Apocalypse. A spaceflight directly into the sun. Getting the best sleep of your life on top of the button that simultaneously launches all the nukes in the world. Driving your car into a pit of fire. OK Computer marries thrill and harrow, joy and death, ordinary and impossible, all that and more. To say the album is nothing short of magic would be hitting the nail on the head.\n\nNow, you don\'t have to love this album. You don\'t have to even like it. All preceding hyperbole is just how I see it. Hell, it\'s not even my favorite Radiohead album. The thing is, I believe that at some point in your life, you will love OK Computer. Your deathbed, 7th grade, a walk in the park, working at the same desk after 32 years, watching your two dogs fuck, doing your son\'s math homework, your sister\'s wedding reception, whatever the situation, sooner or later this album will get you. It\'s just too powerful to be ignored.\n\nI mean, this is it. Thom Yorke would never write better lyrics than he did here. Radiohead would never sound more natural than they did here. The pressure upon Radiohead would never be as assuring as it was frightening as it is here. Critical consensus on a Radiohead record would never be as definite as it is here. History probably couldn\'t be encapsulated on a record better than it is here. Be all, end all. This whole review is nothing new. What is there left to say anymore, really? It\'s almost as if OK Computer just left everyone imaginatively speechless.\n\nIt\'s been about 123 months since the world changed and the only constant is just how great this record is. Such a thing shouldn\'t be possible...\n\nBut if OK Computer is possible...\n\nWhat isn\'t?']",5.00 stars

progshine,"[""O Radiohead ou é amado ou odiado. Muitos o consideram a salavação da música inglesa dos anos 90, muitos os consideram uma\nbanda chata e pretensiosa. O que eu acho? Acho que é uma banda fantástica. Do começo melancólico e triste do primeiro disco a este grande disco, a banda sempre continuou inquieta e cheios de idéias, uma grande banda que merece sempre ser ouvida. É bom que façam um som assim em plenos 90/00.\n\n01. Airbag\nO clima é claustrofóbico. Aliás isso é sinônimo de Radiohead, mas ao mesmo tempo a melodia te pega pelo calcanhar e faz com\nque você fique de ouvidos atentos. Uma programação encobre de certa forma a bateria de Phil Selway, e a linha de baixo simples e perfeita de Colin Greenwood\nmandam na música, se bem que as duas guitarra da banda (Ed O'Brien e Johnny Greenwood) constroem sempre linhas\ndesconcertantes. Sem contar as linhas melódicas de Thom Yorke que tem um dos vocais mais legais de toda a década de 90, é a emoção na ponta da língua.\n\n02. Paranoid Android\nCaraca, se essa não é a música mais claustrofóbica, insana e que aperta o peito já escrita não é nada, do começo ao fim a\nsensação é quase indescrítivel, uma linha de violão estranhíssima, vocais, quebras por todos os lados. As guitarras sempre muito afiadas e cheia de 'dor'. Antes da doidera maior e peso uma linha de baixo muito boa, excelente! Então eis que surge um belo de um coral bizantino (risos, falando pelo fato de remeter a igreja, mas não tenho certeza se é mesmo).\n\n03. Subterranean Homesick Alien\nDe uma sutileza absurda! O nome me remeteu diretamente a Subterraneam Homesick Blues do Bob Dylan, mas o que ouvimos aqui é\numa melodia de tirar o fôlego. Daquelas que difícilmente a gente esquece tão cedo. Memorável!\n\n04. Exit Music (For A Film)\nMelancolia? Não! Isso é mais que melancólico! Se você tiver tendências suicidas passe longe (risos), é daquelas que se você\nnão toma cuidado te lava pra baixo também. Somente voz e violão e um teclados pra lá de macabro.\n\n05. Let Down\nEstranha combinação! Depois de uma faixa pra lá de down o que se ouve em Let Down (o nome encaixa) é uma canção\nquase-alegre, como seria uma canção quase alegre? Bem! Uma canção quase alegre é aquela que quase te deicxa alegre ué! Que\npergunta! Deixando as gracinhas de lado, o que temos por aqui são guitarras em linhas que estranhamente combinam entre si e uma base\nbem construída. E é sempre muito bom ouvir as linhas de baixo de Colin muito bem construídas na música da banda. Final esperto cheio de 'baruhos' e melodia.\n\n06. Karma Police\nIsso aqui é o máximo em angústia em formato musical, começando com o piano inicial, passando pelos vocais de Thom que sempre\nemanam algum tipo de sofrimento verdadeiro, de quem sente realmente o que está cantando, não são só palavras numa melodia. Pela primeira vez um teclado aparece de verdade e não faz feio, constrói uma melodia divina. Em clima apocalíptico terminamos.\n\n07. Fitter Happier\nIsso aqui é o cúmulo do experimentalismo. Você já viu aqueles programas de computador pra pessoas cegas que cada coisa que\nvocê escreve é repetida por uma voz robótica? Então, é disso que se trata. Ao fundo somente noise experience. Ouça e duvide.\n\n08. Electionnering\nRock And Roll Noise! Esse é o começo, uma melodia mais 'comum', o que não é muito comum no disco. Que vocalizações fodas ao fundo da música. Guitarras por toda a parte.\n\n09. Climbing Up The Walls\nO sentindo de subir as paredes aqui é colocado de forma mais que abstrata. Com percussão quase eletrônica, e vocal mal\ntratado. Só do meio pra frente que a música se torna mais 'humana', mas como a tônica do disco é a computadorização isso é um luxo. (risos)\n\n10. No Suprises\nMeu Deus que coisa linda! Do começo da guitarrinha imitando uma caixinha de música a melodia cheia de lirismo e lembranças. É um desafio escuitar sem se comover profundamente, os vocais de Yorke são emotivos até não poder mais. Sensacional, faz bem\naos sentidos.\n\n11. Lucky\nBaixo a frente, grave, guitarra acompanhando com dedilhados sensíveis. E não é que os caras são bons de refrão? Sempre refrões marcantes, com melodias pra lá de boas. Uma coisa rara nas bandas que são mais experimentais. Tem até uns lances meio jazz quase no final.\n\n12.

Axver,"['I hate to throw around the ""over-rated"" tag, but this album is definitely a contender for the dubious title of most over-rated album of all time. Frankly, it is mostly forgettable and unremarkable. Occasional moments of genuine musical creativity shine through, but as I said, they are occasional; there\'s a fine line between being really artistically creative and sticking a fork up your arse, twisting ten times, and claiming it\'s artsy, and Radiohead are familiar with crossing that line. Also, Thom Yorke\'s vocals are as dreadful as three cats being strangled. This is especially true for the slower songs, which he completely massacres.\n\nNow, I won\'t lie. Electioneering is a good song, and Karma Police and Paranoid Android both have a few things going for them. The rest should be consigned to the rubbish bin of history. It seems some pseudo-elitists act all superiorist about Radiohead and praise OK Computer like it\'s the first and second comings of Jesus combined; it\'s hilarious really, especially given all the amazing music out there that would be more deserving of such overly effusive praise.

NathFisher,"['Without a doubt, high on the list of albums that any serious music-lover needs in their collection. Almost from start to finish it\'s filled with beautiful, emotional songs with gorgeous arrangements.\n\nThe production is spot on: That is, you don\'t even notice it - you just hear the song. Opener ""Airbag"" is just one of the most perfect first tracks you could hope to hear. It\'s not the best on the album, but why would you want that? Surely a greater pleasure is to hear something damn good, then hear something infinitely better afterwards? The mixing of the tracks on OK Computer is sublime. It holds together beautifully as an album, and takes you on a journey filled with enigma. ""Airbag"" itself is but the first song on the journey. It\'s a song about a car crash which the singer survives, and is basically beautiful in a harsh way.\n\nThe album\'s undoubted highlight is ""Paranoid Android"". It\'s a ""Bohemian Rhapsody for the nineties with four parts, each seguing into the other perfectly. The acoustic part one sets a tired soul against the bustle of the world. ""Please could you stop the noise I\'m trying to get some rest/From all the unborn chicken voices in my head"".\n\nPart two introduces the best riff on the decade (yes, better than Teen Spirit...). It\'s menacing and thrilling, and after one listen creates an incredible surge of anticipation to hear it played loud and with O\' Brien\'s jerky, spastic touch after the line ""You don\'t remember, you don\'t remember"". Listened to loud, especially with headphones, I have to say this is possibly the greatest moment of music of the decade. Britpop? Pah. Thom Yorke deserves far more credit as a singer than he gets. Listen to his delivery of ""Off with his head man"". Ohhhh.\n\nPart three is subdued, almost operatic. ""Rain down, raaaiiin down, from a great height"" is the lyric to which Yorke applies his strained, nasal tones. The lyrical punch to the song is delivered in the least abstract of the verses in ""That\'s it sir, you\'re leaving/The crackle of pigskin/The dust and the screaming/The yuppies networking/The panic, the vomit/the panic, the vomit/God loves his children/God loves his children yeahhh"".\n\nAnd then here comes that riff again. The musicianship of the band is underrated: rarely has a group of musicians played music together and produced so incredible an effect, and certainly not since. The guitar solos at this final juncture of the song soundtrack perhaps the apocalypse. The album is honestly worth buying just for this single song alone. Listen to it loud with headphones, or whilst driving at night, and prepare to encounter a musical dimension you\'ve hitherto left undiscovered. Imagine Pink Floyd but a hell of a lot more aggressive and moving.\n\nNaturally, after the hysteria of ""Paranoid Android"", ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" is, in all honesty, a dissapointment. It takes a few moments to realise that this too is a great song, one about abduction. Spacey noises and another fine vocal performance lend this an other-worldly feel.\n\n""Exit Music"" is far too sad to listen to in a sane state of mind. Nevertheless, I, and we, do, and it just makes us sad. No one has the art of a sad song down to the nack of Thom Yorke and Co. The distorted bass towards the end takes it over the top of depression and the song lurches head-first into megalomaniac insanity.\n\n""Let Down"" is one of the best songs on the album, and that\'s really saying something. It\'s gentler and less directly-affecting than the other songs, and features a melancholy trot of a beat and, again, some gorgeous vocals. The lyrics are about city life, perhaps, the bustle of a metropolis, the unnaturalness (that took some spelling after a good few lagers) of man\'s mechanical dominion. This theme pervades through the album - or at least, the mechanical, unnatural aspect of human civilisation and it\'s depressing grayness. Like I say, I\'m WUI (writing under the influence, fool. Perhaps the best state to be in when typing about such an amazing record.). I\'m probably miles off. Luckily, Radiohead lyrics are open to interpretation for the most part.\n\n""Karma Police"" is great, but overplayed - at least by buskers in my local city. If you\'ve never heard it: Enjoy the magic for the first time! Then enjoy one of the album\'s two lowpoints! Yay! ""Fitter Happier"" is alright I guess, but a two minute \'song\' of Stephen Hawking vocals listing off various middle-class life occupations (like Trainspotting... Did anyone else find Ewan MacGregor\'s narration of stuff like ""Wide-screen televisions"" etc. a bit of a deflation after the glory of low-life depravation?) is not going to cut it on an album of otherwise genius quality.\n\nLuckily things are brought back to life with ""Electioneering"". The fury of ""Paranoid Android"" is resurrected, sadly though without the zap. It\'s still a good track though, and gives Thom a chance to vent his anger at plastic, two-faced politicians.\n\n""Climbing Up The Walls"" is \'creepy\' in song form. Let me say no more than that. ""No Surprises"" gets a little boring, but the first-time charm of the glockenspiel never gets tooold. The lyrics are nice too.\n\nNow. Had ""Lucky"" been the finale of OK Computer, it might have been the greatest album ever made. It\'s beautiful and epic. And after Thom sings ""We are standing on the edge"", you assume that\'s it, record over. And God! what a record. But unless you\'ve been watching the tracklisting on the back of the CD case (or following the lyrics booklet), it\'s a terrible surprise and shame to have to listen to ""The Tourist"" after the perfect end to the perfect Radiohead album. It\'s not a terrible song, it\'s just terribly placed. It\'s the second disappointment on OK Computer, and without it the album would have been a more incredible listen. It just doesn\'t end so dramatically with this tagged on the end like a lost child.\n\nAs such, the album gets four and a half stars. Out of five. It could have been so much better, Radiohead. But you\'re for now limited to the title of \'one of the damndest, bestest, most emotionally draining, incredible, beautiful, listenable, powerful, era-defining records ever recorded in the history of recording\'. Think what could have been.']",4.50 stars
ILY,"['OK Computer gave new meaning to the term hype. As soon as it was released, every publication hailed it as a masterpiece. Inevitably, the buying public soon followed. What is perplexing is that there ain\'t much difference between this and the previous The Bends. It\'s the same radio-friendly ""alternative"" ballads (just more intricately arranged), the same ""passionate"" stadium-rock overtones, the same hypocritical message (Radiohead, former middle-class students and current rock stars, criticizing modern society).\n\nOK Computer features two great songs (the disjointed ""Airbag"" and the hysteric prog ""Paranoid Android""), as well as a few interesting moments (the psych lounge ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"", the melodramatic buzz of ""Let Down"", the semi trip-hop ""Climbing Up The Walls""). On the other hand, ""Exit Music"", ""Karma Police"", ""No Surprises"", ""Lucky"" (with female backing vocals, reminiscent of mid 70s Floyd) and ""Tourist"" are soap operas, dramas for white collar workers, blockbusters for ""thinking"" people.\n\nAt least half of this album is songs we\'ve heard millions of times before, and occasionally too reminiscent of REM. Radiohead are the alternative-rock equivalent of Steven Spielberg. They produce ""thoughful"" albums, sometimes with faux experimental overtones, but when it comes down to it, they are sentimental trite. OK Computer is soft-rock disguised as art-rock, it\'s the Dark Side Of The Moon of the 90s.']",2.50 stars

kaasprodukte,"['What other album inspires so many unsubstantiated pointless reviews such as ‘simply the best album of the 90’s’ (full stop) or induces as many pretentious diatribes equating this album to the very essence of human existence?\n\nOne typically eloquent non RYM internet review cites:\n\nOk Computer creates a replication of my whole existence and fools my worries into thinking they are the real thing as they leave me for a façade.\n\nInstead of spending months picking the bones out of the above, why not find any number of the countless similar reviews whereby the listener has found exactly what the ‘meaning of life’ is via this album…there are literally 1000’s to be found by simply typing the\nwords prententious Radiohead reviews into google !!!\n\nThe funny thing about the reviews is that the writers have often simply ignored what the band has to say about the creative impetus behind the tracks. A couple of slides across a mouse mat will find numerous sites whereby direct quotes from the band explain the lyrics. For instance Airbag is ‘simply’ about the joy of avoiding a car crash and the resultant adrenaline rush, Karma Police is ‘simply’ about wishing ill fate on your ex-boss and the Bob Dylan rip off Subterranean Homesick Alien is ‘simply’ about an essay that Thom Yorke was asked to write at school…this is all in the bands words, who simply refused to offer any such overt pretentions and makes you wonder whether they have any rib cages left after they have finished their daily laughing spree about some of the meanings that those who are that way inclined impart upon this album.\n\nPerhaps such pretentious ‘meaning of existence interpretations’ come from the fact, that in this album Radiohead leave behind the guitar rock dominance of Pablo Honey and The Bends and experiment superbly with everything they can get their hands on. Weird keyboards, multi segmentations, computerised samplings, electronica and amazing time shifts are all wrapped up in their undoubted technical brilliance as true exponents of their craft. They find amazing ways to talk about the normal emotions in life which could (and are), in the wrong hands be interpreted incorrectly.\n\nPersonally I admire the album…but I admire it for what it actually is not for what it is isn’t. Perhaps this is my fault in life. To me an airbag is an airbag, a tosser of an ex boss is a tosser of an ex boss etc. Fortunately it appears the band think the same way. Unfortunately thousands of internet reviewers don’t.']",3.50 stars

I wouldn\'t patronise you by saying ""it\'s not you, it\'s me"" if I could help it, but that\'s the truth - it was just time to move on. I know what you think of her: she\'s vacuous, distant, pretentious. Heh, but don\'t you remember when people thought that about you? Come on, how many sections are there in Paranoid Android? Hmm? Too many for a lot of people. Except now they\'ve initiated you into the Rock Canon haven\'t they? Yeah, they say you\'re ""up there"" with the best of them. I think we both know you\'re not that kind of record really, not deep down, you\'re no ""classic rock"" album.\n\nOh sure, they made you while listening to Led Zep and The Beatles, but you\'re one of US really. You know you are. You\'re too passionate - I still think Let Down is one of the most beautiful songs ever, I really do, and Exit Music... well, I don\'t need to tell you that it\'s the saddest piece of music I\'ve ever heard. And then there\'s Climbing Up The Walls, of course, which really is as terrifying as it was intended to be. I thought you were perfect, y\'know. I really did.

I guess what I\'m trying to say is that I never stopped loving you.\n\nI know I\'ve grown a lot since I was with you - I listen to all kinds of things I never thought I\'d like, everything from hardcore to ambient music.

Radiohead are not pointed, sensitive critics of the post-modern military industrial complex or the alienation caused by modern technology. They are pampered Mummy\'s Boys from the mean ghetto streets of Oxfordshire who realised early that some girls dig it when boys look moody and have based their career and music on that fact. It boils down to a simple equation- music-soul+pretension=Radiohead\n\nHaving said this I like their basslines. No complaint at all about the bass player.\nThe purpose of the glorious genre we call rock music is not to articulate self-indulgent misery or indeed to save the whale. Radiohead attempt to do both without even thinking up a tune.\nThe idea, if you are writing songs from the dark side, is to articulate pain. Genuine sincere pain. Or if you are writing about politics blinding anger.This cannot be done when you are concerned about karma police infecting your brain. Still less when your imagery is so elliptical you could be singing about literally nothing. It was once said of Paul Simon that if some girl hadn\'t have treated him so bad in High School we would have missed out on all those marvelous songs.

The perfect mix of pop/rock and electronica. A concept album about the perils of technology, _O.K.

This album really shines on tracks from the opener ""Airbag"" to the closing epic ""The Tourist"". An album such as this will never be duplicated or eclipsed. Not even by Radiohead themselves. This album is better left unchallenged. Released only five years ago in 1997, it has already made its mark in music history as possibly the greatest rock album of the modern pop era.

There are many legitimate arguments that could be made for this not being the #1 album of all time. It wasn\'t as culturally influential as Sgt Pepper\'s, it didn\'t spawn an entire genre like ITCOTCK, it didn\'t push the musical envelope like Velvet Underground & Niko and didn\'t push the lyrical envelope like Highway 61 Revisited.\n\nWhat it did do, however, was combine influences from all these albums and more to make one of the most ""complete"" sounding albums ever created. What I mean by that is that each song works incredibly well both on its own and in context. Each song instantly drags you into its own confusing, schizophrenic, sometimes melancholy and mournful world and never lets go, yet when it\'s all over you can look back at the whole album and easily see where all the pieces fit, so to speak.\n\nSo no, Radiohead aren\'t even close to being the most innovative rock group of all time, but I will argue that they are simply one of the best. OK Computer is the culmination of everything they had ever been working toward, and it has affected me and many other Gen X/Gen Y\'ers so profoundly that it\'s really no surprise that it is #1.\n\nI don\'t think it\'s flawless, though.

It\'s because they\'ve stopped trying so hard to be a *guitar band* and instead are shooting for commercial suicide (at least Capitol thought as much when Radiohead delivered the final product to them). Honestly, the music is still pretty firmly grounded in 90\'s alternative rock, it\'s just that now they\'re more interested in electric pianos, echo-y drum kits, loops, samples, crescendoing (aka starting a song minimally and then slowly building it up), and piecing different sections together to make longer, weirder songs.\n\nThe old style is still around on exactly ONE song: the straight-up rocker ""Electioneering,"" which usually gets singled out as being the weak link but I like it just fine, in fact if any Radiohead song could be called \'underrated\' it would be this one. The other sore thumb is of course ""Fitter Happier"", two minutes of a computerized voice saying stupid shit like ""on Sundays ring road supermarket"" and ""car wash"" and yes, this _is_ as pointless as everyone thinks it is.\n\nNearly every other song though, good or bad (and they\'re mostly all good), contains at least a few elements that Radiohead haven\'t tried before. For example, If ""Airbag"" sounds a little weird or off, it\'s because that drum take isn\'t actually being played, it\'s 5 seconds or so of a Phil Selway sample being looped. If ""Climbing Up the Walls"" sounds weird too, it\'s probably because the string section, handled entirely by Jonny Greenwood, features 16 different violins playing quarter tones apart from each other. I can\'t say that every decision works to their advantage - ""The Tourist"" is shooting for a super spacey sound but unfortunately not much happens during its 5 minutes. And even though I like the song, ""Karma Police"" is one of the more blatant rip-offs of another song I\'ve heard (""Sexy Sadie"" by the Beatles). On a different note, Thom is starting to develop that over-emoting style of his, moaning and drawing out every syllable over two or three bars longer than he needs to, and I\'m basically indifferent here, I don\'t _dislike_ the tone of his voice but his vocals will start to grate on me if the music\'s boring.

Gone are the personal lyrics and pop song structures, arriving are the multi-sectional pieces with a wide variety of instruments (piano, strings, mellotron, and more) and encompassing lyrics of death, alienation, and the dullness of everyday life. The biggest difference between Pablo Honey and The Bends is the quality of the songwriting, but the biggest difference between The Bends and OK Computer is undoubtedly the scope. Most important to that scope is the sequencing of the album, with Airbag and Lucky being the first and penultimate tracks, respectively; both songs tell the story of a man who survived a vehicular accident and provide a sense of the importance of life, which all the songs in between focus on in different ways, be it overreaction and happy-go-lucky people who don\'t give enough thought to their action (Paranoid Android), alienation (Subterranean Homesick Alien), or dissatisfaction with a maladroit life (No Surprises). Only the albums closer ""The Tourist"" breaks away from the theme, and Yorke takes a trip back to The Bends and begins talking to himself, telling himself to slow down, a glimpse of what was to come with Kid A.\n\n""Paranoid Android"" is a three-section song influenced by ""Happiness Is A Warm Gun"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" ""Karma Police"" is split into two sections and uses repetition without a chorus. ""Fitter Happier"" is a monotonous reading from a computer about a perfect figure, which turns out to be a lab animal. Climbing Up The Walls is driven by a large string section and bug sounds. OK Computer isn\'t just one of the most ambitious albums ever, it\'s one of the most needlessly ambitious albums ever. The Bends was a fantastic album that once again redefined what pop songwriting was capable of, arguably the The Joshua Tree or The Queen Is Dead of its decade, in that regard. But the band wasn\'t satisfied with just a pop album, and so they gave us something completely different that maintained the quality of songwriting. While The Bends utilizes similar styles on each song and relies heavily on distinct riffs, melodies, and rhythm lines to differentiate songs, OK Computer relies on different instruments and changes to the key and time signatures. Only ""Electioneering"" seems to be unable to find its own identity in Radiohead\'s catalog, but that only means it\'s unique to the album, and the song is more than good enough to have been on The Bends had it been written already. Aside from the Hubble, OK Computer might have the largest scope of anything we can experience.\n\nSo, is OK Computer perfect? Far from it. Despite the ambition of the lyrics, they often fall short in successfully penetrating the listener\'s hearts. The great thing about personal lyrics is that humans, for the most part, have the same emotions, and someone can relate to a piece of art written in that state of mind. The Bends is far from a lyrical masterpiece, but it\'s extremely easy to relate to. Social commentary, on the other hand, has to be articulate and find a way to give its message through a personal issue. ""And if my thought-dreams could be seen/they\'d probably put my head in a guillotine/but it\'s alright ma, it\'s life and life only."" Not everyone (in fact, not anyone) can be Bob Dylan, but for such a scope he should at least be able to give us an ""I don\'t want to take what you can give/I would rather starve than eat your bread/All the things that others want for me/Can\'t buy what I want because it\'s free."" Yorke\'s lyrics are occasionally haunting (Climbing Up The Wall), but more often too abstract to really be effective (Paranoid Android, Karma Police). Furthermore, no song is able to match the best on The Bends, which in and of itself isn\'t a bad thing because of the strength of its songs, but the reason is indeed a problem for the album. Radiohead was so focused on unique sounds from song to song that they never seemed to have created the best song they could in any style they attempted. If they wanted a certain atmosphere to carry through the album they would only truly go for it a couple times, and if Pablo Honey taught us anything, it\'s that Radiohead needs practices to master their technique. OK Computer never gave itself that chance, and the subsequent Kid A is too busy trying to do its own thing to cash in on all the great things that this still magnificent album gives us. For all its flaws, OK Computer is still a great album, and it only seems to get stronger and stronger as you know the songs better. The surprise and excitement of hearing a new style the first couple times is eventually overtaken for the desire to understand just why a song is so different, and that is when OK Computer really shines. When you can listen to an album and then not realize how much there is to it until you start to break it down with words, you know you\'ve got yourself an album, and it\'s probably better than you thought it was when you heard it. Why not give it a try? Spin OK Computer, write about it, and spin it again.\n\nRating: 4.25/5 (Yeah, I went there)\nBSFTA: Let Down, Electioneering']",5.00 stars

Odd_even,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Once you surrender your ears to the jangle of Greenwood\'s guitar, O\'Brian\'s controlled rhythm, Greenwood\'s tamed bass, Selway\'s multi-dimensional drums and the chime of Yorke\'s voice, you find yourself on a journey through dimensions of melancholic beauty. Mesmerizing galaxies spin around your head as you sway through the space dust. You know your body is secured on the face of the earth, however your mind is racing away through colourful atmospheres. Some radiate bright colours, making you feel joyous. Others dimmer darkly, making you ponder on some elements of life, such as social disconnection and the importance of empathy. Sailing through this metamorphosing realm for 53 minutes and 27 seconds, I gurantee if you approached this album with clarity in mind, you will find a sort sonic Nirvana, if you will, within the immeasurable depths this album scales. For what Radiohead conceived here, is a genuine masterpiece. An assorted collection of utter audio delights. The spacious spheres of ""Airbag"" seeps into the multi-dimensional ""Paranoid Android"", a masterpiece, controlling the time shifts majestically while unleashing the tension it had brewed so perfectly, before floating back down to sanity. This, and the successor, the peaceful and disconnected ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" only paint a portion of a portrait of the sheer tapestry Radiohead crafted. ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" delivers Yorke at his most vocally haunting, while ""Let Down"" is a downright downhearted anecdote only perked up by those tremendously furbished, solemn guitar notes. ""Karma Police"" is perhaps the most accessible song on the album, a fairly straightforward piano-driven art piece which lends a leg of melody to ""Sexy Sadie"". Nonetheless, it is, by all means, a perfect art rock song, a defining article of the genre. Poetic and quirky lyrics, a definitive melody, this song alone has inspired plenty of acts over the past decade.\n\n""Fitter Happier"" is the interlude of the whole ok computer scheme, the fabricated intelligence of the song failing to deliver emotional drive whatsoever, crashing and crumbling down upon itself as we acknowledge the definitive distinction between machine and man is defined via emotion. ""Electioneering"" nods at The Bends-era Radiohead, the tune crashing it\'s way through political concourse before collapsing at the feet of the eerie and unsettling ""Climbing Up the Walls"", perhaps the only song to rival ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" as the most haunting tune on the track. It\'s a twisting tail of paranoia that simply self-destructs at 3:07 into a distorted synthetic oblivion. And then this bleeds into the absolutely beautiful OK Computer trilogy, which proceeds with ""No Surprises""; just a sad, downward spiral through ambient notes pampering us softly as we descend down the avenue of pessimistic despair. It\'s one of the most effulgent articles of emotion stirring music recorded, the gentle keys capturing melancholy in its finest sonic disguise. The equally fantastic ""Lucky"" was the first Radiohead song that really grabbed my attention all those years back, and it was also surprisingly one of the first songs the band recorded with Nigel Godrich, who would become their chief producer. It\'s a brilliant melody that slowly builds, fulfilling Yorke\'s protagonist with an invaluable abundance of optimism, hauling himself out of the wreckage that could be interpreted as a number of things, from the obvious physical object to life.\n\nAnd sadly we approach the final destination on the musical voyage, the sympathetic harmony of ""The Tourist"" slowly absorbing us into its spiralling sphere, encapsulating every last breathe of bitter-sweet elements the album had to offer, constructing a spiral staircase which will guide us gentle out of the album, and kiss us with a delicate \'ping\' before evaporating into thin air.\n\nTo be honest it\'s quite hard to describe the album. My words alone cannot quite reflect what a dramatic influence this album has had upon the development of me as a person and as a music fanatic. Hopefully one day these words will come to me; a day I can pronounce myself as God, perhaps.\n\nKEY TRACK(S): Airbag, Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music (For a Film), Let Down, Karma Police, Climbing Up the Walls, No Surprises, Lucky, The Tourist\nOverall: 96.3636%\nTherefore: 5/5']",5.00 stars

In fact, it\'s downright depressing. But it\'s a wonderfully crafted release. Every song has a place on my MP3 player (except for maybe ""Fitter Happier""). The specific highlights include ""Paranoid Android"", a great sprawling epic made of many parts, ""Electioneering"", an absolutely furious rant on who-knows-what (Thom\'s vocals are impossible to understand), and the terrifying ""Climbing Up the Walls"" (you can\'t understand Thom on this one either; this would soon become normal on Radiohead records). ""Airbag"" is a layered, sonically neat track, and is the happiest song on the album (funny, it\'s about narrowly avoiding a car crash). ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is dramatic and intense, and ""The Tourist"" sounds like Pink Floyd in their heyday, and is a great closer to a great album.

Foreboding lyrics such as ""Ambition makes you look very ugly"" and ""When I am king you\'ll be the first against the wall"" litter the entire track, and it inspires thought and provokes startling images not yet found in other music I\'ve heard. And then in the middle of this grand, majestic, devious song the band explodes in a barrage of anger and aggression. Fast guitar rifts and tumbling drums utterly come out of nowhere and sweep the listener away.\nThe song goes on for quite a long time, almost 7 minutes in fact, but it feels like seconds, and you\'ll probably end up listing to it over and over again.\n\n""Paranoid Android"" and ""Airbag"" aren\'t the only two tracks that make OK Computer such a fun album to listen to, far from it in fact. .\n\nSubterranean Homesick Alien is a bizarre and very quirky song with echoing guitar rifts and odd keyboard playing that makes this song tend to stand more on the lighter side for the entire CD.\n\n""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is a deeply moving slow and acoustic track that finishes off with an electronic guitar that seems to glow with self-contempt and anger.\n\n""Let Down"" is a medium paced and pleasant song that has superb lyrics and ingenious use of keyboards.\n\n""Karma Police"" a song very much influenced by the Beatles ""Sexy Sadie and the ending of this track sounds a lot like the Beatles ""Flying"".\n""Fitter Happier"" is a computerized voice and assortment of electronic sounds coming together in narrative that speaks of the perfect era of life and the lack of imperfection that comes with it. Truly it is the social core of OK Computer that speaks of the flaws that come with government control over humanity. The rest of the tracks are in their own rights, amazing, and probably some of the best songs I\'ve heard in my entire life, or will ever hear for that matter.

With its strange production effects and complex arrangements, this song works as a perfect opener for the album.\nAfter the car crash survival of ""Airbag"" we get to hear one of the album\'s most epic songs, the humorous ""Paranoid Android,"" probably also the only song that has lyrics that seem pretty random and not about much (yet still used in a way that you can say the lyrics are good - that\'s what a genius Thom Yorke is). The song itself starts of with a groovy beat that leads into ferocious guitar duels between Jonny Greenwood and Ed O\'Brian and a slow second half with vocals overlapping one another until another smash of guitar solos ends the track - amazing.\nThen comes the aquatic-sounding ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" about alien abduction, with a jazzy verse and beautiful chorus.\n""Exit Music (for a film)"" comes next. A story about two lovers escaping from a over-protective father (based upon Romeo and Juliet) this song is slow, and some say it\'s depressing, but I find it\'s morbid undertones actually quite beautiful. When Thom begs his lover to ""breathe, keep breathing"" while an electronic choir sings in the background it sends shivers down my surprise.\nIt took me a while to like the next track, ""Let Down,"" but both the lyrics and the chorus are quite beautiful, and at the end there\'re several vocals overlapping at once with all the instruments going as well, showing a clear example of just how complex Radiohead can make their music.\n""Karma Police"" at first seems like quite a humorous song with it\'s slow but catchy chorus, but the second half of the song is beautiful, and Jonny\'s piano playing sounds great.\n""Fitter Happier"" is basically an interval, although the instruments behind the robotic voice sound nice, if a little depressing.\n""Electioneering"" is a more conventional rock song with a good chorus and a great guitar solo at the end.\n""Climbing up the Walls"" is dark and eerie, with rising strings and a horn solo.\n""No Surprises"" is a nice nursery rhyme-type song with poetic lyrics and a pleasant instrumental section.\n""Lucky"" is a brilliant song with the chorus a beautiful cry for help from Yorke, with superb guitar playing from Jonny. This kind of seems like Radiohead\'s ""Comfortably Numb,"" if you ask me.\nThe albums outro, ""The Tourist"" is considered by many not as good as the rest of the album. Admittedly, it\'s nowhere near as complex or as compressed, but I actually quite like the way it\'s open and spaced out. It\'s like you\'ve been compressed and isolated throughout the album and at the end it\'s letting you out with a nice easy song to listen to.\nOverall, _Ok Computer_ is, in my opinion, Radiohead at their very best and finest moment. Consistent throughout, it\'s a dreamy and fantastic soundscape of wonderful music, and I would certainly recommend it to those who haven\'t heard it yet.']",5.00 stars
Daisy13,"['Back in 1997 I had heard so much about Radiohead, that I needed to see what all the hype was about. All I knew about them was the song ""Creep"", cause everyone knew it. I had _The Bends_ , but somehow I never got around to listening to it, and I kind of forgot I even owned it.\nI was really interested in listening to _OK Compyter_ so when I bought it and got in my car, I listened to the CD immediately, curiosity had gotten the best of me. I immediately understood that this album was exceptional. I consider myself a person with very good taste in music. I appreciate many different kinds of music ranging anywhere from classical to rap to nu-metal to eastern music, (except country music.) When I listened to this album for the first time, I felt like I had to listen to it over and over.\nAfter listening to this album several times, I listened to _The Bends_ and immediately saw their seemingly natural progression to _OK Computer_. _The Bends_ is a very, very GOOD album, but it is of the same type of guitar music that was popular at the time i.e. Oasis, Blur, Smashing Pumpkins. _OK Computer_ takes _The Bends_, and mellows it out with sweeping guitars, and oftentimes dreamy melodies. Add electronica, mixed with Thom Yorke\'s (passionate) vocals and you get somewhat of an idea of what this album is about.\nI realize that there are people out there who dislike Radiohead, and that is OK. I am not trying to convert anyone to be their fan. But, I really do think that this album is sophisticated and ground-breaking and deserves a chance to be listened to.\n\nMy personal opinion of Radiohead:\nThe Beatles experimented with music and the world got brilliance. Radiohead as a band do not follow and create top 40 ""type"" of music. Radiohead do choose to grow and move into different directions, and with each album, they definitely accomplish that. Many bands and musicians follow and create the same type of music in their time period, and that music is OK for many people, yet few choose to make their own path, because it might mean less popularity, less sales, etc.. and therefore these ""period"" bands go with what is tried and true. They are the bands that release album after album of the same type of music. Never evolving, often stagnant.\n\nI think this band will be remembered for their originality, and although maybe not extremely popular (meaning on the radio) in our day and age, they will have opened the door for a new music yet to come.']",5.00 stars
bluehawaiian,"['After the critical acclaim of Radiohead’s previous masterpiece, “The Bends” from 1995, there was a lot of pressure for them to deliver the goods for a second time in a row. While most critics were probably expecting the band to produce a good album, I’m sure the majority didn’t expect it to be as good as it turned out.\n\nThe first hints as to what the album might sound like came from the first single and second track on the album- the six and a half minute “Paranoid Android”- an amazing series of ideas ranging from percussive, melancholic quiet sections to extremely loud Pixies style guitar work. I feel it is undoubtedly the album’s true highlight.\n\nWith the exception of “…Android” and the angry, political “Electioneering” (influenced by Elvis Costello and featuring more jagged guitar playing), the album falls into three sections- slow, majestic ballads, melancholy acoustic laments and more experimental, electronic tracks.\n\nOpener “Airbag” is probably the most successful of the more experimental songs- its strange, cut up drum patterns and flanged guitars evoking technological breakdown. Track nine, “Climbing Up The Walls” is another strange song, featuring a radio being tuned in the background against a menacing synth bass line and gently strummed guitars.\n\nThe two acoustic based songs on offer are immensely poignant- especially “Exit Music (For A Film)” which was influenced by Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. It builds to an immensely powerful climax featuring fuzz bass and a raw drumbeat, which never fails to send a chill down the spine whenever it is played.\n\nThe majority of the album, however, is taken up by a series of amazing, majestic ballads. The most effective of these in my opinion are the Smiths inspired “Let Down” and the epic closer, “The Tourist”. On both of these tracks, the guitars chime beautifully and the choruses brim with emotion. Many have imitated this kind of song writing but none have managed to produce better music than these particular tracks in my opinion.\n\nThe album closes beautifully with a trio of amazing songs- “No Surprises”, “Lucky” and the aforementioned “The Tourist”. The chime of a triangle at the very end of this last track was the perfect way to end Radiohead’s peak album.']",5.00 stars

Skarlet,"[""In my opinion the true test of great music is time. Some albums are great because they capture a certain age, but then the listener in decades to come may find it hard to relate to the lyrics and feel. OK Computer is special because it certainly does capture an age, but I feel listeners in years to come will still be able to listen and understand the message. This is because OK Computer is about a situation and depression in our world that is worsening daily and will continue to do so with the development of machine by man. OK Computer describes a world has no faith in God or others, where humankind is speedily evolving into a heartless, computer-brained, technology-governed society. The songs describe aliens, plane crashes, a young boy rescuing his love from her cruel father's fortress, haunting by demons, robots- imagine Star Wars with a beautiful script (it's hard to I know). This album at first seems like the biggest downer, however once you start listening to the lyrics it becomes something more.

There is no way somebody else\'s opinion on an album is the exact same as yours thought for thought. This album just demonstrates what I hate about alternative rock. Songs like ""Airbag"", ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Climbing Up the Walls"" are slow to get through and didn\'t do anything for me. The production is the biggest problem here as it dates the album, and specifically dates it to a period in music where I just feel like there wasn\'t much of anything good. Whoever their vocalist is he just isn\'t cutting it and his voice sounds annoying to me. The drum sound is annoying, and they keyboards don\'t do anything interesting to me. The guitar is interesting at certain parts though. It\'s not like I didn\'t like anything.

Me apetece bastante, álbuns que têm uma ambientação linear, quase como se tivesse sido criada uma ""atmosfera temática"" onde o álbum flui e soa como uma única música, obviamente bem variada mas sem perder o foco imposto nessa ""atmosfera temática"".

LCBebop,"['AOTD: Radiohead ~ OK Computer (1997)\n\nI guess it’s time to review this bad boy. “Airbag” is already starting off strong. The drums sound steady and heavy, and I like the tempo of them. It’s an interesting song indeed and genuinely had the gears in my head turning. That final stretch sounds like Boards of Canada’s Geogaddi, ngl. “Paranoid Android” has a lot of interesting sounds to bring to the table. Really love this one, perhaps more than “Airbag.” I didn’t expect to like this album this much at first listen, but here we are. I love experimental music when done right. This is groundbreaking. What a song that is “Subterranean Homesick Alien.” With a chill and atmospheric intro, it transitions almost perfectly into a conglomeration of just anxiety if turned into music. The only thing I kinda have an issue with is Thom Yorke’s vocals can be kinda off at times. After 2 songs dragged on, here we are with “Karma Police.” Quite the song. I like this one a lot. Especially the piano and the drums. Definitely a highlight of the album. Again, his vocals just make me uncomfortable lol, but they’re not terrible. Sometimes he sounds good. “Electioneering” is a good change of pace from whatever the hell “Fitter Happier” was lmfaoooo. Upbeat and heavy, I like it. I can see myself playing this banger again in the future. Yet again getting some Boards of Canada’s Geogaddi vibes on “Climbing Up the Walls.” One of the best on the album.

Furthermore, although my praise for this album may not be on par with the rave reviews that it has received both in the past as well as retrospectively, I can see why it is put in such high regard. One of its strongest aspects is indisputably the concept - that being alienation as a consequence of society becoming more dependent on technology as time progresses, causing deterioration amongst humans in areas such as spontaneity and social well-being. As a matter of fact, OK Computer executes the concept so accurately that it feels as, if not more, relevant today than it did 25 years ago. Additionally, when you consider our current situation with COVID-19 and the lockdowns that followed, it is rather stunning how perfectly this album conveys the emotional intensity of isolation.

kxngE,"['Introduction:\nRadiohead is quite possibly the greatest alt-rock group to ever exist. Not only did their albums age very well but the production on their albums have remained very complex and precise. This album specifically discusses the ""now-common"" topic, the disadvantages of technology. And it does a good job at pointing out ironies of technology itself. The album fuses progressive rock and electronic rock to create a very unique side of ""Alternative Rock"". Radiohead already established themselves through the massively successful single, ""Creep"". Ironically, the record companies thought that OK Computer would be commercial suicide for the band but it happened to be the opposite.\n\nReview:\nThe album, ""OK Computer"" has lyrics that have aged very well. OKC is one of the most ambitious records provided by the band. The ""Winter/Christmas"" type production on Airbag already sets in a rhythmic/spooky mood for the listener. The song points out an irony. The song is about Thom\'s car accident and how an airbag saved his life. Pretty ironic how technology can kill us and save us at the same time. Radiohead follows up the album with a more post-progressive rock song titled ""Paranoid Android"". The vocals are very laid back and soothing, which could be compared to Spellling\'s recent record, ""The Turning Wheel"". Yorke’s lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilt a drink on her. I love the acoustic guitar in the background syncing in with the bass and the electronic/synthesized guitar. In “Subterranean Homesick Alien,” Thom speaks of being isolated or different from the rest of his brethren. He wishes an alien colony can take him away just so he could be a silent observer instead of an active participant in this unfair game we call life. The concept is pretty relatable given the current status of our world(The global pandemic), just bringing in a whole new unintended interpretation to the song. The ""Winter"" type experimental production continues with the drums fusing in with synthesized bass guitars. The vocals are pretty much similar throughout the entire record, possibly the only repeated aspect of the album. After watching a movie, Radiohead was very inspired to work on the track. The result was “Exit Music (For A Film)”, a chillingly gentle song that bursts into a haunting crescendo of emotion. Appropriately, the track was used as a closing credit to the film they watched. I love the little alienated harmonisation created by the synthesizers and the amazing background drums. The next track on the album continues the pattern of electronic/progressive rock fusion. The song structure features multi-layered arpeggiated guitars and electric piano, with unconventional time signatures and a Spector-Esque “Wall of Sound”. I love the gibberish vocals halfway through the track. Well, not really gibberish, but pretty undisputed vocal ranges were used, which came off as a good aspect. ""Karma Police"", possibly the greatest hit from the album had a laid back piano recursion. The drums are a tad bit generic and the track mixing is pretty generic too, compared to the rest of the album(very experimental album), it falls short in terms of originality. ""Karma Police” is a haunting and atmospheric track. Thom Yorke’s strained, lackadaisical vocals are at once warm and sinister, echoing the delusions of an addict in the midst of a narcotic meltdown. Musically, the band follows a creamy, dreamlike chord progression that makes use of an old Beatles melody, laid out on the piano to create a velvety bed of uneasy comfort. ""Fitter Happier"" is a track predicting the future of technological exploitation. Fitter Happier is a list of bullet points that diagnosed society for what it was, and where it was headed at the time of this song’s release and arguably the world we live in now. The synthesized piano chords create such a horrifying atmosphere. I honestly got scared when listening to this song considering the very unexpected vocal frequencies and the dark turn on the instruments. ""Electioneering"" is a more upbeat ""Green day"" type song. The song made me nod my head for four minutes straight. I love the hard usage of the electric guitar and the drum snares. One of the most replayed tracks from the album, in my opinion. Sung from the perspective of paranoid fear itself, “Climbing Up the Walls” takes the English idiomatic expression for utter unpleasant feelings, such as worry and doubt giving the expression a voice. I would define this song as ""Scary"" just like the band did. The hard-hitting drum productions supported by Birds chirping create a very good opening atmosphere, then the track is followed up with eerie/ambient sounds. I love how the production, vocal samples, and instruments are all connected with each other. ""No Surprises"" seems to talk about the initial burnout an artist faces while making music. The song uses a slowed down xylophone with peaceful, yet generic drum notes. The song is way more tolerable for a newer Radiohead fan, maybe this is the reason why this track is the last single from the album. Reflecting on the first track, ""Lucky"" compliments ""Airbag"" as Thom finds himself in a position where he is yet to discuss his deepest fear, long-distance travelling. The choir type chorus is so damn peaceful and soothing. I love the instruments on this song too. The 12th and the final track on the album, ""The tourist"", ends off with a peaceful essence. Punctuating the album with soaring guitar solos and ethereal vocals. The track is about enjoying life; when a tourist visits a place, he usually feels like he has to do a lot to take in the sights, making him move at a fast pace, hence Thom telling him to “slow down"".\n\nTrack by Track Review:\nAirbag: 10/10\nParanoid Android: 10/10\nSubterranean homesick alien: 9.5/10\nExit Music(For a Film): 10/10\nLet Down: 9/10\nKarma Police: 10/10\nFitter Happier: 7/10\nElectioneering: 10/10\nClimbing up The walls: 9/10\nNo Surprises: 9.5/10\nLucky: 10/10\nThe Tourist: 10/10\nOverall Rating(Approximately): 114/120 OR 95%\n\nConclusion:\nThis album marks a very important lesson for record companies.

EnnuiOnMe,"['OK Computer is a masterpiece. That much is, I feel, not up to debate. If a piece of art maintains such a firm hold on its cultural zeitgeist, holding a legacy as an embodiment and a pinnacle of a particular moment, then there is no other word for it. The ultimate impossibility of OK Computer, however, is separating it from that moment. It is not a living work; it is a relic, a point in time where pop culture was on the precipice of a shift. The epistemic value of the album as an art form, in fact every structure of our lives, was up in the air as the digital age loomed over us, building a tension for the oncoming antisocial singularity of at-home consumerism and distance as the norm. OK Computer’s cover art, its photo negative cityscape with dapples of pop art, depicts the new world’s “life out of balance,” the Reggio-esque blurred out dirge of modernity now pictured as distinctly unnatural, anti-natural in form. Radiohead’s vision of the world is one only possible in the age of the personal computer and the dissociations which come through an irreversibly interconnected world. Just as life in the coming millennium, the photograph is a blurred swirl of light disjointed from its meaning.\n\nAnd so it is for the album proper. Nowhere is this dystopian perspective more obvious than “Fitter Happier,” my personal favorite track on OK Computer. It is here that the band properly embrace synthetic sounds, enclosing the piece in atmospheric waves of droning noise while a somber piano piece seeps through its layers of distortion. Against it is a collection of sampled dialogue, too quiet to make out, while in the foreground you hear a text-to-speech poetry reading of the best words Yorke has ever written. It’s a series of fragments, a narrative generated from their connection; the piece is written as a free association of points with the line drawn in its execution, portraying the ideal life of a modern citizen, key words “more productive.” It is a life with the edges sanded off, falling into a dull middle ground — enjoy a drink “now and then,” “slower and more calculated,” “a pig in a cage on antibiotics.” The power that this capitalist ideal has is one of ideological influence, the structure of life itself serving as a pedagogy for the production of good workers, obedient and fallow. It worms the imperfections into one’s subconscious while we create an image of normalcy for ourselves, cogs which collapse slowly inward. The flashes of violence in the imagery, providing descriptions of cruelty to animals as broken, repressed urges, ones which only exist in the back of the mind and can never be expressed or dealt with for fear of the consequences which result of being marked as an outsider. The song points outward and inward, its threadbare imagery serving to illuminate a societal, authoritative web of ideology.\n\nThis is generally the mode which makes Radiohead perform at their best; abstraction with a clear direction. There is a clear sense of sonic worldbuilding in something like “Fitter Happier,” something which translates to the more rock-oriented sound of “Airbag,” which truly sounds like the album’s cover art. The guitar melody which introduces it feels almost like pure melody, an indescribably fluid sound which provides something of an opening theme for the album. It fully captures what the album sets out to do, which is examine and represent a world of evanescent glimmers of life. “Airbag” is the sound of a breath, building to a climax of a quietus which introduces Radiohead’s growing cultural vocabulary, taking the alt rock style they honed on The Bends and expanding it out to tinges of progressive rock and trip hop. It moves them into a new space which generally feels more exhilarating and modern. Its sterility is backed up through an emotional range which was not present on the first two albums, which makes the highpoints more effective.\n\nThe problems come when the group shy away from that atmosphere, opting for more hooky, energetic music. “Electioneering” is, frankly, the worst song Radiohead has ever made; they cannot effectively sell this kind of heavier rock sound, and the result is an awkward mess of a bland riff with Thom Yorke shouting outside of what he can do interestingly. It is the highest energy that the album reaches, and it feels completely out of place. The lyrics as well are uncharacteristically straightforward; where “Fitter Happier” points to a world out of balance, “Electioneering” instead exclaims its message while maintaining an imprecise attitude towards it. It critiques the platonic ideal of a politician, but the subject has no ties to any party or alignment. It simply goes down the middle, critiquing a subject we all know is corrupt; there is no power to its protests, as they are directionless. In more of a craft issue, however, the album fails in its most ambitious moments; “Exit Music (For a Film),” for example, is built around an overwhelming crescendo, but both its rise and conclusion are far too abrupt to have weight. More consistently disappointing, though, is “Paranoid Android,” which is a suite in the vein of Wings’ “Band on the Run” or Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody,” but it shifts between its moments too quickly, failing the atmosphere which it often comes very close to building.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that OK Computer has higher highs and lower lows than anything Radiohead had done to this point. Ultimately, that might be what makes its legacy particularly fascinating; it is anything but mediocre, diving into a strange auteurism which is irreplaceable. While they are fully derivative of many other bands, nobody else could make this particular album at this particular time. The blend they discovered here is lightning in a bottle, counter-culture which lands at a time which makes its ideals completely natural and ordinary for the world at large. It is the definition of middle-brow, something which provides a pleasant challenge and rewards a focused listen just slightly more than their mainstream contemporaries did.']",3.00 stars

Then the track chills down with a beautiful vocal performance by Thom.

Exit Music is a silent, beautiful track with amazing vocals from Thom. Then 3 minutes into the track, it goes insane, and it's a highlight from the album. Let Down is another great track with a memorable melody and vocal performance. Karma Police is the biggest hit from the album, and it's clear to see why! It has a memorable melody, deep lyrics, and one of my favorite vocal deliveries from Thom.\n\nElectioneering is a very unique and heavy cut from the album, and it's different from the rest of the album. The bassline on Climbing Up The Walls is amazing and it's a very unique but welcome vocal performance. No Surprises is beautiful and memorable, being one of my favorite cuts off the album. Thom's vocals, the beautiful melody, and the replay-ability of the song make it the one I find myself always coming back to.\n\nLucky is another fantastic song from the album, with a very memorable vocal performance and a great bass hook.

Aquel indie rock de su ópera prima y las guitarras filosas de The Bends no hacían presagiar una evolución tan asombrosa, cautivante e innovadora como resultó OK Computer.\nEl álbum fue un punto de inflexión para el rock de su época. Una bomba sónica que estalló en su firmamento: ¡El siglo 21 comienzó aquí! OK Computer ha ejercido una influencia seminal en la escena conectando rock con electrónica, y mucho de impronta propia. Captando como nadie lo que ocurría a su alrededor. Leyendo a la Generación X pero, sobre todo, presagiando la era Millenninal.\n\nOK Computer fue un hechizo del que todos, sin tapujos, bebieron. Una verdadera obra maestra de comienzo a final. Un álbum que cuela lo atmosférico e intimista con lo desestructurado y robótico, donde las guitarras chillonas y angulosas se funden con baterías procesadas y sintetizadores. Que ensaya climas angustiantes y sórdidos a la vez que imprime un carácter épico a las canciones.\nOK Computer es EL disco de los 90, inmortal e inolvidable por mérito propio, que derrumbó definitivamente las barreras entre ""rock y máquinas"" todavía, retrógradamente, imperantes. Una gesta que marcó el pulso de los tiempos por venir y el eje central de una trilogía inalcanzable para sus contemporáneos: The Bends / OK Computer / Kid A.\n\nRadiohead fue la banda que entendió el verdadero legado de los grandes de la historia: búsqueda, experimentación y reinvención. Ellos escarbaron en la periferia y bebieron de todas las fuentes, desde su más notoria influencia Krautrock hasta la moderna estética IDM contemporánea, para seguir evolucionando y sosteniendo en el tiempo una excelencia pocas veces vista en la historia de la cultura pop.\n\nHoy hablamos de Sgt.

Powerful and scarily accurate poetry that seems more relevant by the day.\nNo Surprises is one of my favourite songs ever. The gentle guitar riff, Thom's voice, the overall musical arrangement and the lyrical content is so perfect to me.\nThe message of this song is that by a certain age we are expected to just fall into the mould that society has cast for us.

KARTERVANGOGHZ,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '— A fraction of my journey through the eminent RYM Top 100 as of 2021: OK Computer at #1\n\nOne could only imagine a painfully frostbite winter chipping away at dead-carcass robots when they listen to this record. Or perhaps a calm storm; something you watch off in the far distance as the winds gust grade by grade. Doom awaits. But what doesn’t heed are Thom Yorke’s faraway, alien vocals that ring throughout the rotting loudspeakers. All you have for yourself is your wits... kinda. A dystopian concept deep fried in a freezer for the night— guitars and drums as salt and pepper— and what comes out is a bittersweet icicle. Ironically, consumerism gnawed viciously on it’s roots and tore apart it’s circuits. And now, here it sits at the everlasting number one spot on RYM.\n\nThe concept itself would earn OK Computer a 5.0/5.0 for me. But this record really didn’t faze me. In theory, do albums owe me a broken jaw when I listen to them? Not really. But for a release so highly praised it earns itself ‘numero uno,’ I anticipated something much more. And that hunger is what killed my rating for this album. A shame, really... Listening through, I juggled between an extremely high rating; based on if I generalized how great it is, versus a moderate rating; based on my personal feelings on the album. I went with my wits. I’d be lying if I were to suck off this album in a review.\n\nGenerally speaking, Radiohead’s prized pig is an achingly bravo album. The concept is tightly strung around each song and doesn’t falter a minute. The thematic genre of a dramatic, siberian ballad holds true from ‘Airbag’ to ‘The Tourist.’ The nippy guitars color the dead dancefloor with an arctic aptitude. Yet, I’m dissatisfied. The filler of most of these songs kill that curiosity I had coming into this album. ‘Let Down,’ ‘Climbing Up the Walls,’ ‘Lucky,’ and ‘The Tourist’ were all tracks I dismissed even on my fifth listen. They clogged up the main powerhouse songs: ‘Paranoid Android,’ ‘Exit Music (For a Film),’ ‘Karma Police,’ and ‘Airbag.’\n\nObviously, I have a strong bias towards the more heavy, soul-crushing rock-ditties. And for an album whose purpose is to defrost onto the floor as OK Computer is, the slower songs should be the ones I favor the most. ‘Exit Music (For a Film)’ has a dreamstate climax, but the beginning is so barren I forget what’s happening until the unforgettable summit. ‘No Surprises’ is excruciatingly mediocre, and paired with some of the weakest songs on the album; it certainly makes me want to avoid it more.\n\nI really want to love this album. I adore the overall sound each track screeches and I can only beg for it to continue on. Yet, every time I listen to this album my worries are reaffirmed. The execution of the later songs is what kills the kid. The topdog brainchild of Thom Yorke should’ve pulled more out of me for being the mascot of this website. There is so much that could be explored, yet Yorke set camp out in the worst setting. And the album starts off so strong...']",5.00 stars

And I\'m deliberately just writing down all the positive things that I hear or see. I\'m not able to put them into music yet and I don\'t want to just force it"".\n\nYorke really aspired to make a beautiful record. But, if you\'ve heard any of Radiohead\'s music, you\'d know that he wasn\'t a very positive person. That\'s where the uniqueness of this album lies. Thom, someone who lived life without a veil, had to try to find the beauty in our world. A lot of people would say that this album is depressing or hopeless but it\'s really not (at least not entirely).\n\n""Airbag"" celebrates the preciousness of existence. ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" poetically encapsulates our want to sometimes escape from day-to-day life. ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" shows just how powerful love can be, albeit in a somewhat alarming way, and ""No Surprises"" appeals to our hope for a peaceful death.\n\nOf course, there\'s songs like ""Climbing Up the Walls"" (not saying these songs are unsuitable for OKC) but this album as a whole always leaves me feeling reassured. It\'s a reminder that we aren\'t alone in how we feel and for someone like me, that\'s occasionally necessary. That, coupled with these sounds I\'m just so familiarized with, makes this album a blanket of comfort. The amount of emotion, effort, and luck that goes into making an album went into creating each song on here.\n\nLike fine wine, OK Computer is an album that gets better with age.

The instrumentals break out of the rock-heavy style found on The Bends (Not knocking The Bends, love that record), and brings the group into more of an art-rock territory, while they still maintain plenty of originality and creativity. The culmination of the band\'s work flourishes in two particular songs more than the rest: No Surprises and Airbag. Airbag opens the album, and it shows a clear difference from the ending of The Bends (Street Spirit (Fade Out)). This one has a rock spirit, but you can tell the band is not brooding as much, they aren\'t as angry as they are on The Bends. This shows vulnerability. The band keeps the vulnerability going with No Surprises, which is easily a top 5 song all-time for me. This song is so fucking heartbreaking. It hurts me when I listen to it, and I\'d call it Radiohead\'s best track if they hadn\'t made my favorite song (A wolf at the door.). The real winner on this song is the culmination of Thom Yorke\'s vocals over top of the dreamy, spacey instrumental. The best example of what I\'m talking about is when Thom enters the final section of the song. In the wonderful music video, you see his head burst out of water, gasping for air, and after the instrumental break, this is exactly how the song makes me feel. Something about the way Thom sings the line ""Such a pretty house and Such a pretty girl"" makes me fucking cry, I mean it. It\'s soul-crushingly beautiful. And this is reflective of the rest of the album. There are so many emotional highs and lows that this is one of the most complete album experiences you can ever really listen to.

Тайтл трек Airbag повествует о страхе Йорка перед транспортной системой, глобализацией автомобилей и тем, что они могут повлечь за собой, песня - парадокс, выставляющая технологии в депрессивном свете, в то же время спасающими жизнь.\nИдейный посыл ярче всего иллюстрируется в композициях Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Fitter Happier - современность ждёт от человека повиновения, роботизации чувств и образа жизни, нужно быть безвольным ""существом"" способным лишь на продолжение рода, создание новой ячейки общества для увеличения капитала. Современные ценности об ""идеальном"" человеке и жизни без передряг идут вразрез с депрессивным, ментальным упадком и тревожностью, свойственными каждому индивиду, Climbing up the Walls и No Surprises ярко иллюстрируют эти противоречия между политическими нуждами и тем, что они за собой влекут. Психологические проблемы, в частности параноидальные мысли посещают в той или иной степени каждую свободную личность, капитализм задвигает это на второй план и обесценивает людей с такими проблемами, их стигматизируют и боятся.\nВ заключительном треке, том Йорк приводит метафору ""туриста"", как современного человека, который всегда куда то бежит и торопится, дабы посмотреть как можно больше, но по факту он не наслаждается тем, что видит, в полной мере, ему всего то нужно ""притормозить"", посмотреть по сторонам и жить свободной жизнью.\nОбщая атмосфера упадка и меланхолии лирики подкрепляется гитарным аккомпанементом, сложные рифы, струнные многоярусные мелодии создают атмосферу темного и безоблачного мира, который поглощает каждого человека с головой.']",4.50 stars

RotisBereft,"[""Loved by many, hated by many as well, Radiohead's third and most critically acclaimed album is without a doubt a very important album even several years after its release. While their earlier releases gained traction by getting released in an era of a huge britpop revival owed by a large factor to bands like Oasis and Blur this album is a significant step away from that sound. While the song structures are still based on the same formulas as those first two albums, the sounds they incorporate and the production drives them towards a more modern sounding approach and a futuristic approach as implied by the title. The sparse use of electronics is done in a subtle and effective way adding dreamy soundscape like textures and enriching the compositions. Keyboards and string arrangements are also used throughout the course of the album creating a dense melancholic atmosphere.\n\nThe opening track Airbag hints on the change of sound but is somewhat lacking and fails to hold the listener's attention. Paranoid Android and Karma Police are two of the most well known songs from the album, simple catchy melodies delivered in a confident tone that perfectly captures a band in transition but with enough experience to sound adventurous and massively appealing at the same time. Exit Music (For a Film) is probably the most depressive moment on the album, relying on a very soft acoustic guitar melody and Thom Yorke's almost wailing vocal performance to provide an emotional release. The album does get a little repetitive near the mid point with songs like Electioneering and Climbing Up the Walls failing to provide to much in the mix, without them being bad. It all pays up in the end though with No Surprises and Lucky being two of the finest moments on the album, relying on the pessimistic tone that the whole album is built upon to offer a sense of final release from the sweet melancholy that runs throughout the album.\n\nWhile OK Computer is not their most experimental, or their most groundbreaking effort it is definitely the finer point at which they found the perfect balance between being experimental and accessible. It is true that the album has received a lot more attention than it deserves from a musical standpoint but its influence and importance in the direction art rock and several forms of indie rock would move in the years to come is unparalleled. Music wise it is undoubtedly a very good album that manages to sound fresh and enjoyable even after all those years. It is the album that transformed Radiohead from followers to leaders and established them as a huge name in the music industry granting them the freedom to experiment with their sound without having to worry to much, resulting in some very interesting albums in the years to come.""]",3.50 stars

The best Songs which are featured in this album (in my opinion) are Electioneering, Paranoid Android and Climbing up the Walls. These songs capture the rawer and harsher sides to Radiohead's Discography which I feel is lost through later releases.

Noobyrubix,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I can\'t listen to this album without breaking down in tears. Every single song on this album is filled with so much raw emotion and power that I cannot listen with a straight face. The album kicks me right in the heart straight out the gate, with Airbag. The emotions in this song are too varied for me to even describle, but it pales in comparison to the second song on this album, Paranoid Android.\n\nThis is where most of my review will be focused, on this one song, this one, beautifully terrifying song. This song actually causes me to go into a schizophrenic breakdown, and I wish I was exaggerating when I say that. This song overloads my brain with so many emotions at once, and I always break down in tears halfway through the song, during the ""ambition makes you look pretty ugly"" section. This song also has the greatest end section I\'ve ever heard in any piece of music. Thom\'s tortured screams over the frantic guitar solo fills me with so much despair and desolation, and I genuinely have no option other than to sit in it, listening to the ending in full as it makes the feelings worse.\n\nThe next song that has such a profound effect on me is Karma Police, the objectively sadder song. This song is much less schizophrenic however, so it is less effective. That isn\'t to say it doesn\'t affect me however. The bridge alone is enough to make me break down in tears. This song fucking hurts the soul to listen to, as you hear Thom ripping his heart out through his throat, and it comes out with such beautifully devastating sounds. I adore this song just as much as Paranoid Android.\n\nThe last song I want to focus on, is Electioneering. This is a complete tonal shift from the rest of this album, yet it still feels that it belongs. This is such a cheery and energetic song, and it helps ease my mind while listening along to the full album. This gives me a breather from the constant despair, and for that I feel this might be the most important song on the entire record.\n\nOverall, this is, in my opinon, the greatest album of all time. I could probably go on for hours and hours about each song, but I won\'t make this any longer than it already is. This is the only album I would genuinely give an 11/10. This is a fucking ride, and one that I recommend listening to at least once in your entire life.']",5.00 stars

In my opinion it was musically way more interesting than Ok Computer which is kinda regular, but not one of the worst, 90s rock. BUT the worst thing about this album is Thom Yorke's vocal, if they replaced it with that voice synthesizer from Fitter Happier, this would get a star more. When it is the way it is, Yorke ruins like everything and some of these tracks might have been okayish (Subterranean etc. and Electioneering).

pettuccine8,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""What else can be said about Radiohead's groundbreaking and widely beloved 3rd studio album, ok computer. One of the most largely celebrated albums and considered by many to be one of the greatest of all time. It has gotten to a point where you can't be in online music circles without any mention of this album. You can say what you want about an album of this magnitude but I genuinely believe, despite the hype, it is anything but overrated.\n\nOverrated seems to be a term launched at any album someone doesn't like that happens to be loved by a large audience, despite actually considering its significance and the subjectivity of music. Radiohead's ok computer is as important to rock music as anything that came before or after and is a significant moment in their discography. Coming off of albums like Pablo honey and the bends, no one could have seen this one coming just around the corner.\n\nOk computer dives into vivid imagery of an almost dystopian and technology ridden society, through multiple breathtakingly gorgeous tracks. songs like paranoid android with its multiple phases and let down with its just utterly eargasmic conclusion remain some of the most mind-blowing I have ever heard. The power of this album does not stop there as every track absolutely delivers to me and from front to back it does not waste your time. The tourist may as well be the greatest album closer ever in my opinion and feels like I'm floating on a cold blue sea, spiraling out of control.\n\nThis album has been discussed to death from a musical standpoint and I feel as though there is more to say for my personal experiences with this work of art. I am absolutely serious when I say that my music taste and the way I see music would not be the same if it weren't for this album right here.

The paranoia I felt at the time was much more related to how people related to each other. But I was using the terminology of technology to express it.

I didn't really care much for the overall theme of the record of a dystopian robot ruled world, but it fleshes itself out pretty well.\n\nThe instrumentals are kind of whatever for me, it's just some pretty typical alternative rock music.

LukaB16,"[""I feel like this album has a weird paradox surrounding it. It feels as if this is an album where if you dislike it people can just say you don't like it because you are trying to be a contrarian, imagine not liking OK Computer, it's so good, how could you not like it? However, if you like it you're just following the crowd, what a pathetic sheep. So basically having an opinion on this album, the #1 album on this website, is just a total waste of time. Chances are, if you say you dislike this album then you're like me, you don't actually dislike the album, you just don't think it's as good as it's rated to be. That's all it boils down to for me. Of course this album has good moments, it can be exciting and emotional within the same track and that's quite impressive.

But not enough to listen to it often. I went into this being convinced that on previous listens I thought it was really good but tonight, after listening to it again, I find myself quite disappointed that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. Ideas got weirdly repetitive quickly, within and across tracks. I found myself thinking some of the tracks sounded a bit too similar, just sad alt-rock songs. My biggest issue is that it all sounds way too serious when the sound absolutely does not warrant the tone. Electioneering is probably the only song where it sounds as if they had fun making it, even though the entire album has the same instrumentals. I'm not sure how they achieved that but they did, in my eyes they did anyway.\n\nRegardless of my opinions on The Bends and Pablo Honey, at least they were fun.

indep_,"['OK Computer is, rightfully so, hailed as not only Radiohead\'s shining masterpiece, but one of rock music\'s best records as a whole. The album shows futuristic themes of dependence on technology, depersonalization, and social conformity. These themes are explored masterfully through 12 tracks that stand as very predictive for a record created in 1997.\n\nThe album kicks off with ""Airbag,"" a song that tells the story of the band\'s frontman, Thom Yorke, getting into a car crash with his girlfriend in 1987. His girlfriend suffered whiplash, but Thom walked away relatively unharmed. Thom uses this story to create a theme of technological dependence, as well as to create a dilemma regarding the car in the story. It was the car that got him into the crash, but it was the car that saved him. Thom in the song has just survived the crash and is being hit with a wave of relief and euphoria. He believes he can do anything. ""In an interstellar burst, I am back to save the universe."" Regarding the song\'s musicality, it\'s one of the album\'s brighter, happier songs. It\'s carried by strong guitar and strings. The bass only appears occasionally but is powerful when it does. Overall, a great way to begin the record, and a fun introduction to this landscape.\n\n""Airbag"" is followed by the album\'s magnum opus, ""Paranoid Android."" A multi-staged ballad of paranoia and confusion. The lyrics were inspired an experience in a bar where Thom was surrounded by people who were high on cocaine. The lyrics display Thom\'s distain for society. ""When I am king you will be first against the wall. With your opinion which is of no consequence."" The song is separated into 4 sections, reminiscent of Queen\'s ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" The first section is driven by acoustic guitar and haunting vocals with an ethereal and spacey vibe. The second section brings in more electric guitar with a brilliantly chaotic solo. This leads into the third section, a time for Thom\'s vocals to really shine, as he repeats ""Rain down, rain down. Come on, rain down on me."" The song concludes with another chaotic guitar part. Truly a masterful experience.\n\n""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" is a beautiful song written about the struggles of feeling alienated from society. The song detains Thom\'s desire to escape his earthly stress and have a moment of bliss. He uses the metaphor of being abducted by aliens. ""Take me on board their beautiful ship. Show me the world as I\'d love to see it."" It\'s a perfect song to mellow out with after the chaos of Paranoid Android. The haunting, beautiful guitar carries the song and gives it the otherworldly feel it has.\n\n""Exit Music"" is a large change in tone from the previous songs, being a melancholic reflection on star-crossed love. The song was written for a film adaptation of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and the lyrics make sense in this context. Thom explains the story of Romeo and Juliet, and their chance for romantic escape. Unfortunately, those who know the story know that it sadly doesn\'t work out. ""Now we are one. In everlasting peace."" ""Exit Music"" starts out quiet and subtle, but slowly builds into a very strong ending, with Thom\'s vocals at the forefront.\n\nAfter Exit Music\'s gloomy build up, we get hit with a breath of fresh air in ""Let Down,"" my personal favorite song on the record. In the track, Thom explains his struggles with keeping up with the stress of constant traveling. ""Transport, motorways and tram lines. Starting and then stopping. Taking off and landing."" Thom wants to bypass the waiting, cramped spaces, and boring travel. ""One day I am gonna grow wings."" The guitar at the beginning of the song is a perfect balance to Exit Music\'s sad piano. The sweet blends of instrumentation on Let Down transport you some place else. A world where we don\'t have to feel bogged down by constant travel. A world where we can just be free. The song concludes with a duet between an acoustic guitar and electronic beeping that feeds perfectly into ""Karma Police.""\n\n""Karma Police,"" which is arguably the biggest single off ""OK Computer"" is a great reflection on how the idea of Karma can be abused. It sees Thom call out certain people and call for the ""Karma Police"" to catch them. By the end Thom realizes that this action in itself can cause karma to catch up to him, with his repetition of ""For a minute there I lost myself."" The song is driven by acoustic guitar and piano, however on the intro it is taken over by a loud, demanding electronic sound that closes out the track perfectly.\n\nThe interlude ""Fitter Happier"" starts the second half of the album with a melancholy piano part in the background of a robotic voice explaining the ideal human situation in the future, a sad, fake world of repressed emotion. This leads directly into ""Electioneering,"" a riff driven exciting peace about political corruption. While not really fitting too well with the rest of the album, it\'s still a great song to really rock out to, something rare on this album.\n\n""Climbing up the Walls"" is a truly creepy song inspired by a time Thom worked at a metal institution. The song explores themes of mental illness, or really anything that inescapable but subtle. ""And either way you turn, I\'ll be there."" Thom\'s vocal distortion, the faded drums, strange noises, and strings really help to make this a very haunting piece. The song starts to build around the 3 minute mark, reaches a climax, then deconstructs itself into an ambient soundscape before fading away completely. one of my favorite songs on the album and truly brilliant.\n\nAnother huge shift in tone comes with the lullaby sounding ""No Surprises,"" which explains what it\'s like to live in poverty and be a cog in society. It explores how this live is slowly breaking Thom down, which is expressed in the music video, with the helmet slowly being filled up with water. The song beautifully blends the sounds of many instruments to create a sweet melody that masks the depressing vocals. It\'s beautifully sad.\n\n""Lucky,"" which was the first song ever recorded for ""OK Computer,"" is about an ordinary person stepping up to the roll of a hero, and having that raise his ego. ""The Head of State had called for me by name. But I don\'t have time for him."" I personally think this is probably the most underrated song on the album. Jonny\'s guitar work on the chorus encapsulates the uplifting theme of the song.\n\nFinally, the album closes with ""The Tourist,"" a slow finisher that really rounds out the sound of the album and leaves you feeling satisfied. It is sadly one of the weakest songs on the record in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, OK Computer is an album that will stand the test of time and will continue to inspire rock artists to this day.', '']",5.00 stars

KQKHereComesThePain,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'It\'s OK Computer. If it is, indeed, overrated and overplayed then it got that way for a reason. It is seriously that good. It is really an imaginative and visceral album.\n\nIt is very hard to actually sit down and talk about OK Computer. It is very hard to discuss any revered or ""classic"" album, because it is obscured by rhetoric on both sides. To admirers and fanatics, it is the greatest album of all time. To detractors and reactionaries, it is the worst album of all time. Even the grey area is split on this album, with some people reasoning it\'s overrated, and a few even suggesting it is underrated. There is no consensus on this album, even though it has had various accolades bestowed upon it since the day it come out. Whether or not it deserves this position is of no interest to me, whatsoever.\n\nI mean, how about we listen to the actual music? Just forget all about audience reaction, and take this album to its bare essentials. What we have is an album that is at times highly enjoyable and incredibly difficult to get into. I\'d argue it\'s a more difficult album to get into than their follow-up, Kid A. It takes the guitar rock sound of the previous albums and pushes it to its logical conclusion. At points, this album pushes beyond guitar rock, incorporating elements of ambient music, progressive rock (not nearly to the extent as others suggest, though), kraut rock and even jazz. What we get is a mix of so many influences, that one cannot really call OK Computer an ""original"" album. However, that criticism is as old as the hills. If you\'re gonna make your music sound like your influences, make sure you do it the best out of anyone else. This is what Radiohead did with OK Computer.\n\nThat first side - I cannot exactly put it into words. The first six tracks of this twelve track album are all of the same quality, are all retained, and are all nothing short of fantastic. I won\'t go too much into track by track, but considering the opening two tracks are so closely linked, it\'s worth talking about them as if they were one. Airbag opens the album, and the cut-up drums, at once synthetic but also containing a human quality, drive the rhythms, as well as the occasional bass. The atmospheric guitars, intertwined - one for rhythm, one for lead, and another for lead (though more experimental) make this track a great one, from the opening guitar attacks to the duel solos between Greenwood and O\'Brien. In the midst of all of this, we get Thom Yorke. Yes, he is whiny at times. However, whilst it annoyed me on The Bends, here it\'s perfect. I mean, given the song is about being ""born again"" after a crash with a ""fast German car"", wouldn\'t you be? Then again, this is not pity, but catharsis. He\'s invigorated by the experience, and the adrenaline, he\'s ""amazed"" he\'s survived. He likens it to an ""interstellar burst"", and feels that he\'s ""come back to save the universe"". This is a rather odd reaction to a car crash, but the sensation, the rush, is all too real for the narrator to comprehend.\n\nIt the same narrator throughout all of the songs? If so, the hero of Airbag is now a Paranoid Android. This song is the longest on the album, but is also the busiest. It\'s cut into quarters, essentially. The opening section contains Latin American style percussion over rather unwinding minor chords on an acoustic guitar, with guitars coming in and out as they please. Yorke\'s vocals are full of anguish, wanting the listener to ""stop the noise/I\'m trying to get some rest"". It\'s at times aggressive, almost subtly, when he reckons ""when I am king/you will be first against the wall"". This anger is then fully let out in the explosive second section, with all guitars coming in, the drums switching from a modest shuffle to an all-out alternative rock assault. There\'s even some 7/8 time signature magic, and a guitar solo that is more of a freak-out than anything.\n\nMoments like the third section of Paranoid Android are so mesmerizing, and so beautiful, that it\'s very difficult to comprehend them. I mean, this slower part of OK Computer repeats itself on tracks like Exit Music (For a Film) or Lucky, or The Tourist. The synths add as a choir, amidst harmonizing vocal overdubs. Yorke\'s repetition of ""rain down on me/from a great height"", the way his voice rises and falls, over the other voices- it\'s truly mesmerizing. The final part of this section builds up over the rather macabre additions of ""pig\'s skin"", ""yuppies networking"", the ""panic/the vomit"". After a snide ""god loves his children, yeaaah"", the second, loud section is replayed, blowing the song out of the water. Sound effects are added- the sound of someone drowning, screaming, and random vocals- over another guitar solo, before the track switches off.\n\nThis first side places two great tracks together, Let Down and Karma Police (we\'ll get to Sub and Exit later). The former track is a seldom performed yet beautifully melodic gem, with vocal harmonies, arpeggiated guitars, and video game like keys in the middle eight. The drums are pounding, almost tribal in places, but the lyrics - oh my god, those lyrics. At once, they are miserable and monotonous, but altogether incredibly beautiful. How can a chorus consisting of being ""crushed like a bug in the ground"" be so...uplifting? How on Earth can this album be depressing when the music is so anthemic, so life-affirming? Maybe that is the message, or the ""concept"" of the album, that even if you want to ""grow wings"", it would be a ""chemical reaction"" anyway, meaning you have to face your problems without any intervention from a higher being. (at least, that\'s how I interpret these lyrics)\n\nKarma Police is the best track on this album. Hands down. It lives and breathes OK Computer. Its lyrics of arresting those who ""talk in math...buzzes like a fridge"", or women with ""Hitler hairdos"" are incredibly indicative of how politics - both on the left and the right - essentially focuses a lot of its time on trivial matters. The chorus, over Sexy Sadie\'s piano and acoustic guitar - ""this is what you get/when you mess with us"" - is at once threatening and sweet. The verses, with the stomp of the drums over said piano and guitar - the occasional backing vocals that sound so distant and far away - also have an ongoing threat to them. The second verse\'s pleading, its backtracking, the narrator giving all he can but ""it\'s not enough...we\'re still on the payroll"" shows a reliance on money over his personal desires. Sounds like he\'s going to break down, right?\n\nWrong. The ending bridge of, ""for a minute there/I lost myself"", the shift to B minor - but still with major chords - changes the entire tone of the song. Either the narrator has learnt the error of his ways, or has sidestepped his feelings of guilt, to still participate as a member of the karma police. The ambiguity has little time for questions, for within a few bars, guitar feedback enters the song. The song ends in a nightmarish fashion, with the feedback unwinding, exploding.\n\nOh, and, Fitter Happier and Electioneering are by no means weak tracks. Fitter Happier is, essentially, the manifesto of the album. It details the views expressed within, over what appears to be Microsoft Sam. It cuts away from images of ""children smiling in the backseat"" to ""flushing spiders down the plughole"", all over electronic noise and guitar feedback. The ending ""a pig in a cage on antibiotics"" suggests dehumanisation, leading right into Electioneering, which is the rockiest number on here. The lyrics, as overtly political as they are, are very snide. Take the mention of ""voodoo economics"", or the inclusion of ""I trust I can rely on your vote"". The chorus, too, over the trio of guitars, of ""when I go forwards/you go backwards/and somewhere we will meet"", shows at once an honesty of the distance between politicians and the public, and a sarcastic solution or optimism over the whole thing. It\'s alienation.\n\nSpeaking of, alienation is a major theme of this album. Why else would the protagonist of Subterranean Homesick Alien want to live ""up above"" where ""aliens hover""? Why else would he ""wish that they would swoop down"" to ""take"" him on board ""their beautiful ship?"" He feels alienated by his peers, who ""never believe me"", who would be shut away, yet ""feels alright/I\'m just uptight"". The music that accompanies the narrative acts out the fantasy - space rock, pitch-shifted guitars, twinkling keyboards, and rather plodding drums. The chorus seems to explode this fantasy, to reveal his insecurities of the world around him, the world that isn\'t the one he wants.\n\nIt continues on No Surprises, a bitter ode to the ideal life, so to speak. The ironic use of twinkling xylophone, against arpeggios and acoustic guitar over lyrics which profess to wanting to end life via ""a handshake of carbon monoxide"". The narrator is tired of drama, he wants ""no alarms and no surprises"", but previously expressed a desire to ""bring down the government"", losing his heart. Maybe the ""job that slowly kills"" has slowly killed him, too. The lyrics are also distressing- ""my final fit/my final bellyache""- and at once hopeful (""such a pretty house/and such a pretty garden""). Over the final chorus, backing vocals sing, ""get me out of here"". This life of peace is not for him. He feels like he had no choice.\n\nWhat other choice do the protagonists on Exit Music have? They must leave before ""all hell breaks loose"", and must travel in the cold, singing songs ""to keep us warm"". The sombre first verse, a simple acoustic guitar, then turns into a bridge section with a keyboard. The second verse has a weird effect on it, that sounds like a city street, before the drums come in. Suddenly, distorted bass dominates the mix, over reverb and delay heavy, tremolo-picked guitars. Yorke\'s tale takes a new turn: ""you can laugh/a spineless laugh"". Is this towards his lover or his detractors? Either way, the hope that ""your rules and wisdom choke you"" is dark. It\'s a darkness on par with Unknown Pleasures. The ending ends the same as Romeo and Juliet, ""we are one/in everlasting peace"". In their death, their dying wish is ""we hope that you choke"", before the song dies down.\n\nYou can tell Radiohead like Pixies, because loud-quiet-loud dynamics are everywhere on this album. Paranoid Android, Exit Music, to name a few. However, Climbing Up the Walls is the noisiest and creepiest song on the album. This one really is scary, not contrived scary or theatrical fear. This is genuine terror. The distorted vocals, softly sung over industrial drums and distorted bass, sing about being ""the key in the lock in your house/that keeps your toys in the basement"". It\'s all paranoia to the nth degree, being a reflection, or being ""everywhere you turn...open up your skull/I\'ll be there"". The second verse, drumming wise, transfers onto the ride cymbal, adding flourishes of a crescendo. Strings appear in the choruses, but are more prominent in the second chorus. Electric guitar can be heard too, and the lyrics become more obscure to understand - ""fifteen skulls to the back of your head""; ""I\'ve got the smell of a local man/who\'s got the loneliest feeling"" - before a massive interlude over an echoey clarinet (?) solo. When Thom comes back to sing the song title a few more times, dissonant strings join him, over a final scream. The song\'s insect noises and strings die down.\n\nLucky is also fond of this sort of structure. Starting with O\'Brien playing on the nut of his guitar, Yorke enters over the ride cymbal with ""I\'m on a roll/this time/I feel my luck could change"". His guitar is scratchy, and the bass is full of motion. The scenes of a plane crash unfold over lead guitar - his wish for Sarah to kill him again ""with love"" have been met - as he is pulled out ""of the air crash...of the lake/coz I\'m your superhero"". The instruments back out, save for Yorke and his guitar, intoning, ""we are standing on the edge"". The addition of choir like keyboards on the second verse creates a rather heavenly feel, over Thom\'s refusal to listen to ""the Head of State"". He repeats that ""it\'s gonna be a glorious day"", almost sarcastically, but something tells me the protagonist takes the air crash as a source of pride. The outro, which again builds things up, gradually adding guitars, the music becoming more aggressive, before a closing repetition of the chorus, and ""we are standing on the edge"".\n\nThe song segways into the album closer, The Tourist, and it is a great album closer because it gives the listener a chance to ""slow down"" after what has happened thus far. The rather jazzy, calm instrumentation over Peter Green style Albatross slide guitars, contrast with the lyrics of more alienation, being singled out by a dog that ""barks at no-one else but me/like it\'s seen a ghost"". So, is the narrator literally a tourist or a tourist going into the afterlife? The heavenly synths in the chorus of ""hey man, slow down/idiot, slow down"" seems to suggest both. The mentions of ""sparks"", or ""a thousand feet per second"", seems to reckon back to album opener Airbag. In fact, the chorus could be an exclamation, inviting either the narrator himself or the other driver to ""slow down"". The closing guitar solo uplifts the song, before all dies down, except for a little triangle ping. Theories exist that the last two tracks of OK Computer link back to Airbag, and then the album goes around in circles. I support this theory.\n\nOK Computer is one of my favourite albums of all time. It encompasses a range of styles and influences, creates thought-provoking lyrics, and showcases a knack for writing pop songs within a more complicated framework. I don\'t care what poll it\'s on, whether it be among the greatest albums of all time, or the most overrated albums of all time. I personally enjoy it, and I find something new with every listen.\n\nStay fit and happy, and whatever you do, turn it all the way up.']",5.00 stars
tsbhollis,"['Look, this album is amazing, but it ain\'t no My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy or my personal Radiohead favourite In Rainbows, but I guess it\'s ok.

namelessthekd,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Radiohead, who didn\'t succeed with their first studio album Pablo Honey in 1993, but signaled that they will be one of the biggest rock bands of the future with The Bends in 1995 and OK Computer in 1997, made songs that sometimes translate our feelings in our personal space and remind us that we live in a society.\n\n\nAccording to most critics, Radiohaed is one of the greatest rock bands ever, with Thom Yorke\'s excellent songwriting and vocals, Jonny Greenwood\'s unique guitar, Ed O\'brien\'s back vocals and guitars that create an incredible atmosphere in songs and Phil Selway\'s harmony in the band. And again, according to many critics, the best album of this rock band is OK Computer. Maybe even the best album ever made.\n\nThe most important factors in the writing of this album are the environment created by modernism and the enslavement of people, one of the most fundamental results of neoliberalism, at the end of the 20th century. Written with a kind of post-modernist movement, this album mostly depicts the crisis people experience from the mouth of a real person or from a third point of view.\n\nThere is a passive rebellion against the role of the individual in society and the system that carries out this role in the first-person song. In the songs told with a divine perspective, the relationship between individual and society is examined. Thom yorke did not use clear language while writing these songs, so the songs make us think.\n\n\n\nThe album is also a perfect album musically. The album contains many elements, from experimental parts in some tracks to pieces that guitars are not used extensively like “No Surprises”. In this way, emotion transformations are very intense within the album and the album is musically fluent. For example, many critics think that “Paranoid Android” contains 3 separate songs.\nIn addition, different environments created in some intermediate transitions add a different flavor to the album. For example, the song ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"", which tells the story of a man who forgets the meaning of life, can take you into space in an instant and make you watch the world from a spaceship as promised in the song.\n\nSometimes you listen to songs on the album that push you to face your personal feelings. And while you listen to these songs, sometimes you get hopeful, sometimes you admit that there is no exit from the current situation and you are helplessly silent.\n\nSometimes, the narrator suggests that you should do the behavior that the system ideally shows you. Of course, this narrative is made with a critical point of view. In the song, the narrator\'s voice represents a sort of industrial world.\n\n\nThis album, which includes excitement, fear, despair, sadness and rebellion in general, was written as a post-modernist rebellion to the industrial world by the end of the 20th century. This album is a masterpiece that claims to be the greatest album ever, both musically and in terms of lyrics. And it is perhaps the most important thing that brought Radiohead to where it is now.\n\nThis album also has a very important place for me emotionally and it is my favorite album.

The treath technology brings to us all and the state of the modern world. Ok computer is probably Radiohead’s strongest album conceptually though it’s very close. The album is filled with Thom’s amazing lyrics and ability to tell stories with the prime example being ‘paranoid Android’ dealing heavily with paranoia, anxiety and loneliness in the world that is changing very fast into a technological age. It does this perfectly like the whole album does. One of my favorite moments on it is ‘no surprises’ the heavy guitar riffs and instrumentation are gone and all that is left is a stripped down, extremely beautiful song that just makes you think for minute. The album ends on ‘the tourist’ an amazing outro finishing of the album perfectly by recognizing how fast the world is declining and Thom asking it to slow down. this album is praised as the best albums of all time on multiple websites and online communities, though it isn’t for me it’s still a masterpiece that is worthy of all the praise it receives.', '9.5/10']",4.00 stars

manicstreetmotherfucker,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'OK Computer is the third studio album released by English alternative rock band Radiohead. The album was released on 21st May 1997 by Parlophone Records and Capitol Records, depending on the region. The album was produced by Radiohead, along with now long time collaborator Nigel Godrich, who would go on to produce every other Radiohead album since OK Computer. The album was recorded over the 8 month period of July 1996 - March 1997, with the exception of the track Lucky which was recorded on 4th September 1995. The album was recorded mainly in St. Catherine\'s Court near Bath in Somerset and clocks in at 53 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nIn September of 1995, Radiohead were commissioned to take part in The Help Album, a charity album from War Child, in support of victims, mainly, of the ongoing war in Bosnia, which would end in December of that year, with the death toll standing at around 100,000. The song the Radiohead contributed was Lucky which would later find its way onto OK Computer. Finding themselves tired after extensive touring for The Bends, the band decided to take a break in January 1996, returning to the studio to demo tracks for their next album. After a few months in the studio, Radiohead headed out on a 13 show long tour in America. On this tour, Radiohead were asked by director Baz Luhrmann to contribute a song to the soundtrack of his upcoming adaptation of William Shakespeare’s classic romantic tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. Thom Yorke told HUMO Magazine that:\n“When we saw the scene where Claire Danes (Juliet) holds the Colt. 45 to against her head, we started working on the song immediately.”\nThe song they created was the aptly titled, (Exit Music) For a Film, which plays over the film’s end credits. The song was kept off of the film’s soundtrack, but would, as with Lucky, find its way onto OK Computer. The band started recording the album proper in July 1996, mainly at St. Catherine’s Court in Somerset. The bend were not contempt with just continuing the commercial sound of Pablo Honey and The Bends, with Ed O’Brien telling Q Magazine in 2003 that:\n“Everyone said ‘You’ll sell six or seven million copies if you bring out The Bends Pt.2’ and we’re like ‘we’ll kick against that and do the opposite.’”\nThe album’s music was inspired by artists like Miles Davis, Elvis Costello, & R.E.M., with lyrics inspired by the political writings of anarcho-syndicalist / libetarian socialist Noam Chomsky, among other things. Thom told Melody Maker:\n“On this album, the outside world became all there was… I’m just taking polaroids of things moving too fast.”\nSome recurring themes of the album are technology, modern life, & the future. The title of the album comes from the 1978 radio adaptation of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which the band listened to on their 1996 American tour. Thom said:\n“(the title) refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, our future, of everyone else’s”\nOther considered titles were Ones and Zeroes, & Your Home is at Risk If You Do Not Keep Up Payments. The album’s artwork was done by Thom (credited as White Chocolate Farm), and seasoned Radiohead collaborator, Stanley Donwood. The artwork shares the same apocalyptic feel as the album, a result of Donwood “trying to make something the colour of bleached bone”.\n\nThe first track on the album is Airbag, a song inspired by a car accident Thom got in in the 80s, with his life being saved by an Airbag. This theme had already been visited by Radiohead on their 1995 High and Dry / Planet Telex b-side Killer Cars, which (spoilers) is a better song. Unfortunately, Radiohead decided to open up OK Computer with the weakest track. Not that it\'s bad or anything. Just not to the degree of quality of the rest of the record. The song is, however, a success at setting the atmosphere for the record, with the introduction of the idea of the danger of new scary technology (like cars, I guess). The song also refrences reincarnation with the lyric ""an airbag saved my life coming from a magazine article Thom read. 8/10.\n\nNext up is the inequitable classic, Paranoid Android. Thom wrote the lyrics after an unpleasant night in a bar in Los Angeles where he saw a woman react violently to having a drink spilt on her, imagery that is replicated in the song’s music video. He is quoted as saying that “Paranoid Android is about the dullest fucking people on Earth.” The (great) title serves as the album’s second reference to the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, coming from the character Marvin the Paranoid Android. The track provides a great example of Thom’s trademark falsetto vocals. Structurally, the track is comparable to Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, starting relatively slow and light, before moving into a Sonic Youth sounding guitar rock sound, and then moving into the angelic bridge. Speaking of, I really like the bridge. It showcases some of Thom’s best lyricism, creating a vivid image of an apocalyptic hel;lscape unfolding before your eyes. 9/10.\n\nTrack 3 is Subterranean Homesick Alien, a song about a narrator who wishes to be abducted by aliens in order to escape his dull life. The track was inspired by an assignment Thom received while still at school, where he had to write ‘martian poetry’. With a title that references the 1965 Bob Dylan song Subterranean Homesick Blues, the track features brilliant reverb guitar and drum rolls that well represent the feeling of alienation, as well as giving the track a fitting empty, space like feel. I particularly enjoy the use of a pause in the line “they shut me away… but I’m alright.\'\' 9/10.\n\nTrack 4 is Exit Music (For a Film), which does, in fact, serve as the exit music to a film, with that film being Baz Luhrman’s 1996 Shakespeare adaptation Romeo + Juliet. The song itself takes inspiration from the classic tragedy, with Thom telling Select in July 1997:\n“I saw the Zefferelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out because I couldn’t understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn’t just run away. It’s a song for two people who should just run away before all the bad stuff starts.”\nThe track features atmospheric guitar, paired with an almost unsettling closeness with the vocals. The choral vocals that are brought in as the chorus starts give a warm, apocalyptic feel, an atmosphere that is furthered in verse 2 with the inclusion of unintelligible sounds in the background. The song then bursts out with the addition of drums, then heavily distorted guitar, and then bass, before once again fading away, with Thom giving out some frail sounding “we hope that you choke”s. 10/10.\n\nNext up is track 5, Let Down, a song that, to me at least, has always sounded like a love song. Apparently, according to Thom “about that thing you get when you’re in transit, but you’re not in control of it”, which I guess makes sense. That quote, now that I think about it just reminds me of the bit in Father Ted where a smiling Father Kevin is sitting on the bus and the driver puts on the radio, and lo and behold, an acoustic version of Exit Music (For a Film) starts playing, causing Father Kevin to rapidly fall into a depressive state. Great stuff. Shame one of the creators is a massive transphobe though. Anyway, back to Radiohead. The song on the surface seems more straightforward than the previous tracks, but, as with most Radiohead songs, nothing is as simple as it seems. Jonny’s guitar is playing at a different time signature to everyone else’s instruments, helping to create a Phil Spector-esque wall of sound. One line that particularly stands out as summarises Thom’s attitude to himself and life throughout the record is “hysterical and useless”. 9/10.\n\nTrack 6 is Karma Police, a pleading song about the idea that you’ll never be happy in a capitalist society, under your boss’ thumb. The title and lyrics come from an inside joke from The Bends tour. Jonny said in an interview in May 1997: “Whenever someone was behaving in a particularly shitty way, we’d say ‘the Karma Police will catch up with you sooner or later.’” The heavy drums and bass hit create a dark rhythm that gives you the feeling of being dragged away by the police. The line about the “Hitler hairdo” still catches me off guard, even after listening to it so many times. I like the piano in the chorus that pairs well with some almost Bowie-esque vocals from Thom. 9/10.\n\nFitter. Happier. Track 7. Thom Yorke told Melody Maker that “(Fitter Happier is) the most upsetting thing that I’ve ever written.” I can’t say I completely agree, but it’s definitely up there. Fitter Happier creates a vivid image of a desolate, sterile society where everyone is “fitter, happier.” The track features chilling, haunting piano paired with vocals done by ‘Fred’, one of the synthesised voices from the Macintosh application, Simple Text. Furthering this feel, is the use of musique concréte, with audio from the 1975 political thriller Three Days of the Condor. I always used to skip this song, but it has since become one of my favourites. 10/10.\n\nNext up is track 8, Electioneering, probably the most overtly political track on the album, being inspired by the Poll Tax riots of 31/03/90, as well as Noam Chomsky’s analysis of contemporary mass media under the propaganda model from his 1988 book, Manufacturing Consent. I suppose I should probably explain the Poll Tax riots. The Poll Tax (or to give it its formal name, the Community Charge) was introduced by Margaret Thatcher in Scotland in 1989, and in England and Wales in 1990. The Poll Tax placed a single flat-rate per-capita tax on every adult in a household. This ended up harming those who were less well-off (I wonder if the Tories knew that was gonna happen, eh?) leading to the riots of 31st March 1990, which led to 339 arrests. The Poll Tax was abolished in 1991 and was replaced by the Council Tax in 1993. Onto the song, it stands out on the album as having a heavier, noise rock sound with great drumming that creates the feeling of a riot. Thom described the track as “a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones”. 9/10.\n\nTrack 9 is called Climbing Up the Walls and features lyrics about Thom\'s time as an orderly in a psychiatric ward hospital. It was also inspired by Krzysztof Penderecki\'s modern classical composition Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, which, just to add an additional fun fact, is sampled in the \'Heavenly version\' of Manic Street Preachers\' track You Love Us. The song provides a chilling piece, like the audio version of a horror movie, aided by Thom\'s vocals which remain in his high register throughout the track. The strings also kinda make it sound like a Bond theme. I think the reviewer from Select magazine puts it better than i ever could:\n""Thom\'s voice dissolving in a fearful blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo"". 9/10.\n\nNext up is No Surprises, and I\'m just gonna cut the bullshit and say, as of today, as I write this, at 10:28pm on Thursday 10th December 2020, that this is my favourite Radiohead song. The way the guitar just cuts through the atmosphere, the overall sound, the lyrics. Perfect. All that and it was somehow recorded in one take. Apparently Radiohead strove to replicate Louis Armstrong\'s 1967 classic What a Wonderful World, which is a job well done in my mind, though a more overtly desolate version. The song also replicates, as Thom put it, a ""fucked-up nursery rhyme"". No Surprises runs parallel in my mind to the song This is Yesterday by Manic Street Preachers from their 1994 magnum opus, The Holy Bible. Both tracks have a downtrodden, yet somehow upbeat sounds, as well as similar lyrical themes (see: ""such a pretty house and such a pretty garden"" from No Surprises, and ""houses as ruins and gardens as weeds"" from This is Yesterday). Beautiful song. 10/10.\n\nTrack 11 is Lucky, which had previously been released on the 1995 Help! compilation from War Child. The song is inspired by the ongoing (in 1995, it had ended by 1997) Bosnian War, which was an extremely brutal conflict, with horrendous war crimes being committed (mainly) by the Yugoslavia supported Serbia. The majority of proceeds from the Help! compilation going to those affected by the Bosnian War. When you remove this context, the song\'s lyrics sound ominous and almost evil. Lyrics like:\n""Kill me Sarah""\n""I feel my luck could change""\n""It\'s gonna be a glorious day""\nreally exemplify this feeling.\n9/10.\n\nNext up is track 12, The Tourist a song about tourists Thom saw rushing around France. Jonny was the main writer of the song\'s music, drawing inspiration from the same place Thom did for the lyrics. This track *feels* like a closing track, even from its start, which was one of Jonny\'s main aims. The song has really nice guitar, peaceful to start, but begins to build up. It kinda feels like you\'re being shot into space. 9/10.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 92/100\n\nCapitol Records considered the album to be ""commercial suicide"", but nevertheless (along with Parlophone) launched a large marketing campaign which included:\n-print advertisements\n-adverts in Tube stations in London\n-t-shirts\n-an FM radio in the shape of a computer (very clever, boys)\n-a floppy disk with Radiohead screensaver (how cutting edge)\n-1000 cassette players with promo tapes of the album stuck in\nThese marketing efforts proved successful as the album debuted at #1 in the UK and #21 in the US. The album sold 136,000 copies in the UK in its first week, going on to become the best selling album of 1997 in the UK. OK Computer has sold 7.8 million copies to date, making it Radiohead\'s best selling album.\n\nThe Against Demons Tour began in Barcelona on 22/05/97. The band went across the UK, Ireland, Continental Europe, North America, Japan & Oceania. The tour concluded on 18/04/98 in New York. Thom told Mojo in August 2003:\n""That was a year too long. I was the first person to tire of it, then six months later everyone in the band was saying it. Then six months after that, nobody was talking anymore.""\n\nOK Computer received universal acclaim from critics and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 1998 Grammys, but lost to Time Out of Mind by Bob Dylan. It won the Grammy for Best Alternative Album. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards and was shortlisted for a Mercury Prize. Thom said of the album\'s reception in 2007:\n""What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create."" The album is preserved in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress, as of 2014.', 'https://manicstreetmotherf\nucker.tumblr.com/post/637304988183429121/ok-computer-radioh\nead-1997-review', 'https://manicstreetmotherf', 'ucker.tumblr.com/post/637304988183429121/ok-computer-radioh']",5.00 stars
kiddae,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '""The Bends"" was for most people the record that defined the sound of Radiohead: a blend of a deeply emotional pre-sadcore structure and intense and aggressive post-grunge. The album was both a commercial but critical success, which gave the band the chance to do absolutely anything.\nRecorded alone in a haunted mansion, ""OK Computer"" was a enormous change in sound and ideas. Leaving traditional song structures, the band experiments with more free and complex structures, reminiscent of the old prog-rock eras. The little bleeps of effects from ""The Bends"" become huge walls of sound, with clear but very well used post-rock and shoegaze influences.\n\nRadiohead\'s openers are always other-worldly, painting the first impressions of the atmosphere and sounds to come in the record. ""Airbag"" is a cluster of intensity and alienation under airy guitars and a mix of organic and machine drums. It\'s energetic yet melancholic, with a slightly odd atmosphere and is probably the most dense track on the album and definitely a notable piece from their discography.\nAfter four beeps at the end, the complex prog-rock ish guitar-driven insanity of ""Paranoid Android"" is a slap on the face: being probably their longest song (almost 7 minutes), it\'s divided in 3 parts, and they\'re all very various but very completive too: the connection, both musically and thematically of those truly proves a step forward in maturity for the band.\n\nWithout any transition ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"", a heavily reverberated and other-worldly song, incorporates some of the more jazzy harmonies and weird filters in favor of an exceptional emotional intensity.\n""Exit Music (For A Film)"" calms down the previous track\'s agitation with a quiet, dark and haunting song. The structure and tension it creates is a breath-taking, and incredibly powerful in its climax. It\'s a cathartic experience, and recalls the crescendo structure from of the post-rock genre.\n""Let Down"" uses multiple layers of guitar to create an unique wall of sound, of complex harmonies and rhythms. The progression in this track leads to a huge and intense climax. The song is what would be the foundation of later pieces from the band.\n\n\nIn the second half of the album, ""Electioneering"" is the most straightforward guitar-driven track here. The absolute craziness of ""The Bends"" added with accusing political lyrics just works very well with the record.\n“Climbing Up The Walls”\'s distortion and aggressive effects climb to complete insanity, the summit is rough, incredibly wide with, notably the string section inspired by Penderecki\'s atonal writing. This track is horrifying, and extremely memorable.\nIn ""No Surprises"" the band calms down everything with  an oddly desesperated lullaby, probably one of their prettier song sonically, yet quite dark lyrically.\n""Lucky"" and ""The Tourist"" close the album beautifully with a breath-taking emotional intensity. These tracks are unbelievably smooth and colorful.\n\nIt is then obvious that the album has a very clear message to pass; ""OK Computer"" attacks that pre-internet world with a fear of a world overwhelmed by technology and continuous information. The reason why each songs are so different is that each of the tracks describe a particular character of society. The interlude track ""Fitter Happier"" shows that very explicitly: a computer-controlled artificial voice tells what seems to be advices but quickly becoming paranoid and terrifying.\nEvery song in there are very unique and almost perfect in their own way, from the despair of ""Exit Music (For A Film)"" to the terrifying agony of ""Climbing Up The Walls"" or the emotional intensity of ""The Tourist"". Overall the result is satisfying and seems meaningful.\n\n---\n\n""OK Computer"" is one of those perfect albums that never ceases to amaze me in how great the production, musicianship and songwriting in this are. Not only being flawless, this record is quite inpactful in its meaning and is a big twist from ""The Bends"", really pushing forward guitar music as what post-rock or shoegaze did, but here with an exceptional musicality.\nMasterpiece.\n\nFrom my Instagram page @_kiddae_', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CGo6BzdMEhW/']",4.50 stars
dreminus,"['This is a hard one to rate. This album (plus many other works by Radiohead) defined my teen years and was a foundation for a lot of my music taste. In order to properly rate this though, I need to take the nostalgia bias out... and that\'s difficult for me. The other bias I feel I need to take out is how hard it\'s been shilled by the media over the years (and on this site as well, at the time of writing it\'s the #1 album of all time and doesn\'t look like it\'s going to move). Still, listening to this album again I can\'t help but sing along...\n\nIn my opinion this is a transitional album, from their angst and pep of their previous era starting to mold into their more moody and experimental output to come later.\n\nUnfortunately, this leads to me having some confusion upon listening to this album again. It\'s hard to tell what this album wants to be. Is it singer-songwriter rock? Or is it experimental art rock? I just can\'t seem to see the contents here as a single entity, instead it feels like a tug-of-war.\n\nI\'ll focus on the songwriting first. There are some extremely good moments of awesome here (Paranoid Android, still an awesome song), but there are also some times where I feel like the songwriting is empty and only there to create a product (more of their poppier structured songs). However, I don\'t feel there\'s any inherently bad songs on here. I think that likely contributes heavily to the current site rating. Some of these songs rock out so hard.\n\nThen there\'s the experimentation. A lot of it feels like it was just placed on to be ""alternative"" or ""weird"" and I ate that up when I was a teenager, but these days it just feels like a mundane distraction. Fitter Happier is a pretty decent idea, but is so depressing compared to the rest of the album that it doesn\'t seem to fit so well with me.\n\nI also have some miscellaneous thoughts:\n\n- I have a personal hatred for instruments being panned hard to one side, sorry but I dock any album for this\n- Phil Selway\'s drumming is incredibly underrated\n- I am so incredibly desensitized by this album due to me playing it so much as a teenager. Most songs just don\'t hit it for me anymore as I think my taste has changed a lot.\n\nParanoid Android is my absolute favorite here. It was one of my favorites when I was younger and still is so awesome to me.\n\nI\'m going to give this a 4-star. I think that\'s the best I can give it.\n\nEDIT: I dropped this to a 3.5... I think it\'s essential to the genre, but it\'s not my thing.']",3.50 stars

There are some reasons for that but all of them are bad, eventually you could say it comes down to 15-year old me being an elitist punk and metalcore fan who would reject everything that\'s different. I remember asking somebody once: ""Why are all the albums that critics love bad?"" and thinking that Radiohead was about the highest stage of pretentiousness.\n\nSo that was me, and maybe if it hadn\'t been for my friend Heather, that would still be me. She almost forced me to listen to OK Computer, and after some weeks of not really wanting to I gave in.\n\nFirst I fell in love with ""No Surprises"" and ""Karma Police"". I didn\'t really get the rest of the album, but it had a certain fascination. I listened to it again soon after, when ""Karma Police"" happened to become the defining soundtrack in my life during the time of my proposal to my now fiancée.\n\nNow it seemed to make more sense to me and I liked it so much that I immediately ordered the CD. On several occasions I picked up the CD again, and grew to love song after song, the beautiful guitars in ""Lucky"", the amazing bridge of ""Paranoid Android"", then ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" after watching Black Mirror: Shut Up and Dance.\n\nNow, I don\'t think I would be able to tell why this album is so often considered the best album of all time, I just know that, in a way, when I listen to it, I feel it. This album has become an emotional rollercoaster for me. I don\'t even need to think about the lyrics (though they are great) and ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" fills me with melancholy, possibly the musically saddest song I have ever heard. The wonderful atmosphere of ""The Tourist"" has me hooked until the last second of the album.\n\nOK Computer is pretty much perfect and is a wonderful collage of different soundscapes and emotions, held together by Thom Yorke\'s beautiful voice and Jonny Greenwood\'s stunning guitar sounds.\n\nNow, if I would go back and tell 16-year old me that one day OK Computer will be one of my favourite albums I would probably tell myself to piss off.\n\nHighlights: Lucky, Karma Police, Exit Music (for a Film)']",5.00 stars
young_Padawan755,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I definitely get why OK Computer is objectively the greatest album of all-time (#1 on RYM). I think vocally, this is Radiohead\'s best album. Tracks like Airbag, Paranoid Android, and The Tourist exemplify that best. From a lyrical perspective, this album is frightening because most of us agree with what the album is saying. It shows themes of the future of technology, paranoia and isolation. There are a great selection of singles on here that were not shy on the charts.\n\nParanoid Android might be my favorite song on here as the song transitions from a more calm to aggressive periods. It eventually leads up to a very melancholic part of the song where the humming and vocals are soothing. Let Down sounds like it heavily influenced the 2000\'s alt-rock scene. I do like the song but do not think it is as great as people make it up to be. Karma Police samples a Beatles song, ""Sexy Sadie"" and makes great use of the sample. It is probably the most accessible song on the album and an amazing tune. I would say that I think there is a ""roadblock"" in OK Computer. That would be Electioneering which is usually agreed as the lowest quality song on OK Computer and Climbing Up the Walls which is probably my least favorite song if I had to pick one. I do think that both songs are still great though. The album ends beautifully with The Tourist. The song has an amazing vocal performance, beautiful hook, nice guitarwork and a great sense of finality for the roller coaster of emotions you just went through.', '']",5.00 stars

Banjos_Catalog,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'It\'s practically impossible to write about Radiohead\'s third album without addressing the massive amount of acclaim and hype spawned from its mere existence. By the time of its release, various critics and publications were already hailing it as an instant classic and were calling the band ""The Beatles of our generation."" That\'s quite a commendation, and on the surface it seems true, after all, both are English rock bands whose hit singles garnered them international fame and whose successful albums proved highly inspiring to countless artists of their generation, many of whom tried to imitate their style. Meanwhile, the band continued to experiment beyond their comfort zone and change up their sound amidst growing divisive opinions. But going beyond mere surface comparisons shows that the two groups are nothing alike at all. The Beatles primarily wrote cheery, catchy, almost simplistic rock songs about love and happiness alongside some fantastic covers of classic R&B tunes, while Radiohead are known for creating self-pity anthems and art-rock songs about anxiety, fear, fatalism, and other equally depressing themes. Also, The Beatles had each of the four members singing competently at some point and generally on their own song, while Radiohead are almost always reduced to one singer who\'s overly angst-ridden vocal performance often becomes too much to take in.\n\nWhy do I harp on this point so much? Well, it shows to my satisfaction just how unsophisticated and drone-like the consensus surrounding Radiohead is (ironic given their album that seeks to preach against such feeble-minded conformity) and represents part of why I find the constant comparisons made between the two bands and to Radiohead albums in general highly insufferable. Seriously, when I see ""reviews"" on this site that compare older albums to Pablo Honey (Dylan\'s self-titled debut) or Amnesiac (Rolling Stone\'s Tattoo You), I question why I even bother trying to skillfully articulate my opinions. It\'s obvious that dreary albums like OK Computer appeal to the majority of the RYM\'s demographic and I can understand why; Radiohead\'s art-rock influences lend an atmospheric quality to the music that evokes the most famous film soundtracks, which when combined with Yorke\'s sorrowful voice, resonates with the lonely, depressive, largely online types. But as a hardcore fan of song-form and traditional tunes, I find much of the album lacking enough engrossing sounds and interesting lyrics to justify its vapid Pink Floyd imitations.\n\nTo make my perspective on OK Computer as clear as possible, I will compose a track-by-track analysis of my thoughts while listening intently to the album:\n\nAirbag: I actually enjoy this opening track quite a bit. The flowing guitar riffs and DJ Shadow inspired drum delay succeed at establishing a somewhat inspiring mood right out of the gate. I also like how the structure of the lyrics help the song\'s pacing along nicely. Thom Yorke is certainly not the greatest rock singer in the world, but I will say his agonized voice delivers the message competently enough for the song to work. I\'m not as fond of the ending, with it\'s mundane background textures in place of engaging instrumentation, but it\'s not a deal-breaker.\n\nParanoid Android: A huge step down from the effective opener, this 6-and-a-half-minute-long track is a tedious mess of horrible lyrics, dreadful vocals and obnoxious distortion effects that fail to earn the comparisons to the classic rock anthems, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Happiness is a Warm Gun."" The song starts off fine enough, but only gets worse as it goes along, with Yorke\'s vocals morphing into the kind of whiny, adolescent pitch that made The Bends such a laborious record to sit through, and with his lyrics devolving into artsy babble that reads like he wrote them while drunk or sleep-deprived and never bothered to edit it after the fact. The unconventional structure only serves to make the music seem very unorganized and at times jarring, and the end result is very unsatisfying to listen to. But my biggest problem is that I just don\'t sympathize with Yorke\'s cynical disposition nor do I get much from his angsty vocal performance. Apparently, Yorke claims the title of the song is a joke and that the phrase, ""With your opinion/Which is of no consequence at all"" is one as well, and he\'s right, it is a joke, I just don\'t find it funny at all.\n\nSubterranean Homesick Alien: A homage to the classic Dylan tune in name only, this somber and moody track is one of the more entertaining parts of the album, mainly because Yorke\'s vocals are kept in check here and the guitars are consistently melodic. In terms of lyrical ability, Thom remains rather blunt and uncreative - ""They\'re all/Uptight/Uptight/Uptight/Uptight/Uptight/Uptight,"" goes the chorus. It\'s worth noting that the second verse ends with ""I\'m alright/Alright"" before reverting back to the chorus with, ""I\'m just/Uptight,"" which I guess is his way of proving he\'s somewhat self-aware. I think my biggest disconnect from this album so far comes from my lack of relatability to Yorke\'s ever-present theme of alienation, as reflected in the way he so condescendingly embraces his kinship with these hypothetical aliens over his human companions.\n\nExit Music (For a Film): A slower track which starts as a quiet acoustic guitar song, then adds some eerie vocal chants as background texture, before finally climaxing in a loud electronic wave of sound. The track\'s lyrical allusions to Romeo and Juliet feel largely unoriginal and the song itself feels a touch melodramatic in it\'s presentation, but I guess it\'s transition from quiet to loud accomplishes what it sets out to do well enough that I can\'t complain.\n\nLet Down: I love the arpeggio guitars and unique electronic rhythm and find Yorke\'s emotional performance on this song his best yet, but I\'ve begun to grow weary from his predictable metaphors (""I am gonna grow wings/A chemical reaction"" - it\'s a butterfly, get it!) and his seldom compelling way of detailing his boredom with modern life and technology (""Starting and then stopping/Taking off and landing/The emptiest of feelings"" - Yes, I\'ve felt exhausted having to wait on transportation too Thom).\n\nKarma Police: I\'ve gone back and forth on this one, initially hating it, then kinda liking it, and now I just feel very \'meh\' on it. I find its noisy, electronic coda incredibly annoying and feel like Yorke\'s attempt to imitate fascist, fun-hating censors make him sound as hollow and robotic as the people he\'s mocking. I also don\'t really feel anything from its deliberate deadbeat drumming other than a constant source of tedium. Not terrible, but also not captivating in the slightest.\n\nFitter Happier: In case ""Paranoid Android,"" ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" and ""Karma Police"" haven\'t already drilled the idea of humans-becoming-alienated-due-to-a-robotic-compliance-with-the-normalized-standard-of-living into your brain, here comes this dreary, monotonous, overtly dystopian, spoken-word track to hammer the beyond understood point home.\n\nElectioneering: The most abrasive guitar song on the album by far, here\'s where they kinda sorta pretend to act political in a rather slapdash send-up of election interference and ""voodoo economics."" It\'s like someone read a book about politics and was fascinated by several buzzwords and phrases, but couldn\'t figure out a way to write an intriguing song about the subject (to contrast, a superb example of a song that manages to convey its political message while remaining musically engaging is ""Washington Bullets"" by The Clash). The music itself might come across as a bit overblown and Yorke\'s screechy vocals might feel like overkill, but it does serve as a nice respite from the usual dreary nonsense.\n\nClimbing Up the Walls: Easily my least favorite track on the album. Featuring horrible production (loud, stale drums and a noisy assortment of effects including distorted vocals) and ridiculous lyrics (""I\'ve got the smell of a local man/Who\'s got the loneliest feeling"") attempting to personify \'paranoia,\' as well as fellow abstract concepts \'fear\' and \'anxiety,\' in an embarrassing effort at writing a \'scary\' song. And just to make things worse, it has another obnoxious electronic ending, one that sounds like several car horns layered on top of one another.\n\nNo Surprises:This calm, simple melody feels like a relief after the disaster of the previous track. The lyrics are more generic cynicism and fatalism that Yorke seems to believe are incredibly compelling and deep but that I find shallow and pretentious. At least the vocals are delivered clearly this time, albeit in a more robotic tone of voice (how ironic, or is it intentional?). ""Bring down the government/They don\'t/They don\'t speak for us,"" may sound like a bold political statement, but since in the context of the song it\'s just another fleeting thought in the mind of a suicidal depressive, it hardly counts. Also, ""Such a pretty house/And such a pretty garden,"" comes across as a meaningless jab at suburban housing and feels spiteful and bitter instead of relatable.\n\nLucky: The penultimate track, and the first of two largely tepid closing songs that fail to arouse my interest. A repeat of the near-death-experience-making-one-feel-invincible theme from the first track, only presented in a much less captivating way. Maybe if the lyrics were more engrossing, or at the very least not so full itself (although again maybe that is the point and I just don\'t get it), then I would like it more. Still, I find it difficult to care about - much less relate to - Yorke\'s disturbed personas, even with the gloomy guitar riffs providing a steady pace.\n\nThe Tourist: The final track, and what a bore it is, with lukewarm rhythms and another uninspired chorus (""Hey man/Slow Down/Slow Down""), which both add up to a dull finale to a mediocre album. The music can hardly sustain my attention at this point, and the vocals are nothing special. That\'s not even to mention what passes up for stale background fodder.\n\nIn summary, most of the album is competent musically, but the aurally satisfying moments are brought down by banal lyrics, subpar singing, annoying distortion, and dated electronic effects. As I have stated, I get why it appeals to so many on here. The simplified and direct lyrics, the electronically-infused art-rock tracks, the themes of isolation and paranoia, even the desperately angst-ridden vocals, all succeed at catering to the types of people who search for albums like OK Computer to make their sorrows feel more relatable and real. The point of this review isn\'t to say that others are wrong for liking this album, or even for believing it to be the greatest musical achievement in recent history. I simply want to make it clear that my dissatisfaction with the album comes not from it\'s massive popularity or critical outpouring (scornful as I may be of those who so routinely compare Radiohead to other artists, especially The Beatles), but rather from my disconnect with Yorke and his ideas.\n\nWhen I first heard the album, I\'ll admit, I did relate to it more, and thought I liked it enough to purchase it on iTunes, but I never saw it as the masterpiece the Internet hyped it up as. Having discovered many more gratifying and more relatable albums since then, I find little reason to return to Ok Computer\'s constant air of doom and gloom. Thom\'s angst just comes across as immature and whiny, and although Tom Verlaine doesn\'t have the nicest sounding voice either, his songs are usually more fun and meaningful and not as pathetically morose. I hope it\'s clear why I refuse to acknowledge this record as a classic or as a masterpiece and why it does little for me personally. If anything, I feel more confident in my opinion that Radiohead albums in general are overhyped and that they are nowhere near the level of mastery and musical pleasure that The Beatles possessed. And I shouldn\'t have to say this, but it is only my opinion, and I am no more \'correct\' than the countless reviews endlessly praising it are \'wrong.\'', '']",2.50 stars

Cass_Cole,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'In which Radiohead reaches the natural conclusion of their 1990s evolution. This might not be the best Alternative rock album ever, but it contains several of the best alternative rock songs ever, and its only real mistake is ending its runtime with its two weakest songs, which are still absolutely excellent. One album ago, they were among the bands defining the alternative sound on a really good but at times pedestrian album. Two albums ago, they were squirting out hot shit. It\'s obscenely impressive how fast and efficiently Radiohead evolved.\n\nWhat really makes this album so great is that it\'s the first, and maybe even the only one, in which each band member has massive influence on the sound, and yet even with their own separate sensibilities, every single idea on this album sounds like it came from the same obscenely talented person. On Pablo Honey, most of the music of the band was drowned out by overloud grunge guitar crunching. On some of the best parts of the Bends, bass, drums, piano, and less aggressive instrumentation and production provided a glimpse into some new layers of emotion and sound Radiohead were capable of. On this album, there isn\'t a track that doesn\'t contain bold and interesting drum and bass parts by Phil Selway and Colin Greenwood. There are few tracks that don\'t contain gorgeous piano and keyboards. Most of the tracks contain elements of Chris Greenwood\'s growing interest in classical orchestration. Thom Yorke\'s songwriting has reached its peak, his vocal delivery the most believable desperate howl you\'ve ever heard. The members of the guitar trio have all found their place--this album contains mystifying ""effects"" guitar by Ed O\'Brien, some of the best high-energy guitar solos I\'ve ever heard by Jonny Greenwood (especially on Paranoid Android and Electioneering), and incredibly evocative rhythm guitar by Thom Yorke. The overbearing crunch of grunge giotar production has disappeared completely, leaving bear for all to see a band of six supremely talented writer-musicians firing on all cylinders, and all in the exact same direction, homing in on one of the best albums ever recorded like desperate, deranged robots who\'ve just discovered emotion and inspiration.\n\nThere\'s a lot of variety on this album, not a single song sounds the same (except maybe Let Down and No Surprises), but they all sound like they\'re supposed to be together. Thematically, most of the songs explore burnout and the pressure of a young professional\'s life in the city, yet I find it better not to think of this as a Concept Album, exactly. It doesn\'t seem to be organized that way, and it doesn\'t need to be. This is just an album of Art/ernative Rock perfection that happened to be made while its lyricist was feeling exhausted, and using those feelings to great effect.\n\nAs I mentioned, the album\'s only flop is ending with its two weakest songs, Lucky and The Tourist. Both great songs, neither have album-ending energy, with Lucky having a good hook but being one of the least compositionally complex and instrumentally daring runtimes and with The Tourist being aetherially mellow and less thematically intriguing than any of the first 10 songs. Were it not for this track listing snafu, I could easily see the case for this being the best made album of all time.\n\nAnd what does a good band do after recording such an album? If they\'re truly great, they do something totally different. If they\'re truly great and legends, they do something totally different that\'s nonetheless on the level of an album like this one.\n\nRadiohead are legends.']",4.00 stars
TomWilliams77,"[""Yep, this is the big one. Whenever Radiohead come up in discussion, 9 times out of 10 it leads to talking about OK Computer. But does that make it the best Radiohead album?\n\nShort answer, no. As important as this album is to me, and to music generally, 'Climbing Up the Walls' is pretty forgettable and 'Fitter Happier' is sort of like an extended unnecessary interlude. Though I am a fan of 'Electioneering', this three track run on the second half sort of kills the momentum of the album.\n\nThat being said, you can't ignore the brilliance of this album, as much as some people may want to. Even on those three weaker songs, the production is immaculate and still feels completely timeless yet also as though it could have only come out in 1997.\n\nThat's as close as I'll come to bashing OK Computer. 'Airbag', 'Paranoid Android', 'Exit Music (For a Film)', 'Let Down' and 'No Surprises' are all perfect songs and would each be strong contenders to make a Radiohead top 10 list. That's without even mentioning the criminally underrated 'Lucky' and the previously underrated by me 'Karma Police'. My point is, even though this isn't my personal favourite Radiohead album, the songwriting here is the best it has ever been for the band, with one of the most eerie and brooding atmospheres ever put to an album to boot.\n\nThough full marks may seem generous based on my comments, this album is too important to me and to music today for me to give it any less. I can look past the slight issues with pacing on the back half because this really does play like a best-of for the most part.""]",5.00 stars

I was narrow minded and as I fell in love with this album and Radiohead I thought I had such good taste that was superior to others. I don\'t even know why I ever brought them up because my friends would just go ""I cant even name a song by them who are they"" or ""oh yeah creep is dope"" and the conversation would go nowhere.

Even Loveless I could understand being #1 more than this. But this? No. It sounds like a pretty standard alternative rock album to me with slight experimentation. Almost none of the riffs are interesting or creative. Thom Yorke's vocals get on my nerves. I don't like his weird vibrato and I don't particularly like his timbre. I mean I didn't expect to like this album but I didn't expect to dislike it this much. I also don't like how lethargic it is. This album has very few moments of energy. Also, one of my big issues with the album is just how gloomy it is. And it’s not that I don’t like any sad music. But this feels overly melancholic. It's not the type of melancholy where you can feel the sadness of the artist but the type where it just sounds dull and tedious. The whole thing just feels like a slog to get through. As for positives, Airbag had a cool intro riff and Paranoid Android has a cool riff at 2:22. The verses of Karma Police aren't bad. And there are other elements of a few songs that are decent. But overall, this is not made for me at all.

Wilky61,"['I\'m not really sure why this album is the #1 rated album on the website. I mean, yeah this album was pretty cool at the time I guess. I had the CD back then for my Sony Discman, and I guess I enjoy(ed) it more than their other first half-dozen albums. But at the end of the day, this is basically just 90s alt-rock. Ok sure, it\'s a weird prog-influenced offshoot of 90s alt-rock, but I don\'t think this album has aged tremendously well. (Contrast this against In Rainbows, which never expects to age.) And OK Computer is neither as catchy nor as deep as the Flaming Lips\' masterpiece The Soft Bulletin from about the same period. So I can\'t elevate this beyond the level of a ""pretty good"" 3/5\n\nHighlights: Paranoid Android (this song is a bit uneven, however, with the eerie acoustic first half dominating the abrasive, electric second half); the slow-burning, climactic Exit Music For a Film; the catchy Karma Police (IMO their signature song over Creep); the avant-garde jazzy Climbing Up the Walls (no track on this album has grown on me more over time than this one); and the one-two gut punch at the end Lucky / The Tourist\n\nSo that\'s a fair number of highlights. At the end of the day, this is a good album -- I would say my 2nd favorite Radiohead album overall, but Thom Yorke\'s shrill voice has always grated on my eardrums, and large sections of this album are just abrasive and ugly. Take ""Airbag"" for instance. I guess this is supposed to be a fan favorite(?) but it\'s possibly my least favorite track on the album after you throw out Fitter Happier (if not the overly jangly Electioneering... actually yeah I think Electioneering is worse / unlistenable). I just think the guitar intro to ""Airbag"" is ugly, and Thom Yorke\'s vocals are decidedly whiny on this track (it kinda reminds me of ""Fake Plastic Trees,"" which is not only the worst Radiohead song I\'ve ever heard but probably in my top three most hated songs of all-time). Even one of my favorite tracks ""Climbing Up the Walls"" has that awful 30 seconds of distortion at the end of the track.\n\nSo I\'m not really a fan.

voodoo_chiile,"['I remember seeing Radiohead videos on MTV in the mornings before school. Anxiously waiting for the lyrics “I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul.” to make me feel ok not being ok, not being cool. Than I saw the time in which True Love Waits would finally be studio recorded.\n“And true love waits\nIn haunted attics\nAnd true love lives\nOn lollipops and crisps”\nThose lyrics reminding us of the horrific places love lingers in our minds and why it’s important. Why we can never become strong enough to not let love hurt us again, years and years after love appears to have lost its relevance. Finally learning that it cannot keep us safe from the bunkers of war, but somehow that doesn’t really matter because it exists “on lollipops and crisps.” Like some kind of literal fairy tale. But we’re not here to talk about those songs. I stole OK Computer. It was my first Radiohead album. I was in the fits of active addiction. A friend of many years said I could borrow it. I was homeless. I had a Sony Discman tho. I played this record non-stop. It was terrifying. But I never gave it back. I would never get the chance to either. I did tell her I took it. She told me the album was written with me in mind. I deserved it. It was mine. The cacophonous thundering of Paranoid Android sounded like my brain after returning from Iraq. I felt so much like that Paranoid Android. The Karma Police were coming to get me for my crimes against humanity. Why I did it was hauntingly familiar in Fitter Happier. No Surprises has a surreal effect, making me ok with whatever is coming down the pipe. I would later learn that after OK Computer was released Radiohead went on tour and all of their equipment was stolen. Everything In It’s Right Place, tuned and orchestrated to it’s precise calibration. Stowed, cared for and untouched. None of the equipment could be easily replaced. They had to cancel the tour because everything was tuned to everything else and so difficult to match. Computers, synths, guitars, wires and robot machinery. Bill Gates probably couldn’t figure it out. I suppose that’s similar to my abduction of the record from Abby.

Perhaps they\'re a little too precisely performed, but I can\'t complain.""\n\nWell, there\'s a little more to it than that. Unlike Sgt. Pepper, which has very little connecting the songs, OK Computer is more thematically and musically consistent, expressing a very specific kind of millennial angst which has aged very well. The eclecticism feels very well-balanced, never veering off into excess nor being unable to sustain the entire experience. The songs themselves? All good, though the second half is a definite step down. Unlike latter-day Radiohead, Thom is actually interested in writing coherent melodies (which lose a bit of their potency being delivered by his nigh-incomprehensible caterwaul), some of which actually end up foregrounding themselves (""Let Down"").\n\nThe way I talk about this album sounds like I hate it, but that\'s not true at all. Each song has something unique to offer, and though the lyricism is vague (it\'s Radiohead after all), it doesn\'t slip into laziness anywhere near as much as their latter projects, sometimes even being quite compelling.

Yata,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Radiohead are probably the one band that has changed the most within my conscious over these past years of musical exploration, exploitation, and reinvestment. I\'ve gone from hating just about every album they\'ve made to loving every single album the band has released more than any other, except for one. Yes, this is a review of that one album. That one album happens to be what has been hailed as the greatest album of the last two decades by, literally, thousands of critics and fans alike. So why don\'t I enjoy this? What is there to blame?\n\nWell, the reasons are lost. I don\'t know why. I never knew why. I can\'t really say that it is this band\'s smugness that turns me off. I managed to completely love The Bends for months upon months without ever catching on to how horribly pretentious and annoying it was. It isn\'t the acclaim either, though I adored Amnesiac for being a \'mistake\' album. I also absolutely loved Kid A which falsifies both of these reasons\' likelihood. It\'s not the art rock atmosphere that this provides, as In Rainbows is an absolutely glorious piece. It isn\'t even that I prefer their more electronic side, Pablo Honey has gained love for being simplistic. I still enjoy every album in some shape or form as well, so it\'s not as if I\'ve grown out of any of them. It is more that the albums reflect a place and time in life, and I think that OK Computer expresses my complete ignorance within the vast universe of musical landscapes and monuments.\n\nI didn\'t understand the album upon first listen. Hell, how was I supposed to? It\'s completely alien to my mind circa 2007. I had no idea who Radiohead were or why everybody loved them so much. I hadn\'t heard any of those enormous Art Rock names. The Velvet Underground. King Crimson. David Bowie. I only actually knew Radiohead by how everyone else my age knew them: ""Creep"". Of course, I listened to Pablo Honey first. This is the time where I loved the album most. I listened to The Bends and already felt that they were growing as a band. And at the time, that was a scary idea. I mean, here is this 13 year old kid that loved Black Sabbath when they played ""Paranoid"". AC/DC when they played with Bon Scott. Metallica when they had Cliff. Change was scary. And I hated OK Computer because of this.\n\nBut what was weird was that I didn\'t hate the later albums as much. Kid A made me feel smart. Amnesiac made me feel dumb. Hail to the Thief reminded me of The Bends so I went back and listened to that a few more times and ended up replacing Pablo Honey as my favorite album by Radiohead.\n\nAnd with time, I really did manage to warm up to a few songs from this album, mostly thanks to the guidance of fellow RYM members. ""Let Down"" quickly rose as being my favorite song of all time. I was reading through reviews of this album on day and saw someone (the name escapes me) noting the absolute angelical of a keyboard arpeggio in ""Let Down"". Naturally, I went and investigated, not remembering anything of the sort before. And my mind was blown. I actually paid attention to what was happening in this album and discovered why people thought it to be so great. I tried doing so with other songs, but that proved to be more difficult. I set it aside once more, but decided to investigate Kid A\'s tracks as well. I was blown away once more.\n\nI\'ll fast-forward past my Amnesiac days, which I believe are aptly covered within my review of that album already. We\'ll send myself to the present, actually. What I am listening to right now. ""Airbag"" has revealed itself recently as being a cornerstone. A connecting link between the predecessor and the successor. Between The Bends and OK Computer. The guitars feature the same crashingly raw and unrestrained power behind the likes of ""The Bends"" and ""My Iron Lung"", but also have sonic experimentation that Radiohead had begun to explore throughout this album. Not only that, but the drumming is much more dynamic and exciting to hear now. The tones aren\'t quite the electronic bang and clang that Kid A is stuffed to the brim with, but is more of a contemporary style, with that electronic overdub slipped in. Just for fun. Thom\'s vocals took on their new, now-familiar, delicate tonality. The frailness and openness that makes Radiohead a brilliant band. The worth that ""Airbag"" has as an opener has finally been revealed to me.\n\nAnd really, what keeps me coming back to this album time after time and leaving me disappointed more and more. Not because it is a bad song. Of course not. That\'s ridiculous. ""Paranoid Android"" has long since become my choice as the greatest song this band has ever conjured. The guitars and drums ripple and intermix so effortlessly and frighteningly that the atmosphere rivals that of the complex and deep ambiance that Kid A drowns in so easily. ""Paranoid Android"" is pretty awesome, need it even be said? Thom\'s vocals reach all the highs you can imagine, and still manage to graze the edges of the lows. ""Paranoid Android"" proves Thom Yorke\'s worth as a vocalist. Completely. And then all the build-up near the middle always leaves me wondering when Thom\'s gonna explode. And then it just... happens. The guitar reverts to the most primal moment of Radiohead\'s entire career, and then the tremolo picking to bust open the solo maintains its position as my favorite part of any Radiohead song. In comes the eerie, ambient moaning. The aesthetics of the song shift so suddenly and violently that this new atmosphere is frighteningly alien and abstract.\n\nWhich segues very nicely into the next song on this journey. ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" pays homage to Bob Dylan, of course, but is nothing like Bob Dylan in actuality. Bob Dylan\'s severely old-fashioned and guitar-driven. It\'s hard to imagine that anything in this song is guitar at all. It is all very electronic and different from your run-of-the-mill rock music. The guitar tone does rear its head eventually, but its sound is still very much enveloped in this new and different sound. Something Radiohead haven\'t ever truly done before now. This song has always been difficult for me, but now it has managed to force me to actually hold back tears of joy. That is a truly rare quality of music.\n\nAnd Radiohead take another sharp turn. ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is entirely somber and sulky. ""Sulk"" never even got like this. ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" still had a sense of pop optimism within itself. But this is just drainingly depressive. Just one of those songs that just sit staring at your music player. Stunned. Silenced. Kind of gives you the chills, maybe. The soundscape is much more subtle this time around as well, or Thom\'s voice is just far more prominent. The lyrics are impossibly hard to decipher on the first go, or even the twentieth. There exists a sense of deprivation and loss within them, but the actual cohesion of language is lost in Thom\'s tortured performance and delivery of them.\n\n""Let Down"" returns to familiarity and comfort. A sort of breather from these heavy-set and revolutionary rounds of songs. Bright, twanging guitars and a bit more up-tempo Thom vocal deliveries. An identifiable refrain as well, and the drums have fallen back into a relative state of simplicity. The soundscapes have fallen away and have become once more little more than a wall of guitars. ""Let Down"" has a soothing quality to it, if anything. A mellowing, chill-out song. The existence of that arpeggio is almost lost within the lulling waves of guitar lapping before it comes right up and hits you with its miraculous beauty. 3:30 in, if you are as curious as I was when I first took a listen.\n\nNow, for the puzzling song that proceeded ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"". The song I never understood the acclaim and love of. The striking piano introduction being blasted into the background by the bass drum, which accompanies the vocal\'s arrival as well. ""Kaaaaarmaaa Poooliiice, arrest this maaan he talks in maths.."" Those subtle, choral vocals during the refrain, and how absolutely dissolved and exposed Thom\'s voice presents itself here. As the song signifies its ending with that now-familiar drone of electronic experimentation, it acts as a forewarning to what is to come.\n\nPossibly the strangest song Radiohead ever released, ""Fitter Happier"" is hard to follow and thoroughly robotic and heartless. Going from such an aggressive onslaught of emotional waterfalls and tidal waves, hearing the drone and monotone of a robot\'s voice is completely alienating and scary.\n\nThe calming return of an ""Airbag""-esque guitar twang is a refresher. The sleigh bells give way to the cowbells, and the guitars peak in their distortion, and Thom\'s voice introduces itself again. Here, though, Thom is donning a different mask. One more of political frustration and rage, rather than what has always been a calm, if mournful, demeanor. His vocals begin to swirl around quickly and become something of wonder and awe.\n\nWhere this sheer, unrestrained power goes by the next song will forever remain a mystery. ""Climbing Up the Walls"" codas ""Exit Music (For a Film)"", as well as ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"". With both being brilliant songs that approach the same branch of musical mindset and aesthetic, it is no surprise that ""Climbing Up the Walls"" is the song that hits every right note. That is legitimately beautiful in how barren and deserted everything about the sound feels. The solemn, pounding drums along with the contrastingly weakened guitar, electronic, and Thom tones. The double-layering vocals, one featuring Yorke\'s normal range, that high falsetto, with an absolutely different and distant low-ranging set of vocals in addition to that. The creeping, waning electronic soundscaping fits into your mind the idea of something grasping onto life. Just barely alive. Striving to be more.\n\nNothing more majestic truly exists for Radiohead. Acoustic strumming provides the soundscape for once, with the electronic soundscape instead moving into the foreground, providing that twinkling chimes of ""No Surprises"". Thom almost seems to be singing backwards. It\'s a strange world that Thom is in while singing this, only truly being able to coherently pronounce the chorus of ""no surprises"". It\'s a tear-jerking ballad, truly.\n\nThen silence.\n\nThen screaming.\n\nThen ""I wanna run. I wanna ruuuuuuuun"". Scraping soundscape fills the void of emptiness just enough to be eerie. The flick of acoustic guitar enters in, followed by a set of electric guitar distortion, which all just preludes the track opening up and being the full, room-filling sound that creeps up only routinely. The sounds quickly fall back into the silence, only the build-up has taken root. Everything is more powerful. Anticipation builds for the return of that power, and ""Lucky"" can\'t help but sound like a more adventurous ""Creep"". Strip away the acoustic guitar that ""Creep"", replace it with a solitary electronic sound, then take away the heavily distorted chorus and add in that room-breaking sound. What have you now? ""Lucky"". A reinvention of the past, but a proof that Radiohead truly did care about Pablo Honey and what it did.\n\nAnd now. The final song. The closer. This has always been the hardest song for me to comprehend. ""The Tourist"" is scores of people\'s favorite song from here, or one of their favorites. But, if not for ""Fitter Happier"", I think I would pick ""The Tourist"" as the weakest song here. IT doesn\'t quite hit home as hard as ""Lucky"", and doesn\'t have the build-up and release of it either. ""The Tourist"" is more a meeting of the two words of songs like ""Lucky"" and songs like ""Exit Music (For a Film)"". It\'s pretty, but uninteresting at the same time. Almost a confused sound. A sound that Radiohead finally will discover and capitalize three years following. Yes, Kid A.\n\nIf this even need be said, OK Computer has finally opened up its petals. Has finally revealed the sweet nectar of lust and glory that every music critic has given it and appraised it for. The circle has been completed. From Pablo Honey to The Bends to Kid A to In Rainbows to Amnesiac to Hail to the Thief, and finally to OK Computer. The torch has been passed to its final holder.

TheWeirdhat,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'In 1993, Radiohead released Pablo Honey, an average rock/grunge album that wasn\'t anything special. In 1995, they released The Bends, which was easily superior to Pablo Honey and a huge step up for the band. Little did they know when writing OK Computer, the album they\'d release in 1997, they\'d change music. While The Bends took the boundaries of music and stretched them, OK Computer just straight up disregarded them. It is the sound this album created that became a strong influence on many other artists.\n\nI felt it fitting to open up this review in a similar manner to my review on The Bends because the jump from Pablo Honey to OK Computer was unlike we had seen in almost any other band. In only 4 years, they went from being ""That Creep band that some people know about but have only heard a couple songs from at most"" to one of the greatest bands of all time.\n\nThe first aspect of the album that should be noted is how grim and dark it is. From the very first guitar on ""Airbag"" to the final ding on ""The Tourist"", the album portrays alienation, anxiety, and dread. In some cases, the instrumentals themselves are enough to sell this point. On my personal favorite track on the album, ""Climbing Up the Walls"", the dark instrumentals and anxious string arrangements all lead up to one final explosion, as if the song is screaming out in horror and pain with guitars and strings and all. Other tracks, however, follow the very \'Radioheadish\' tradition of pretending to be ok or even joyful when in reality, that is far from the truth. ""No Surprises"" sounds pleasant with its calm and almost refreshing guitars and instrumentals, but when you look at the lyrics, you will see that it seems to represent giving up, and in a rather depressing way too. Meanwhile, the interlude ""Fitter Happier"" involves a mechanical voice speaking over some dreary, dreadful, and somber piano. It describes the ideal citizen, someone who is ""Fitter, happier, more productive, etc."" whereas it seems obvious after some time that this is not how life should truly be. As ideal citizens, all different copies of seemingly the same person, they are living a lie. When living like that, there\'s no way to truly be happy. ""Subterranean Homesick Alien,"" meanwhile, takes a slight break from these dark and paranoid themes and instead focuses on alienation. Through echoey guitars and soft drums, it explains this feeling of homesickness and loneliness.\n\nThe instrumentals on this album are stunning. The nervous-but-open atmosphere of the tracks is very well achieved, and in a different way with each track. Songs like ""Exit Music"" and ""Climbing Up the Walls"" start off slow or quiet, but you can tell from the get go that something\'s not right. Over the course of the tracks, they build to a climax full of energy and then fade back out quietly, as if mute whispers are all that remain of them. ""Exit Music"" is one of the most anxious tracks whereas ""Climbing Up the Walls"" is downright horrifying. Meanwhile, the masterpiece of an epic that is ""Paranoid Android"" has multiple different sections all packed into one song, movements that flow and fit together. It also includes some of Jonny\'s best guitar freakouts and still follows through with the paranoid atmosphere(thus, why the song\'s name is extremely fitting). ""Electioneering"" is more straightforward and doesn\'t really settle well with most, but I quite like it. It\'s driven on strongly by immense energy and loud, powerful guitars, as well as some excellent riffs in the ending portion of the song. The distorted drums and varying guitars on ""Airbag"" add a unique atmosphere to it that opens the album perfectly, with electronic noises and airy guitars mixed with a heavier distorted beat paired with electric guitars. ""Let Down"" is another track that seems happy but is actually quite grim. It really helps to drive home the point of a false sense of security with its joyful drums and pleasant guitar, a cunning mask for its truly sullen lyrics. Meanwhile, ""Karma Police"" represents how unique people who do not follow everyone else in their way of living(perhaps the way of living described in ""Fitter Happier"") are treated poorly and how individuality is hard to keep. The pairing of guitar and piano makes for a great aesthetic. ""Lucky"" has some evident Pink Floyd influence, and it makes for one hell of a track. The calm, eerie quiet of the first verse leading into the chorus, with Thom belting out the lyrics as guitars scream and swell behind him is sublime and pairing the song with ""The Tourist"" to close the album works perfectly. ""The Tourist"" itself is an amazing song, slow and quiet until the chorus explodes with energy. It\'s as if the song is desperately screaming for everyone to ""slow down."" The final guitar riffs are once again perfectly fitting for the song and sound marvelous. These two songs help OK Computer go out with a bang of epic proportions, an ending that you can\'t help but remember, closing out with one final Ding!\n\nWhile it\'s only my 3rd favorite Radiohead album, the fact that they got from Pablo Honey, the generic rock album, to OK Computer, an alt rock masterpiece full of unique soundscapes in just 4 years blows me away. The weaker tracks are still amazing, and even the interlude does a damn-near flawless job at representing the album. I couldn\'t have asked for anything more and it still remains clear to me why some people say that it is the greatest album of all time.']",5.00 stars
Walter12,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Although every decade since the 1970\'s has produced fewer classic records than each of its predecessors, the absolute best of the 90\'s are on par with the masterworks of any era. In fact, there appears to be a growing consensus of critical praise toward the more ambitious side of the decade\'s alternative and indie rock movements: an Indian summer of creativity that exploited increased studio accessibility to (temporarily) cut through the overly commercialized nature of the music industry. Standing at the absolute pinnacle of arty alternative rock excellence is Radiohead\'s OK Computer. This is a latter-day classic that is fully deserving of all the praise, even when that praise rivals the adoration bestowed upon the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and company. I won\'t pretend that it\'s my all-time favorite album, or that it\'s somehow beyond reproach, but it\'s a seminal release that any serious music fan immediately needs to acquire.\n\nThousands of pages have already been written about OK Computer, and I have little to add about the record\'s overall sound. Suffice it to say that the album is filled with slow-burning alternative rock, and that it manages to sound thoroughly ""modern"" despite the fact that traditional rock instrumentation is given at least as much space as synth experimentation. A perfect marriage of old and new that is unrelated to the contemporaneous post-rock movement but succeeds for many of the same reasons. I\'ll also note that, while OK Computer frequently draws comparisons to the subsequent Kid A, it\'s equally easy to characterize it as a natural extension of the more deliberate tracks off The Bends. OK Computer is still distinctly less ""alternative rock sounding"" than its immediate predecessor, meaning that listeners who aren\'t already alternative rock fans should have better luck with the synth-dominated Kid A, but everybody who likes OK Computer should give both of those surrounding albums an honest try.\n\nPersonally, I\'d rank OK Computer as one of the best sounding records in my entire collection. The sound production here is absolutely stunning, and special kudos goes to producer Nigel Godrich and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood for squeezing the most out of every melody. Thom Yorke is also at the height of his game, delivering the best collection of vocal melodies in his career. As readers of my reviews are undoubtedly aware, I usually don\'t fixate on the lyrical content of albums, but OK Computer is a big exception. A perfect encapsulation of cynicism in the information age. My only significant stylistic complaint about the record is that Yorke occasionally crosses the line from emotive to needlessly melodramatic. This is especially true on ballads like ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" or ""The Tourist"", whose operatic choruses provide plenty of ammunition for those who enjoy deriding Radiohead for Yorke\'s ""whiny"" singing. At 53-minutes, the album is also 5-10 minutes longer than it really needs to be, but it\'s remarkably restrained for its era and rarely sounds overlong while you\'re actually listening to it. Minor criticisms for a record that does almost everything right.\n\nOK Computer still wouldn\'t be nearly as fantastic if it wasn\'t for a superlative collection of underlying tunes. I hear three stone-cold classics in ""Paranoid Android"", ""Karma Police"", and ""No Surprises"", the first of which is arguably one of the best (and most inventive) alternative rock tracks of all time. The remainder of the album is filled with stellar deep cuts, many of which would have qualified as standouts on any other Radiohead record. However, my opinions about these tracks differ slightly from the norm. I\'m not nearly as sour on ""Electioneering"" as many hardcore fans, although I\'ll admit that it\'s guitar-driven melody would\'ve sounded more at home on The Bends. Whether or not you love ""Electioneering"" should be a good indicator of whether you\'ll place The Bends in the same league as OK Computer (I do). I\'ve also never particularly warmed to either ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" or ""The Tourist"". I wouldn\'t classify either of those latter selections as mediocre, but they\'re both extremely slow and I\'m repeatedly turned off by the aforementioned dose of melodrama. If you ignore ""Fitter Happier"", that means that nine out of the eleven tracks on OK Computer are excellent. And that\'s one hell of a ratio that\'s only matched by a handful of records in my collection.\n\nOK Computer is an obvious 5.0-star record that rivals Siamese Dream (Smashing Pumpkins) as my favorite release of the 90\'s. If you absolutely love what you hear on this album, also be sure to check out the associated Airbag EP, which is significantly less stunning but includes six leftovers from the same studio sessions.\n\n9.4/10']",5.00 stars
OhSh,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Instead of straightforward themes and guitar-work typical of the early 90’s, on OK Computer, Radiohead opted for abstract lyrical content and glitchy instrumentation. Although I\'m not the biggest rock listener, this is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I don\'t think it\'s #1 per say, but it\'s one of the first albums I listened to and I definitely understand the hype.\n\nThis change in direction for Radiohead can be heard immediately in the first track, “Airbag”. The lack of clarity in the lyrics can be observed by reading the first lines on the album – “In the next world war, in a jackknifed juggernaut, I am born again”. These lyrics are an allusion to Thom Yorke’s car accident (and the ""airbag” that saved his life). The glitchy instrumentation can be heard in the drum pattern throughout and the sound effects in the second half of the song. This was an amazing opener, and just a very sentimental track in the Radiohead discography.\n\nAn aspect of Radiohead’s music that remains unchanged from their previous records are the saddening lyrical settings and instrumentals. Some moments on this album are incomparably melancholic and hopeless. Among them include the emotional climax at the end of “Exit Music (For a Film)”, the third switch-up on “Paranoid Android”, and the chorus of “Lucky”. In addition, “Fitter Happier” is an unusual interlude-type track near the middle of the album, with a text-to-speech voice stating various daily tasks of many people in a saddening fashion, accompanied by off-putting sound-effects and piano. It was an unxpected highlight depsite the lack of vocals from Thom.\n\nThere are tracks on this album that take a different approach to mood as well. Many tracks have contrasting lyrical and instrumental moods – for example, “Airbag”, “No Mistakes”, and “Let Down”. The instrumentals for the first two are both melancholic and cheerful at different parts, but the lyrical content is completely hopeless. They explore themes of death, suicide, and pessimism, respectively.\n\n“Subterranean Homesick Alien” and “The Tourist” are noteworthy because of their spacey and laid-back instrumentals. The slow and jazzy instrumentals of both compliment the lyrical themes. In “The Tourist”, the chorus of “hey man, slow down” is meant to symbolize how some people (tourists as a synecdoche here) move in life too quickly. “Subterranean Homesick Alien’s” themes of isolation are also complimented by the slow, gloomy instrumental.\n\nThe guitar solos on this album are also notable. “Paranoid Android” contains a guitar solo near the middle that is chaotic and suits the tone of the song amazingly, but the best solo on this album is easily the one at the end of “The Tourist”. The high tones are very emotive and are a great way to conclude the album.\n\nAlthough I love much of this album, there remain uninteresting moments – Namely the unadventurous and uninteresting instrumental of “Let Down” – that has not aged well. “Let Down”, has some things to like, including the touches of synth at the end, but this track has always sounded like it could be in a commercial. It’s a little too easy-going for my taste, and I’ve always felt the lyrics don’t portray insincerity and disappointment as well as they intend to.\n\n""Climbing Up the Wall"" has a cool, eerie mood and nice instrumental embellishments in the last part of the track. However, it’s nothing special in my opinion compared to the rest of the record.\n\n“Electioneering” is the worst track on OK Computer, in my opinion. Although it’s livelier than “Let Down”, it also sounds like generic commercial music. It feels very out of place in the tracklist because of how straightforward and tireless it is. The lyrical themes on this album are relatively nuanced, but there’s really no layers to peel back here. Overall, this song is just a bore.\n\nAlthough I am not as praiseworthy of it as most rock fans, I still love OK Computer. If you enjoy adventurous instrumentals, abstract lyricism, and want to listen to a more melancholic rock record, then I recommend this album. Even if you are not a fan of rock music, this is a great-entry point. Strong recommendation.', '']",4.00 stars

Rapthoughtworld,"['OK Computer is an artistic statement. It took the dying soul of rock music and did something completely new with it. And although I think it is in part, along with Kid A, responsible for the massively diminished prominence of rock in the mainstream, I feel it elevated the genre as an artform. OK Computer forms a truly powerful and forward-thinking narrative about the state of the modern world and the looming, and inevitable, threat of technology as a means of division among people. The album is soaked in anxiety, paranoia, and isolation; the themes are perfectly built in its instrumentation and Thom\'s high-pitched lamenting vocals. Paranoid Android is the best Radiohead song to date, it\'s the artsy music fan\'s Bohemian Rhapsody, but it tells a much more powerful story with the ending segment standing out as one of the most harrowing yet beautiful moments in music. Let Down and Exit Music are two of the best vocal performances of all time; they add massively to the songs\' impressive writing and instrumental structure turning these from great to all-time great tracks. The finale in The Tourist is just so fitting with Thom belting to ""slow down"" a insightful warning to a frantic and rapidly declining world. OK Computer is a true masterpiece.']",4.50 stars

Kid A is the most innovative album out of these three, In Rainbows is the most diverse one and OK Computer is the most consistent one. And not only that OK Computer is the most consistent Radiohead album, it also features their best songs ever, simply Radiohead at their best.\n\nEvery song in this album is great. Paranoid Android delivers powerful moments with hard-rocking guitars along with touching moments as this song has a unique structure. Exit Music (For a Film) gives me goose pimples at the end of the song every time I hear it, partly because the first time I heard this song was in Black Mirror. Airbag opens the album with a very optimistic vibe and is more unique and complex than any song on The Bends, showing the listener that OK Computer is not just another simple album. Another great song from this album is Climbing Up The Walls which is the true underrated song in this album, an emotional song that explodes in the end. And You cant forget the most well-known quote from the music industry; ""For a minute there I lost myself"", from Karma Police which is one of the best moments in this album.\n\nI can keep talking about the songs but that\'s not my point in this review. All of the songs are great on their own, but it\'s their compilation that creates this masterpiece, as all of the songs while being very different have a common vibe, that I can\'t really explain well, but it\'s those little electronic touches in each song combined with Jonny Greenwood\'s electric guitar. This vibe, integrated in each song, creates the sound of OK Computer. Listening to this album in it\'s order really gets the best out of each song, for example Fitter Happier, is not a song that you will enjoy listening on its own, but it feels just right in the mood between Karma Police and Electioneering.\n\nAnother thing about this album, is that it ages really well, which is not something that you can say about a lot of albums, and the more I listen to this album the more I like it, this album grew on me slowly.\n\nOK Computer is truly a masterpiece and an essential album for every music listener. 5/5']",5.00 stars

Well...unfortunately, yeah, that\'s what this album is mostly about among other things.\n\n""The emptiest of feelings\nDisappointed people clinging on to bottles\nAnd when it comes it\'s so, so disappointing\nLet down and hanging around\nCrushed like a bug in the ground""\n\n""Shell smashed, juices flowing\nWings twitch, legs are going\nDon\'t get sentimental\nIt always ends up drivel\nOne day I am gonna grow wings\nA chemical reaction\nHysterical and useless""\n\n""A heart that\'s full up like a landfill\nA job that slowly kills you\nBruises that won\'t heal\nYou look so tired, unhappy\nBring down the government\nThey don\'t, they don\'t speak for us\nI\'ll take a quiet life\nA handshake of carbon monoxide\nAnd no alarms and no surprises""\n\nNevermind how crazy the instrumental work and Thom\'s bleeding vocals sound the closest to perfection any band or solo musician has ever attempted to reach.\n\nOne important thing to note is that if you love this album, then I urge you to listen to the OKNOTOK 1997 2017 re-release version. You\'re really missing out on an equally amazing collection of B-sides and previously-unreleased songs from the band\'s recording sessions around OK Computer\'s original release. My goodness, I Promise, Man of War and Lift are all equally gorgeous!']",5.00 stars

Every song on here is fantastic, with about half of them ranking in my Top 200 songs of all time or so.

All the tracks have great diversity, amazing melodies and absoloutely gorgeous textures which have stayed fresh after all these years, so it's not like it doesn't deserve that score. The themes of disillusionment in society is still relevant to this day, and this album is genuinely timeless. Maybe it's just because it's such a popular album and I like to pretend I'm cool. The only complaint I can really make is that Thom Yorke's diction is horrible in places, but its not that often, and the instrumentation backing the vocals up are interesting enough to carry the songs.

dl_dl_dl,"['So here it is; Radiohead\'s 1997 album, OK Computer, a delve into the mind of the modern man, and artistic turning point for the band.\n\nAnd what a turning point it was. Radiohead pre OKC was a patchwork of grungy 90s rock clichés, but with some pretty good ideas on The Bends, many of which hinted at what was to come. Radiohead post OKC is experimental, cerebral, and altogether strange rock music, and it was OK Computer that allowed that huge leap to happen. It was here that Radiohead began to truly flex their muscles, and the real talent of the band finally came through.\n\nAs such, it\'s significance cannot be overstated. It\'s quality, however, can. And has been. Repeatedly. Enough times to last a lifetime. A glance at this albums critical reception tab on Wikipedia will show a 10/10 from Pitchfork, a 10/10 from NME, and a host of 4 to 5 stars. Writer Tim Footman, who apparently loved OK Computer to write an entire book about it, noted that: ""Not since 1967, with the release of Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, had so many major critics agreed immediately, not only on an album\'s merits, but on its long-term significance, and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history."" High praise indeed.\n\nFirst, let\'s talk about themes. Yorke writes about dissolusionment with modern life, depression, mundanity, frustration at politics, and boredom. I imagine Yorke was reading a lot of Philip Larkin at the time, a poet who I would whole-heartedly reccomend to anyone who enjoys the lyrical themes of the album. The instrumentals also tie in very nicely, being loaded with glitchy bleeps, robot voices, and ethereal soundscapes, and I will admit, not many albums do this to the degree that OK Computer does. The theme of boredom, however, is the one that prevails the most in the instrumentals, because it\'s exactly how the album makes the listener feel.\n\nSecond, the tracks. It blows it\'s load in the first half, with Paranoid Android and Exit Music providing some much needed excitement that isn\'t found again until Electioneering, a track that, along with No Suprises, which its suitably chilling, artificial sounding melody, just about saves the second half from complete mediocrity. The rest is just padding.\n\nOK Computer is yet another case where contextual significance gets confused with quality.']",3.00 stars
Dayvenkirq,"['_______________________________________________________\n\nI\'ll try to keep it short and sweet.\n\nThoughts:\n\n1) Glorification in reviews without specific points in sound defense of a recording can be irritating.\n\n2) I\'m not a huge Radiohead fan, though I don\'t think they are overrated. (""Overrated"" is just another way of saying ""Why can\'t we all like the same things?"")\n\n3) (Edit: Here I scratched out the part where I say that I don\'t think OK Computer is overrated. I just don\'t understand the album. That\'s right, call me confused.) If you think this album is the greatest thing since sliced bread, that\'s perfectly fine. I can accept that. Shit, my nutty, idiotic head thinks Crimso\'s Starless And Bible Black is the greatest rock album ever made in spite of its flaws. ""No album is perfect,"" Thom Yorke once remarked on music as an art form in an interview upon the release of OK Computer. Good riddance. At least he knows.\n\n4) This album opens with a character-less avant-garde-ish riff complemented with a character-less clean guitar melody. Then they add character-less beats. In the middle they throw in character-less sounds. This is not what I understand as passion. (I really don\'t have the will to go deeper into the opener.)\n\n5) ""Paranoid Android"" is supposedly inspired by Pink Floyd and Queen. That\'s just trivia to me; I could care less. The song comes in sections, but that\'s also rendered a trivia. It starts off with an OK-flamenco riff, followed by unconvincing ascending-descending tunes sung with an unconvincing voice, goes into boring 7/8 bars (can\'t really say the electric piano was a fitting choice), continues into a loud section ... it all just sounds like sonic information. This is not what I understand as forward-thinking mentality or passion either. (At least the melodically similar but more subdued ""Knives Out"" fares well in terms of mood thanks to the clever choice of chords and chord changes.) Cherry on top: these guys had the sack to claim that the song was conceived as a joke. I really don\'t know how to peacefully meet something that I found to be fake modesty. At what point in the history of human civilization did we start genuinely enjoying novelty music? (But if it\'s something satirical like We\'re Only In It For The Money, then I can understand.)\n\n6) The first thing on the album I\'ve come to like was ""Fitter Happier"", believe it or not. Then time told me that it\'s just a naive experiment.\n\n7) The second and last thing I\'ve come to ""like"" on the album was the fact that they snuck a 2/4 bar in every verse of ""Lucky"". But that was it.\n\n8) I\'m certainly not qualified to say anything about the lyrics. My head works this way: first, I have to like the music, and then I can get to the lyrics - a good reason for me not to rate the album. If you fail at music-writing and production, perhaps you have no business making music at this time. You might as well just stick to articulating your thoughts and expressing your feelings in the form of a novel, an essay, or a poem.\n\n9) It\'s a good thing that you want to follow the path of adventurous production, but Jesus Christ, artsy rock music has been done way better before - and after, - in much more imaginative ways that betray the fact that the artists and the producer have actually applied themselves to making something that reflects a poetic lust for love, truth, peace, a good life. (I\'m looking at you, guys in Fugazi. ... I meant Slowdive. ... Well, both of them.) And no, I don\'t think all music should be done one way ... Man, taste is a tricky fucking thing.\n\nYou want more?\n\n10) There is something off-putting about the ridiculous melodrama in the combo of straight-ahead minor-key music, high dynamo, and dense mixing on ""Exit Music"", ""Climbing Up the Walls"", and ""The Tourist"". It\'s so cheap. It tries so desperately to sound dark to the point of ""biting-your-own-fist"", but ends up sounding laughably cheesy. This should have been an important lesson for everyone: you cannot fake pain and solemnity when you do not value subtlety.\n\n11) Sterility. Fakery. A chore to listen to. I feel like I\'ve really given up on this one.\n\n12) In defense of this album: Why do I NOT hate OK Computer? Several months ago I wrote a scathing piece about a 2018 album by a certain songstress who years prior used to come out with some truly awe-inspiring material. The album is really a despicable piece of dreck ""enjoyed"" by people who have questionable history of music-listening experience. (Forgive me for sounding like an asshole snob on that one.) OK Computer is not exactly like that. At least for the most part it sounds musical. For the most part. I mean, it has some semblance of organization. ... Eh.\n\nSo no, I don\'t hate the album. I just don\'t like it.\n\nWell, that\'s as short and sweet as it gets. And it\'s kind of nice to know that I am not perfect. Dislikers are gonna dislike, right? (Ok, so maybe there is some venting in here.)\n\n(P.S.: I wrote this review just because I felt like it. It\'s probably like some kind of a twisted form of release. One more insignificant review - check.)']",

Cosmiagramma,"['This review is a part of my ongoing exploration of Radiohead\'s discography, So It\'s Come To This: Cosmia on Radiohead\n\nThe album: OK Computer. Christ.\n\nIf I wrote about modern alienation and the 21st century and the human condition and Thatcherism and Blairism and corporations and dystopia like better writers than I have, that would be a cliche. If I said something like ""you\'ve read all about this album already, you don\'t need me to go over it again"", that would be a cliche. If I said something like ""it\'s OK Computer, what else do you need to know?"", that would be cliche, too. Even if I just left the title up there without giving it a write-up, it would seem a little on-the-nose. You can\'t say anything new about this album. You can\'t even say that you can\'t say anything new about this album, because a million people have already pointed that out.\n\nWait, I could say that I had a weird sex dream where I was hooking up with my high school crush in Buckingham Palace, and the ceiling was a giant poster of the OK Computer cover art. I guess that\'s something new, right? Now this won\'t feel so much like spitting into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe cover: Cold, abstract, alienated. Not my favorite Radiohead cover, but it sets the tone, and the ""Lost Child"" bit is nicely eerie.\n\nTime For Cosmia\'s Opinion: Right, I\'m not going to act like my opinion\'s unpopular. There is no opinion on OK Computer that\'s unpopular. As annoying as it is to be read nutritional facts about its Importance and Ambition, it\'s even more annoying when people act like they\'re in the French Resistance because they think ""Fitter Happier"" is lame. Insofar as any opinion I have is important, it sure isn\'t this one. So:\n\nOK Computer is an undeniably great album, but it is not even close to my favorite Radiohead album.\n\nI\'m not going to say that the riff in ""Paranoid Android"" doesn\'t kick ass. I\'m not going to say that ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" doesn\'t knock my socks off with its climax. I\'m not going to say that ""Let Down"" doesn\'t remind me, in its forward motion and quiet anxiety, of riding the London Underground. The forbidding beauty and terror of ""Climbing Up the Walls"", the gentle resignation of ""No Surprises"", the slow descent of ""The Tourist"" into a single chiming bell: all unimpeachable.\n\nAnd yet...\n\nThis will probably make me sound like a stupid asshole, but there\'s a real We Live In A Society vibe that I get off this album. The Bends had a bit of that, but for the most part it remained subtext. And while future albums leaned into the whole dystopian thing even harder, they showed rather than told, which I\'ll get into more when I get to those albums. But here, you can see the influence of the big Statement Record prog acts like Pink Floyd, try as Radiohead might to deny it, and I\'m not sure that\'s what I like in my Radiohead. (I said most bands that ""sound like Radiohead"" are influenced by The Bends; the exception is Muse, who are definitely inspired by OK Computer.)\n\nThat\'s not to say that this album isn\'t evocative! ""Climbing Up the Walls"" is an instant paranoia-boost, making even the most quotidian activity fraught with dread. ""No Surprises"" encompasses the deadening tedium and the curious comfort of daily life better than any song I can think of. And while ""Fitter Happier"" is as subtle as a not-at-all-subtle-thing, it\'s undeniably effective, with its Microsoft Sam drone and the snatches of voices and piano underneath it. It really does feel dystopian, but it doesn\'t feel natural. It feels less like the frightening, more-dystopian-than-the-alternative reality we live in and more like a self-conscious representation of it. And that\'s why this album, brilliant as it is, doesn\'t reach the full potential of what Radiohead can do. Except for...\n\nBest song: ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"". I said earlier that there are no unpopular opinions when it comes to OK Computer, but I still felt a bit uneasy about naming this the best song on the album. ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" and ""No Surprises"" were close runners-up, and both would be more representative of what this album sounds like. But ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" is the closest this album comes to my ideal version of Radiohead: inscrutable, jazzy, warm and cold at the same time. Bitches Brew was an influence on OK Computer, and you can hear it most clearly here: those electric keyboards are as sunset-streaked and welcoming as the ones you\'d hear on a song like ""Sanctuary"". It\'s dreamy, astral jazz-rock, like floating through neon-colored mists between skyscrapers, and it doesn\'t forget a great big hook: ""UPTIGHT! UPTIGHT!"" Hell yeah.\n\nAssorted great moments: The drumming on ""Airbag""; Thom\'s arcing vocal melody in the first section of ""Paranoid Android""; the transition from section one to section two in that song; any of Jonny\'s solos on that song; the climax of ""Exit Music""; the dueling Thoms building to transcendence in the climax of ""Let Down""; the piano of ""Karma Police""; the strings in ""Climbing Up the Walls"", going from rich to downright Penderecki-esque in their terror; the chiming guitar of ""No Surprises""; the bell that ends ""The Tourist"".\n\nDing!']",4.50 stars

stinkytransistor,"['OK Computer (1997) by Radiohead is the obvious stand-out. A big cultural touchstone of the boom times, it was so huge that even a local paper was called the ""Kensington Sun"" just for referring to it. The mass-appeal could be seen as integral to the success of the first Radiohead album, OK Computer.\n\nThis band\'s name is also used to refer to a number of all-American rock bands – all of which received some major rock-star treatment when they came to American shores.

ThimisGracias,"['OK Computer by Radiohead, an album held in such wide high regard by music critics, dare I say I\'m a bit nervous to review this album? I dare.\n\nRadiohead has always been a band, to me, that either you ""get"" or ""didn\'t get"". I\'ve always wanted to ""get"" Radiohead. Unfortunately for me to this point, I haven\'t been able to ""get"" it. I\'ve given this album a half-hearted listen to back in college when I was first really trying to expand my musical horizons. I didn\'t appreciate it, but I like to think my ear has grown since then (physical or otherwise) and I\'m ready to give it another go. A better set of headphones, a more focused listening style, and a vehement want to like this album are ready to go.\n\nWithout further ado, the album starts off with ""Airbag"" and I have to say, somehow I feel like I am already enjoying this album a lot more than I remember. I have this odd memory of it just being so bland and inoffensive, but I was clearly wrong right off the bat. This song has a clean sounding grunge (oxymoron, I know) ambiance to it, from Thom\'s slurred singing to the grimy guitar, but then is transformed in the last minute with some futuristic sounding DJ work. On to one of my favorite named tracks on the album ""Paranoid Android"", you are greeted with an acoustic intro that slowly builds on brooding vocals and teasing you a few times till you get the grandiose release around the halfway point with a stellar guitar solo that then fades quickly into hymn-like chanting but not before closing with an abrupt flashy guitar riff. This song sonically captures that essence of paranoia, the mood swings, the anxiousness, the the longing for what\'s to come. This track shows the artistic prowess that Yorke has made himself famous for. As an anecdote, had the 2001 film ""A.I.""\'s soundtrack not been composed by the legendary John Williams, I think this could have been a terrific slot in at some point, and not just because of the name. ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" is the first track I really love on the project, mostly because I think this reminds of the Radiohead that I do already know and enjoy, like ""High and Dry"" from their previous album, ""The Bends"". The guitar is psychedelic and futuristic and Thom\'s vocals are the cleanest and most impassioned so far on this track list. ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is again another well named track, although this time it doesn\'t seem quite so clever when you know the backstory. This is the song that plays as the credits roll in Baz Luhrmann\'s rendition of ""Romeo + Juliet"". That anecdote aside, I think you could slot this into any closing credits sequence and it would be a perfect fit for any drama. The somber guitars that very slowly crescendo in the end accompanied by Yorke\'s lyrics of ""we hope that you choke"" makes for a horrifying albeit fitting arrangement. Additionally, I think this definitely earns a place in my personal hall of fame of fantastic post-break-up songs. The sixth track on the album is another favorite of mine, ""Karma Police"". This track shows how Thom Yorke can take what looks like simple lyrics at face value and elevate it so much more just by performance and choice of backing instrumentals. The ""I lost myself"" outro paired with the psychedelic and screeching guitar parts gives the listener their own feeling of falling down that rabbit hole. ""Fitter Happier"" is less of a track and more of a social commentary of how the band feels about society as a whole. Although I appreciate the haunting message and the excellence of its delivery, I often don\'t appreciate being ""preached"" to in such an on the nose kind of way, as the subtlety here is about as much as a brick in the small of my back. Now after that mini-rant this is going to sound awkward, but ""Electioneering"" (an incredibly politically driven track, in case the name didn\'t give it away) is definitely one of my favorite tracks on the project. But this song is also exactly what I was talking about. It may be blunt in its narrative, but delivery is important, and being able to pair a message with a foot stomping rock track feels a lot less agenda-ed than an ominous robotic voice reciting the bullet points of life that society expects me to live by.\n\n""Climbing Up the Walls"" is an eerie and haunting track that only gets more unsettling as it continues on. The strings and vocals become slowly more and more distorted until about two thirds of the way through where the track reaches its blown-out climax that only incites more anxiety. This song gave me a very bizarre and creepy visual while listening to it. It was like being sat in a hard wooden chair across from a painter\'s easel, in a dimly lit basement, the only light coming from atop the stairs (in classic horror movie fashion). And I just sat there as black water color paint dripped from the top to the bottom and ran off the edges, but I couldn\'t move to stop it, as much as I wanted to. To me, this is a song that really harps on the effects of mental illness, something of which that hits close to home for a lot of people, including myself. I love this track, almost in a sadistic way, because of the sheer level of emotion that this song evokes. But as Uncle Ben famously said, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and I couldn\'t recommend you add this particular track to a daily listen playlist. Listen to this track when you need it most, when you need a catharsis for emotions you feel others wouldn\'t be able to empathize with, that\'s how powerful this track is to me.\n\nBack on track to the rest of the album. ""No Surprises"" is a very odd track sonically. It has these very plucky string parts and glockenspiel that emulates a very spring-like and happy emotion that is juxtaposed against some very harsh lyrics (the song starts with: ""A heart that\'s full up like a landfill, A job that slowly kills you, Bruises that won\'t heal""). It honestly just leaves me feeling very confused more so than anything else. The penultimate track ""Lucky"" raises an eyebrow for me. Now I don\'t know if this is intentional (especially because it feels a little out of character for Yorke), but this feels like a power-trip of a song for Thom. With a chorus of ""Pull me out of the air crash, Pull me out of the lake, Cause I\'m your superhero, We are standing on the edge"" and the second verse starting with ""The head of state, Has called for me by name, But I don\'t have time for him..."" it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But I must say, the track ends with a killer guitar riff, that almost makes me forgive the egotistical journey we just on. The album ends on ""The Tourist"" which is a sleepy sounding track through the first four minutes before transitioning into some understated guitar solos that make for a fitting conclusion to the album in just about every way.\n\nOK Computer comes in at 12 songs and 53 minutes in run time, which I would say is right about the sweet spot. But this album took me almost exactly double that time to listen to all the way through and do my simultaneous write up. That really speaks to the power that this album has behind it. That being said, this might be my most thorough review to date, and I did do some half-decent research into the project after the fact. What I am getting at is, I understand why critics praise this album to the degree that they do. Aside from impeccable production and arrangement that certainly speaks for itself (thematically and compositionally, I\'m not sure you can do much better), this is an album that, like ogres and onions, has layers. And that is what I\'m positive so many people find attractive about this album. It is deeply relatable and progressive in its message, it almost feels like if this were a movie I\'d immediately would have told you it was designed to be ""Oscar bait"". But this also, I think, further proves my point on ""getting"" Radiohead. Those that wish to peel back the aforementioned layers will find a treasure trove waiting for them. But for those that don\'t, as I once was, are left with an album that sounds good, but is very weird and unconventional, a combination that I wouldn\'t have rated nearly as high as I have it rated now. I still don\'t think that I ""get"" Radiohead, but I think I\'m close.\n\nOverall, this album is beautiful. But in a way that I didn\'t think I could ever describe an album, it is exhausting. The beauty is something that is almost earned rather than presented, which I suppose is part of the allure of the project. It is well worth the listen, but I definitely understand if it simply isn\'t for you.\n\nHigh Notes: Subterranean Homesick Alien, Karma Police, Electioneering\nHonorable Mentions: Climbing Up the Walls']",4.00 stars

arabfunny123,"['Radiohead has been one of the biggest rock bands of the past thirty years, and has been instrumental in shaping modern pop music as a whole. Their career began with a single hit, ""Creep"", a catchy little song about loneliness and isolation, and its accompanying album Pablo Honey, an alright collection of assorted alt-rock and grunge songs. However, between this album and the release of their next album, something happened. Thom Yorke fancied himself the tortured artist who wasn\'t content with fame whose profound statements on society and culture (which were on the level of high school emo poetry written in the back pages of a discarded notebook) needed to be heard by everyone. His new-found sense of self-importance and self-pity led to the Bends, a mediocre album that basically sanitized any sense of self-awareness and edginess that the alt-rock at the time had in exchange for a bland wash of nonsense. Still, there were some good songs here and there, such as ""My Iron Lung"", that resembled their original catchiness. And then came this album.\n\nWhen any band starts with something like Pablo Honey, and ends up here, they are often compared to a band like the Beatles. However, the Beatles\' songwriting capabilities were always stellar, and their later music was actually experimental and innovative for the time. OK Computer is devoid of any real experimentation and innovation, recycling old styles in and meshing them into, once again, a bland wash of nonsense without any real emotional potency. This just seems like an attempt to become something more than the sum of their parts.\n\nThom Yorke is even more annoying on this release as well. He retains this whiny and clingy vocal strain the average circle-jerking hipster would refer to as ""ethereal"" and ""isolated"", but is devoid of true intent and emotional potency, sounding like some ironic rebuttal rather than a genuine problem. I could potentially look past this if his tendency to compose a jumble of egotistical and pretentious lyrics that truly sound like an angsty teenager\'s diary wasn\'t so ear-splitting. ""Fitter Happier"" is a perfect example of this. A robotic voice lists off a bunch of problems that Thom Yorke lists with society as he yearns to return to a more earnest time. Why doesn\'t he sing this with his own voice? Is it an attempt to be clever by making a robot list off things that society requires to make it sound automated? Yes. But it sounds like a teenager saying ""No"" repeatedly and making an ironic agreement with whatever somebody is saying to them, without actually bringing up a concrete reason as to why it\'s a problem. This sort of cringy discontent with society is apparent throughout the album such as in ""Let Down"" and ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"". Other tracks are slightly more subtle in their lyricism and have a little more depth and deal with personal issues, but Thom Yorke\'s lackadaisical and rather dull voice put me to sleep. While that may be the point, that point doesn\'t make for good singing or music.\n\nSpeaking of the music, the music, as previously stated, is a bland mix of other styles in an attempt to create something new. Most of the songs are castrations of alt-rock music to make the music sound more dejected. They are all something we have heard before, but worse. There is nothing remotely innovative on this album. The songs that do veer from this formula often fall flat on their face. ""Airbag"", while one of the better cuts lyrically and instrumentally, sounds like if The Smiths and Portishead made a song together, but without the beautiful instrumental mystery and intrigue of Portishead (a lot of what Radiohead was doing aesthetically with their music was done better by Portishead). It\'s just a basic trip hop beat with reverb-washed jangly guitars. Great. ""Fitter Happier"" sounds like the beginning of an Aphex Twin outtake, with its ominous pianos and electronic sound effects, but without the musical complexity or intrigue of Aphex Twin. However, on a positive note, some of these instrumental tracks are the highpoints of the album. ""Paranoid Android"", the best song on the whole album, is musically captivating in its journey from catchy acoustic melody to complex prog/hard rock to dirge and back to hard rock. And the lyrics are actually not cringe-inducing. ""Cimbing Up The Walls"" also doesn\'t have cringe-inducing lyrics and sounds rather cryptic in its message, and the fuzzed-out guitar and violin combination throughout and the dissonance at the end are captivating. The song still suffers from Thom Yorke\'s incessant moaning.\n\nThis album, in my opinion, is a low-point in a good band\'s career. It\'s like the red-headed step-child in my opinion, but most people consider it to be the perfect all As All-American student-athlete. It lacks the catchiness of their early work, but lacks the experimental and cryptic tendencies of their later work like Kid A and Amnesiac, which are their two best albums in my opinion, or the emotional resonance of A Moon-Shaped Pool. It is overrated and doesn\'t deserve the praise it gets.', '']",1.50 stars
hothands,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""I revisited this one recently, and now I can pinpoint my own criticisms as to why OK Computer is not my pick for the greatest album in Radiohead's discography. I originally saw this one as a weird sidestep album to see if they can get away from brit-pop, but now I think of it as a transitional album. The first half, from Airbag to Karma Police, is one of the greatest runs in music from the 1990s. Even Paranoid Android, a song that I felt was disjointedly put together from various rejected RH songs into one composition, isn't as jarring as I remember it being. The highlight for me will always be Let Down, one of the most beautiful songs this group has ever made. I will always be floored by it when it comes on. While relistening to this again, the climax of that song came in right when I put my foot down on the concrete while getting off of a bus, and it felt earth-shattering to me.\n\nThe second half, from the Apple text-to-speech monologue onwards, is where this album drops a bit in quality. This is where I lose interest in listening to the rest of it. What bugs me about this side is that it isn't as daring to experiment with other genres as the first side is. How do you go from the trip hop-tinged Airbag to the above-average political ballad Lucky? All of the songs here aren't as great as the brit-pop centric ones from The Bends, either. I'd rather put that album on again than sit through the run from Electioneering to The Tourist.\n\nSo there it is; after many a discussion with friends over this album, I can finally say that OK Computer is... good. I'm honestly ready to put this one to rest. After the sessions for it were leaked, and Yorke released them officially with the profits going to Extinction Rebellion, the greatest honeytrap protest in the 21st century, the mystique of this album is dead to me. That's a write-up for another time.""]",4.00 stars

Sabalos,"['Even when I wasn\'t much of a Radiohead fan, I always thought of OK Computer as an easy four-star record. Now, deciding to officially Rate it, I went on a little journey where I toyed very seriously with the idea of a lower rating. But in the end the quality of the album is kind of inarguable.\n\nBack at the dawn of time, when I was first poking around online music forums and properly becoming a nerd, a forum friend once told me of his experience of Cynic\'s Focus (bear with me). Prior to trying to branch into metal, he was a very serious jazz/fusion/art rock fan, so Focus seemed like a natural way to try and explore the new genre. And as a jazz listener, he initially clung to the jazzier tracks on the album, ""Textures"" especially. Then, as he grew into actually liking metal and not just tolerating it around his jazz, he moved on to preferring ""How Could I"" (because who wouldn\'t) and saw ""Textures"" for what it was – a fun and adventurous attempt at jazz fusion for a metal band, but not a particularly strong fusion track in itself. ""Electioneering"" was, for me, the rock I clung to when I first came to OK Computer, because it was the closest thing the album had to a hard rock song. Nowadays.. I mean, it\'s not a bad song. But now that I actually like the rest of the album, and Radiohead as a whole, I just don\'t like it that much, or at least don\'t feel compelled to listen to it. That was the first crack in my easy-four-star mentality.\n\nAnd then, what about ""The Tourist""? Is ""The Tourist"" anyone\'s favourite song? I listened to the album just yesterday and now I\'m sitting here writing a review of it and I can\'t even remember what ""The Tourist"" sounds like, except for a feeling that it is too long. Similarly ""Lucky"" – not a bad song, but I just don\'t really care, plus lyrically and thematically it feels like it is covering ground ""Airbag"" already covered better a few songs before.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe highlights are pretty undeniable – ""Airbag"", ""Paranoid Android"", ""Let Down"", ""Exit Music (For a Film)"", ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" and ""No Surprises"" are all top tier. ""Karma Police"" and ""Climbing up the Walls"" are probably right down at the bottom of this pile, but they\'re still great. (I do genuinely like ""Fitter Happier"" too, even if it doesn\'t really count as a song.) That\'s a strong collection of some of the best music of its era, which makes a pretty strong case in the album\'s favour. And it still sounds like it fell into 1997 from some other place – not necessarily the future but, despite boiling down to \'just\' five guys with regular rock instrumentation, it doesn\'t quite sound like anything else. It\'s the attitude I guess; it doesn\'t bother with the swagger of the Brit-genre bands of the 90s, and the bands it influenced going forward just seemed to take the vocals and turn them into whining without capturing anything else. Whatever – there\'s a more articulate discussion than I\'m capable of to be had here, and I\'m sure many others have already had it. Ultimately I suppose I\'m in music for the sounds and the songs, so for me this is just a collection of a few of the best.']",4.00 stars

Djoom,"['You know for as long as I have actively listened, researched and sought out music, almost ninety-five percent of that music, good or bad, has made me feel some sort of emotion, it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me wanna throw something heavy through a window, lots of it gave me an adrenaline rush, a majority has amplified my brooding nature.\n\nThis is a huge part of what I believe is and isn\'t good music, an emotional response, of course along with a catchy hook and some interesting songwriting. the worst thing a band could possibly do is trigger little to no emotional reaction from me. even really shitty artists can get something from me, Taylor swift makes me frustrated at her antics and ego, Cardi B makes me angry and I want to throw something at her, Deicide makes me laugh because of how eyerollingly stupid the themes of fake satanism are. those are just a few examples but they all share that same trait.\n\nHowever as I said the worst thing a band could do is not give me any reason to emotionally invest myself in the music. if it leave me with nothing than it\'s an automatic failure, songwriting and catchy hooks be damned.\n\nOK Computer unfortunately has fallen into this whole, and so has the rest of Radiohead. I\'ve given this band too many chances and they wasted them all. The issue was present even before I listened to this band.\nEveryone kept saying to me ""Listen to Radiohead."" or ""Hey dude have you heard of Radiohead?"" and I\'m like ""Yes I\'ve heard of them."" I was going to listen to them but I\'m lazy and I kept forgetting, it got to a point where I didn\'t forget and I just didn\'t want to do because I kept getting the same response when ever I even uttered the name. I didn\'t wanna talk about Radiohead and so I didn\'t.\n\nUntil I joined RYM. Now here I am sitting here writing review and talking about it. Recently I have gotten a couple of comments from people complaining about the ratings I have for their first three albums (All of which are now deleted because I ain\'t having that shit.) and my train of though lead me here. to this band\'s page writing about how much of a bore this band is.\n\nAnd what a bore they are, I will stand by that statement until my ashes are thrown to the wind. Those comments made me listen to the album one last time to see if I did somehow change my mind.\n\nSpoiler alert: I didn\'t.\n\nThis album is bloated, uninteresting and leaves me with squat. Yorke is whiny as fuck and I don\'t care, the atmosphere is bland, at the very best it\'s the average man\'s 90s music. Nothing special at all, and I partially blame the fan base for hyping it up far too much, it reduces the appreciation quality by like ten percent each time.\n\nAnd people say this is Art Rock? I\'m not seeing much art here, If I didn\'t know any better I would think this is just another U2 album. It is that unmemorable.\n\nHowever at the end of the day, music is music, and it\'s all based on subjectivity, so If you like this album; if you like Radiohead, I don\'t hate you. You are not a bad person for liking this, and maybe there is something wrong with me I don\'t know. What I do know is that a lot of people like OK Computer and I\'m fine with that, I\'m just not in those numbers and if you try to convert me again I\'m gonna gather as many Copies of okay computer and burn them all.\n\nThis isn\'t a bad band I\'m just tired of them.']",1.00 stars
Kd11438,"[""Fine. I give in. This is a great album. After listening to Kid A I was not expecting something so immediately accessible and satisfying. Lots of very very special transcendent musical moments. I will say, though, that this album is not perfect in my eyes. It's like a 4.89, so closer to a 5 but I really wish the album was tighter as an experience. Even on the best songs here, there are moments that drag, instrumental and atmospheric indulgences that, although they sound great, make the album feel much longer than it is. And this may be a controversial take, but I think they should have just cut No Surprises. It's a lovely, lovely song, but it sounds sooo similar to Let Down to my ears, and as pleasant as the song is, it just doesnt stick out to me as an important moment on the album, in an album chock-full of electrifying moments.

Otherwise you should go full ambient instead of putting some guitar playing in the middle.\n\nAlthough the vocalist sounds so sleepy with his talking (I wouldn't call this singning) to make me sleep, which is a plus.

damir,"['Since everything that could be said about this album has been said on this site I’ll just give an unpolished review. Airbag really is one of the greatest openers of all time to a rock album, there’s just a special quality to it that I’ll never be able to describe. Paranoid Android has one of the most exciting climaxes ever, with a classic guitar solo. Subterranean Homesick Alien is just great with it’s weird twangy and aquatic-sounding guitars, and Exit Music is so beautifully dreary. Let Down might be Radiohead’s best song, it’s so dreamy and lush. Anyway, I don’t have a lot to say about the other songs on here, except I really agree with the sentiment of The Tourist, and it’s a fitting closer for this album. It’s not that the songs I don’t have anything to say about are bad or anything, they’re all fantastic (however Electioneering is the ONE song that’s slightly lackluster then the rest, the chorus sounds a little generic). Anyway, I can forgive any flaws to this album because the guitar tone and the production is practically perfect.

Tackle what is considered by many to be the best album of all time, because I’m obviously qualified to do so. I’m also fairly new to Radiohead, so yeah. But for real, I don’t think this is the greatest album of all time or anything, but I do really love it. Of the 4 Radiohead albums I’ve heard so far, this is my favorite. So let’s dive into it.\n\nThe first song here is Airbag, which, honestly, I think is alright. I like it, but it doesn’t grip me that much, and I think it’s overhyped amongst the fan base. The lyrics are solid though. The next song is Paranoid Android, and while I have no idea what this song is about, I don’t care. It sounds awesome. The heavy breakdown in this song is probably my favorite moment in a Radiohead song, and I love it and this song. Then we get Subterranean Homesick Alien, which sounds good, and has a good concept about wanting to be abducted by aliens because you don’t feel at home amongst humans. Then we get the ominous Exit Music (For a Film), and I absolutely love it. I love the Romeo and Juliet-based story it tells, the buildup in instrumentation, and Thom’s voice. You also don’t see many songs that end with the line “we hope that you choke.” That darkness then transitions into Let Down, which is the saddest song here, and I love it. Thom sounds great here, the guitar is beautiful, and it has lyrics about a feeling we can all relate to; disappointment. I love this one. Then we get the big single, Karma Police. I love this song because not only does it sound good, but the lyrics here are important. With the introduction of Cancel Culture to the internet, this song has more meaning than ever. No idea what it means in 1997, but the accusatory lines and the lines saying “I’ve given all I can but it’s not enough” perfectly exemplify what I feel Cancel Culture does.\n\nTo start off the second half, we get the dark interlude Fitter Happier. It doesn’t have much meaning outside of the album, but I love the dark atmosphere it creates. Then we get fun political anthem Electioneering, which is led by cowbell percussion and a catchy hook. I don’t know why, but I didn’t come back to this song like I thought I would. Then we get Climbing Up the Walls, which is considered the first of Radiohead’s “creepy” songs. And I don’t like it. It has both this creepy atmosphere and also a very slow and boring feel to it, and it just doesn’t interest me. It’s not awful, but it’s my least favorite here. Then we get my favorite off my album, No Surprises. The instrumentation here is absolutely beautiful, bordering on a lullaby. I also love the lyrics about just wanting a normal, happy life, with “no alarms and no surprises.” Absolutely love it. Then we get Lucky, which is very similar to Airbag, and I have similar thoughts. I like it well enough. Finally, this album closes with The Tourist, which is an appropriately slow song, reminding us to slow down and enjoy life, using the metaphor of a busy tourist to deliver this message. Just slow down and enjoy the scenery around you.\n\nOverall, really good album. I wouldn’t call it the best album of all time like so many others would, but I see where they’re coming from. My main problem here is just a couple songs that don’t really grip me.\n\nFavorites include No Surprises, Let Down, Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Exit Music (For a Film), The Tourist, Subterranean Homesick Alien and Electioneering.\n\nMy only least favorite here is Climbing Up the Walls.\n\nI’d give this a light 9/10.

Rather than many tracks that could come off as simple, 'OK Computer' adds layers upon layers of sound to each track, giving the entire album a spacey, futuristic atmosphere, with droning electronic noise on top of distorted guitar, paving the way for some simply excellent soundscapes and atmosphere to complement the alt rock sound that the album has, pushing it far above what would be expected of such an album.\n\nThe album keeps its sound very cohesive all throughout, a constant tone that is extremely serious and at times, depressing. The first track 'Airbag' starts the album off extremely strong, with many elements that when listened to closely, almost seem as if they're playing slightly different songs, especially the bass, which plays a riff very similar to that of 'Porcupine Tree's' 'Hatesong' while the other instruments drone on, with the aforementioned electronic noises appearing throughout, all as Thom Yorke sings in his unique way, putting emotion into the music while simultaneously almost sounding as if he doesn't really care, which ends up working out in the song's favour quite significantly. 'Paranoid Android' is an easy choice for best song on the album, or by the band in general, a 3 piece song that simply builds upon itself in each section, starting off with beautiful layered riffs over a vocal melody that set up the extremely dark tone of it, complete with some breathtaking moments, particularly the hook. The song then takes on a much heavier approach, toning down the sonic depth and instead making each individual note from each instrument, along with vocals, be filled with power, all before the third section simply blows everything else out of the water, with some of the most perfect use of vocal harmonies and layering I've ever heard, with amazing use of mellotron on top of this, leading to one of the most powerful moments on the album.\n\nAfter this point, the majority of the tracks can be put into one of two categories, the extremely atmospheric, relaxing songs, and the ones that are extremely tied to the alternative rock roots of the band. 'Subterranean Homesick Alien', 'Lucky' and 'The Tourist' all fit into this category for me, all heavily focusing on capturing particular emotions and tones, rather than making a catchy song, each sounding simply beautiful, with the last 2 closing off the album amazingly, with a gradual decrease in any sort of intensity, emotional or otherwise, until 'The Tourist' comes on, which is by far the most relaxing song on the album, and by the band in general. On the other end of the spectrum, 'Let Down', 'Karma Police', 'Electioneering' and 'No Surprises' all make for very solid alt rock tunes, with a lot of real depth to each track in terms of sound, even though the songs themselves seem very simple. 'Electioneering' is the exception to this, having a simple structure, but also being very simple and riff driven instead, with a fun, heavily distorted riff that simply allows one to rock out. 'Exit Music (For a Film)' marks easily the most impactful moment on the album, gradually building as everything distorts, starting off as a standard track before ending in something incredibly powerful and cathartic, as even Thom Yorke's usual droning vocals feel much more solemn here.\n\n'Climbing Up the Walls' takes the atmosphere a step further by not making it depressing, as much as eerie, bordering on downright terrifying, with everything having a scratchy quality to it. The song has a very distant, isolated feel to it, with very sparing use of any sort of sound, with the drum beat being incredibly monotonous and simplistic, with any other noise being infrequent, bringing even more attention to the heavy vocal distortion. The other sounds begin coming in as the song progresses, constantly making everything feel more claustrophobic, with even the beautiful string arrangements simply serving to add more contrast to the unpleasant elements of the song, all ending in a chilling scream. 'Fitter Happier' is an odd track to me, because while all it provides is creepiness, I feel like it ties the album together, despite how musically poor it is, since there is very little there other than a robotic voice and minimalistic piano.\n\nThis is definitely an incredible album, no matter what genre you insist on putting it in. It's filled with powerful emotion, immersive atmosphere, and expert use of a wide variety of techniques, subsequently leading to a collection of sonically complex compositions, each sounding beautiful and simultaneously impressive when looked at closer. 'Radiohead' significantly refined and improved their sound from their previous two efforts, adding a level of complexity and atmosphere to their alternative rock roots, making for a simply incredible album all around.\n\nBest Songs: Paranoid Android, Exit Music (For A Film), Climbing Up The Walls, Karma Police\n\nWorst Songs: None\n\nVerdict: An extremely good album with a lot of complexity to it, masked by a commercial sound, making it quite easy to listen to while also being quite interesting to analyse. Recommended to anyone who won't whine about a somewhat commercial sound."", 'Originally written on progarchives.com']",4.50 stars
Christroyer11,"['Well, I finally got around to listen to this album for the first time after buying it a year or so ago. Everybody loves this album in the music discussion/hipster sphere and I finally see why. Holy crap on a cracker, this album is excellent! I have not heard an album that was given the infamous “greatest album of all time” label and held up to that title since maybe To Pimp A Butterfly, and I love that album so much that it became my manifesto! OK Computer pulls out all the stops to influence a listener who is looking for a special album. It melds its contemporaries and influences from other acts that pushed the envelope of rock music and makes them their own to push that envelope further. This one little album caused an explosion in the music world the likes of which the world has not seen since King Crimson’s In The Court of The Crimson King. Not only that, it broke my heart and then put it back together numerous times throughout its runtime, leaving me so overjoyed that I laughed like I’ve just proposed to the love of my life and she said yes. Wow!\n\nI always start with the production, so let’s start with it again. OK Computer’s mixing, at first glance, is that standard “singer buried in the mix” thing that I don’t like about more than a few rock records. And there is an element of that, but once a song like Exit Music (For A Film) hits, I can’t stay mad at this record for long. That song and many songs like that are mixed very well. In fact, Thom’s vocals are more dynamic than vocalists on a lot of albums I’ve heard due to this very phenomenon (quite fascinatingly and a bit annoyingly). Thom Yorke opts to be another instrument as opposed to leading the charge, which is what I would usually prefer. But this is OK Computer, so this album is special. Partially because all the instruments are crystal clear. The digital and analog elements of this album are each handled with care, particularly the drums which are a part of the driving force of this album’s emotional intensity.\n\nOK Computer balances both digital and analog through its expert sound play. From the first few second of Airbag, we get a melding of acoustic and electronic in the drums. This theme is, of course, found throughout the album. We find it on Let Down with the overbearing synths and the little acoustic guitar in the left corner. Such thematic brilliance (which I will discuss later) is not possible without stellar production. The production of this record fits every peak and valley Radiohead come up with. We get a brash style of production on Electioneering to fit with the brashness of the instrumentation (I mean, the guitars and especially those drums are as in your face as Radiohead gets on that album), and more psychedelic and echoey on songs like Subterranean Homesick Alien. There are songs like Exit Music (For A Film) which are conflicted between warm and cold, which are also handled really well from a productions standpoint. This record really has it all!\n\nSpeaking of having it all, the composition of OK Computer is incredible! There is a conflict between analog and digital on this record, and both elements bring it to the fullest extent on this record. The synths on this album have a very artificial sound that plays into the themes, for example, the bridge and especially, the ending of Let Down and the crashing down in Karma Police. There are also little beeps, boops and samples throughout OK Computer that make this album feel that much more artificial. It’s hard to come up with good example because an example of this is on nearly every track. The noise way in the background of Exit Music (For A Film), the ringing in Lucky, the synthetic voices in both aforementioned tracks, and the entirety of Fitter Happier are a few of many examples of the cold, digital side of this album. But we also get the beautiful acoustic aspects of this album. The drums, I’ve already mentioned are excellent. The bass adds a nice flavour to each track. It’s sparse on Airbag and is yet, somehow more noticeable. The pianos are beautiful on Karma Police, particularly. The synths can be warm as well, such as on Subterranean Homesick Alien. The guitar fits well with every song on this album. It is clean when it needs to be and explosive on others. For a guitar led album, the guitar never lets this album be one-dimensional.\n\nThere are so many things I could gush on about with this record’s composition. First off, I’ll mention the intricacy of each track. There are often so many moving parts to these songs that all fit together so well. Particularly the synths on Subterranean Homesick Alien that never fail to make me melt. Each track is beautifully arranged. I could go on for another paragraph on the masterpiece that is Paranoid Android, with how seamlessly it transitions from one movement to the other. Let’s just say it got my Bohemian Rhapsody Award for Best Song With Multiple Parts in its respective decade for a reason. It is an amazing, diverse track. Speaking of diversity, OK Computer has it all in its composition. It has dark songs like Exit Music (For A Film), absolute bangers like Electioneering and everything in between. Whatever mood you may have, OK Computer has you covered. With this diversity comes the influence of this album. It borrows from Pink Floyd in their hey day as well as a bit of Beach Boys and The Clash. I even heard a bit of Chick Corea’s Spain (a famous jazz song for those who don’t know) in Exit Music (For A Film). While taking a leaf from other musical revolutionaries, future acts would come along and take a leaf out of Radiohead’s book. Let Down sounds like many alt-rock songs that would come after, particularly Snow Patrol’s Chasing Cars, which I loved as a kid when it came out and I still love now. As well as influencing more acts I grew up with such as Muse, The Killers and Coldplay. As such, Let Down, as well as a lot of this album, feels like a warm hug.\n\nWhat really sticks with me about this albums its lyrical content. The lyrics themselves are not wordy at all compared to other Rate Your Music/Pitchfork darlings (*cough* ITAOTS), but Radiohead is very effective with what they say on this album (enough to make me burst into tears of sheer joy). They are delivered by a Thom Yorke who throws an emotional gauntlet onto the listener. While there are times where I cannot understand what Thom’s singing, due in part to the nature of his voice and the production focussing more on vocal dynamic range. His voice, however, follows the tone that each song is going for which adds to each song’s potency. He sounds beaten down and dejected on certain songs, and he has passionate highs as well, which I absolutely adore.\n\nAs for lyrical analysis, I feel as though this album is more than what people say it is. Through both the passive and active research I conducted for this album, the general consensus was that OK Computer was about the dangers of technology and how the machines were taking over and making our lives miserable. While there is an element of that, this would be a far preachier, and therefore, far worse album if that were the only thing that it brought to the table. My personal analysis is that OK Computer is not so much warning us about evil robots and technology taking our jobs, but more worried about becoming more machine-like, mirroring the technology we created in 1997 and have been creating since. OK Computer is begging us to not be tricked into thinking that our current, fast-paced society is not only the right way to live, but the only way to live. From the eviction of a near-death experience in Airbag, to the bleakness of Fitter Happier, to the blasting of Tony Blair in Electioneering, to the closer, The Tourist literally begging us to slow down and enjoy our lives. This album is a lyrical powerhouse that taps into my emotions in more ways than one, and really, that’s all I can ask for from music. All my favourite albums do just that.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish I listened to this album a lot sooner than I did, but better late than never, I guess. Right before I listened to OK Computer, I felt an enticing aura about it. As if it was beckoning me to listen to it. Now, after all the times I’ve listened to this masterpiece, all I can really say is wow. I was wowed by how well this album was produced, teaching me about the importance of dynamics, even if it fits the dreaded rock trope of the singer not sitting atop the mix as the main melody should. The album also blends analog and digital together effortlessly, creating a sound that balances warm and cold that makes the album unique. Each track adds a different element to OK Computer and enriches it with a wide variety of sounds and emotion. Every instrument shows up and is incredibly important to these beautifully intricate tracks that are arranged so masterfully that they remind me of what Swans would do with To Be Kind years later. Speaking of years later, this one album caused an alternative rock revolution that I was lucky enough (or unlucky enough, depending on who you ask) to experience in my childhood. All this while borrowing sounds from various visionaries of Radiohead’s time, which makes OK Computer a prime example of how no great albums are an island unto themselves and the importance of experimentation in music. I’ve written all this as a part of my closing paragraph and I haven’t even gotten into the lyrics yet. Their lyrics are poignant and tell the story of human dejection in the modern age. OK Computer argues that if we are not careful, our actions will reflect the machines we create, to the point where we are indistinguishable from the robots. This album reiterates the importance of living in the moment, and affirming your life as a human being. This album is a crown jewel in rock music history and inspires me to go outside and tell the world that I am, indeed, a human being and I will live every moment of my life as well as I can. It is not the best album of all time, in my opinion, as To Pimp A Butterfly exists and has my undying adoration, but OK Computer is a benchmark in rock history, and honestly, I can see why people really love this album. Honestly, its not far off from being my favourite either and I hope you will find the time to experience it yourself.', '', 'https://www.instagram.com/christenedmusic/']",5.00 stars
Franconia,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'There\'s not much about OK Computer that hasn\'t already been said, so I don\'t feel a need to write about its legacy and significance and context and whatnot. OK Computer is one of those albums that took a really long time to appreciate. From the first time I heard it until I\'d say mid-August of 2018, I really didn\'t \'get\' it and it seemed really abstract, but some select songs stuck with me. Between mid-August 2018 to mid-January 2019, I was in a state of denial of me seriously liking a Radiohead album, and I tried picking through all of its trivial flaws to justify not giving it a perfect score and saying ""yeah definitely not their best nah not the best album of the 1990s"". I gave in. This isn\'t the best album of the 1990s, though it\'s probably the most significant.\n\nI\'ll start with the album\'s flaws, because it\'s a cracked 10 stars.\n\n1. Between the outstanding Karma Police and the haunting Climbing Up The Walls, it\'s clumsy and awkward. Fitter Happier isn\'t bad, and it has its place in the loose concept of the album, but it wouldn\'t be a big deal if it was removed. It\'s well-written in the sense that it reinforces the modern hysteria and anxiety, but some lines are just awkward, like ""a pig in a cage on antibiotics"". It ends on a dramatic note and then transitions into Electioneering, one of the band\'s least charismatic songs that\'s not bad, but extremely underwhelming. The worst elements of Muse followed this song, I guess.\n\n2. Its ending is underwhelming. Bouncing back from the aforementioned songs, you have two of the album\'s highest points, and then you have two great, but not particularly exceptional or high songs. I would be fine if this ended with Lucky, because that could serve as a fantastic closer. The line: ""Pull me oooouuuuuuuuuuut of the aircrash, pull me oooouuuuuuuuut of the lake"" would work so well if this closed a loose concept album that started with Airbag. Yes, there\'s a difference between a car crash and an airplane crash, but still. I don\'t have many flaws of Lucky, but The Tourist kinda plods along as the second longest song on the album, but isn\'t that exciting or climactic. On its own, it\'s not worth much, but it doesn\'t offer a cliffhanger or exciting ending to an exceptional album. Still, it\'s nice and atmospheric.\n\n3. Sometimes it takes itself a bit too seriously. This isn\'t a major flaw because it\'s an alternative rock album released in the 90s, and 90s alt. rock borrowed a lot of the excess of the 80s and just condensed it into other areas. I avoid, or try to avoid, using \'pretentious\' in critiques of art, but the melancholy and futuristic concepts of the album open it up for many of these critiques, even if they\'re not the most valid. Basically, it\'s not an album I\'m always in the mood for. But when I am in the mood for it, it hits like a charm.\n\nWith these flaws aside, the rest of the album is perfect. If the highs outweigh the lows, so be it. Because they absolutely outweigh the three main flaws above. I used to think the middle section was a bit dull, but I\'ve come to appreciate that stretch.\n\nAirbag is a humble opener that hints at something greater and futuristic, combining some more modern sounds to a standard alternative tune, and given what comes after, it\'s very modest and not-so-telling. This is good. On Paranoid Android, Radiohead declared themselves the greatest band of their time. It\'s an utterly ridiculous song, too. I love Bohemian Rhapsody / I\'m in Love With My Car and its bombast, playfulness, contrast, and passage-linking, like many do, and this song still blew my mind the first time I heard it. It\'s more serious and intense than Bohemian, and better too. Like the opener, this starts off humble and you wouldn\'t expect it to be that avant-garde and revolutionary. It\'s acoustic, but also spacey and atmospheric. The melody is nice and all, but it also has that sense of dread and fear to it, showing the contrast between a more upbeat sound and an anxious and looming passage. As the lyrics grow darker, it gets more tense. You get a sick guitar solo and then it abruptly switches to a moody, atmospheric, and anxious passage that\'s just sick. This is the part where it blew my mind the first time I heard it. Fuck, everything about this song is stunning and perfectly put together. The last minute and climax is also incredible, and this song is where the band declared ""yeah we\'re better than you"" and gave a F.U. to the industry and also to The Bends.\n\nThe stretch between Subterranean Homesick Alien (a definitive \'indie\' song title) and Karma Police is outstanding, consistent, and astonishing. Karma Police was probably the first Radiohead song I ever loved, and this was at the time where I strongly disliked the band outside of Creep, 15 Step and this. A fantastic piano psuedo-ballad with strong hints of downtempo and trip hop to it; amazing how it works out. Exit Music (For a Film) is jawbreaking, and whatever film it\'s for, it\'s sure as hell a dark and surreal film. It starts off with guitar chords telling of melancholy and rain and doesn\'t get any more positive from there. The Mellotron and organ and depressed chords do a lot for atmosphere, sure, but I\'ve noticed that the looped sample playing in the background-indistinguishable, but present-does a lot to make it more abstract. And the bass synth helps too-that section of the song is insane. Let Down is probably the most upbeat song here, but not exactly positive or happy. The jangly guitars over futuristic production are great, and the songwriting and arrangements are spot-on. It\'s bittersweet and melodic, and fits in really well. Subterranean.. is fantastic and a nice breath of air coming off the mammoth Paranoid Android and substantially more positive than Exit Music...\n\nClimbing Up The Walls and No Surprises aren\'t songs that I instantly liked or fell in love with; as said before, I used to find the middle stretch to be a bit weak. Fuck me, because if Climbing Up The Walls isn\'t the perfect song for when you\'ve reached rock bottom and don\'t know where to go, or if you should ever both climbing up (see what I did there?), then what is? Jesus, is that song haunting or what? While Electioneering preceded it with spooky samples sounding like the gates were just opened, and began with a riff out the door, this starts off spacey and somber, with Colin\'s downtempo bass and the looped sample. The distorted vocals are sick. I cannot tell you how much I love the production on the album. No Surprises always reminded me of Let Down in how it\'s disguised as an upbeat breath of air, but the lyrics still resonate with the rest of the album. ""I\'ll take a quiet life, a handshake of carbon monoxide"" is pretty telling of the 21st century. The entire first verse, for that matter, shouldn\'t go over peoples\' heads as easily as it does. But hey, when it starts off with that soft melody like it\'s a damn R.E.M. song, I can understand why it does. Also, it sounds like he\'s signing ""salaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad"" instead of ""sileeeeeeeeeeeeeeeence"". Never was the best vocalist in the world.\n\nYeah, I think all of that beats the three aforementioned flaws here. I guess it\'s the definitive college rock album, and it came out 22 years ago. And it\'s still as relevant as its successor, Kid A. Which one is better? I honestly don\'t know. Both mean a lot to me, but if I didn\'t revisit Kid A and come to realize how amazing it is, I don\'t know if I would\'ve checked out the rest of Radiohead\'s discography. I\'ve listened to this so many times since August though. As an album, this works incredibly well, but even on their own, most of the songs here work quite well. Paranoid Android is my personal favorite song from the band\'s wide discography just because of how mindblowing it was the first time I heard it in March 2018. It\'s still wild. It\'s also my pick for the best song of the 1990s, because no other song was quite as ambitious and eclectic as that. Karma Police is also comfortably in my top 50 songs of all time, and Exit Music... and Climbing Up The Walls are in heavy rotation. Fuck, I don\'t know why I waited so long to admit to loving this.\n\nThank you, RYM.\n\n10/10\n\nHighlights: Check track ratings or just read the review.']",5.00 stars

And even though with the benefit of hindsight I no longer really think of it as the GOAT, or maybe even as the best Radiohead album anymore, I get why it commonly gets top ranking in charts like these. This feels like the first album of The Internet Age. There is something other-worldly about this album that is so hard to pin-point, and even harder to recreate. They took the brooding pop charm of The Bends and lifted into a cloud, like alternative rock was having an out-of-body experience. Radiohead are simultaneously the mystics guiding the spiritual journey and the EMTs on the scene, doing chest compressions and injecting cortisone. They are the night shift hospital janitors, watching the body roll in on a gurney. They are subterranean homesick aliens, making home movies, for the folks back home.

soggydong,"['OK Computer- Radiohead (1997)\n\nA landmark album of the 90\'s, and one of my favorites of the decade. It was a huge leap from Radiohead\'s first album, Pablo Honey, and perfected the themes and experimentation they were toying with in their sophomore album The Bends.\n\nMany people listen to this album and see it as nothing more than a really good alternative rock album, as they fail to truly delve into what makes the album stand out. It\'s true, Radiohead did stick to somewhat typical rock musical structures (while still have the transitions and experimentation reminiscent that of Progressive Rock, however that part of their vision wouldn\'t be fully realized until Kid A), their lyrical content and eerie foreshadowing of the 21st century are what\'s key here. They somehow are able to encapsulate the feeling of post-modern society with all of our technological advancements and things like social media, when back in that day it was just slow, massive computers that could at must run ""DOOM.""\n\nAlong with the lyrics, a large portion of the youth in the 90\'s really hadn\'t listened to much music that surpassed conventional rock structures, and on OK Computer, ""Radiohead"" often step out of those boundaries; the song that everyone likes to point out, and with good reason, is ""Paranoid Android.""\n\nThe song features a fairly run of the mill acoustic session in the beginning, with Thom Yorke\'s signature vocals. After two verses and a chorus, the chorus is played a second time, however it doesn\'t break back into the acoustic playing from the beginning. Instead, the mood slightly shifts and Thom whines a melody behind the new guitar chords. When he starts to sing the lyrics, the tone is noticeably darker, an electric guitar shocks in with a power chord, and the song just goes balls to the wall with a guitar solo and some whammy bar whacking. It then calms down into another acoustic section, before ending with another explosive electric, distortion and effect filled solo with distorted scream vocals in the background.\n\nThe innovative musical content with the lyrics describing a life of loneliness and isolation that would come to be the lives of many teenagers in the 21st century, make this an album that will never be forgotten and will always be beloved.\n\nI give it a solid 9/10.\n\nFavorite tracks: Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Karma Police']",4.50 stars

Music74,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I am planning on reviewing the top ten albums on this site and first is Ok Computer. The Bends started to show Radiohead as a great band that was something special and Ok Computer did nothing but confirm it. The way Radiohead combines electronic elements with alternative rock in grandiose fashion is pretty great.\n\nTracks:\n\nAirbag: This song has Thom telling the story of how an airbag saved someone\'s life after getting into a car crash. The melodies of this song always get stuck in my head and the intro to this song is really eye catching. Ear catching? Idk. Well this song is a really great intro to the album.\n\nParanoid Android: Another incredibly catchy song on the album, I love the production. build up to when he says ""You don\'t remember, you don\'t remember, why don\'t you remember my name"". Most of the song shows Thom being bitter against someone likely spoiled and greedy saying ""ambition makes you look pretty ugly. Kicking screaming gucci little piggy."" (LOL).\n\nSubterranean Homesick Alien: I really the hazy, dreamy atmosphere of the production on this song. In this song Thom theorizes about the extraterrestrial with an almost childlike curiosity. Love how the drums kick in for the chorus.\n\nExit Music (For a Film): This may be my favorite song off the whole album. The song may not be the most bold and upfront song on the album but the emotion that Thom puts into this song makes this the saddest Radiohead song I\'ve heard so far. I love how the production crescendos in the fourth verse. The lyrics are very heartfelt and talk about wanting to escape away from troubled you are being faced with.\n\nLet Down: The lyrics on this song are some of the best on the album. To me it is talking about depression. The bug being crushed a metaphor for all of life\'s baggage weighing down negatively on your mood. The line ""bouncing back and one day, i am going to grow wings"" I feel feeds into the theme of escapism present in the album.\n\nKarma Police: Hot take but I believe that this is the worst song on the album. Its still a good song but I\'ve always found the verses a bit annoying and the production and lyrics have never seemed quite up to par with the rest of the songs. Chorus and outro are pretty catchy though.\n\nFitter Happier: Definitely a weirder song on the album which features a robot from the future talking about humans and what they should be like. The production behind this has a certain creepiness to it that is hard to shake off.\n\nElectioneering: After a series of subtle songs ending in Fitter Happier Electioneering crashes in unexpectedly. In contrast with most of the rest of the album this song is noisy and catchy as hell. Underrated and easily one of my favorites from the album. The riffs and cowbell on this album are very fun.\n\nClimbing Up The Walls: This song both succeeds in being creepy and catchy at the same time and I love how Thom sings the chorus and how distorted the production gets with the outro and Thom basically screaming ""Climbing up waaals"".\n\nNo Surprises: Unlike Climbing Up Walls this song has a very calming atmosphere that is difficult to describe. It reminds me of a mother singing a lullaby to a child and reassuring them that everything is going to be alright. The song has very sad lyrics that keep up the empty and depressive theme on the album\n\n""A heart that\'s full up like a landfill\nA job that slowly kills you\nBruises that won\'t heal\nYou look so tired, unhappy""\n\nThe production is not grandiose, but very calming and beautiful in subtle ways.\n\nLucky: This song has one of the most alien sounding and grand choruses on the album. This song lyrically has a positive and optimistic theme around ignoring the negative influences and working to better yourself.\n\nThe Tourist. This song kind of reminds me of parts of Dark Side Of The Moon for whatever reason. I really like Thom\'s vocals on this song. He has a way of conveying emotions of sadness and melancholy like not many others. I feel that the album wouldn\'t be anywhere as close to how great as it is if it was sang by anyone else.\n\nDate Released: 6/16/1997\nGenres: Alternative Rock, Art Rock,\nBest Tracks: Exit Music (For A Film), Electioneering, Climbing Up The Walls, Airbag, Paranoid Android, No Surprises, Lucky\nWorst Tracks: Karma Police\nRating: High 9/10.\n\nIncredible album and despite how much people overate Radiohead on this site this album deserves the praise it has gotten. From forward thinking themes of dystopian society to themes of depression and feeling like an outsider this album makes a statement. This album sonically sounds from another universe as it uses key changes and unique time signatures in its own way. The fusion of art rock with electronic elements was unique and influential for the albums for years to come.

It wasn\'t listening to it for the first time, but it was a close as anybody could get.\n\n삼: I\'m not sure if this album scratches that itch. I\'m not sure if any music really can anymore. Maybe I\'ve been around the block one too many times. This album is innovative, but I find myself thinking about the chord progressions, the small harmonic surprises, the influences from nearly every style of music we\'ve seen since the 1950s, the fuzzy bass tone on Exit Music, the prominent Piano on Karma Police. It\'s like I\'ve lost my music innocence. I desperately want to be able to listen to this album outside the context of knowing where it came from or the kind of music it would spawn.\n\n四: While I find myself able to identify a great portion of what\'s going on here, the album still takes me by surprise at every turn, and therein lies what I love about it. Every nook and cranny of this album has been considered and if there was something that could be added, or removed, to remove the album those things have been consequently added or removed.\n\nخمسة: Calling something ""perfect"" is a pretty hack move, but I\'m just not creative enough to be able to think of a way to make this album better. I\'m not sure if anybody is.\n\nRated as a 4.5 for the time being as I only rate albums as 5s on secondary listenings and considerations. I imagine this one will have no problem crossing that bridge though.']",4.50 stars
BillfordK,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""Yeah, there’s this little underground band I know called Radiohead, they wrote this album, it’s like, really good, it’s probably, uh, I dunno, the best album of all time…\n\n…or, you know, something to that effect. It’s a shame that it’s almost required to preface this thing with a disclaimer about how you think it’s actually not the greatest album of all time. Truly the hottest take. But when you’ve been the number one highest rated album on a popular music forum for years now, there’s not much you can do in the outset of a review than to let people know that you’re not going to completely suck off the artist and their work.\n\nThat being said, OK Computer has become such a legendary work that it’s still talked about today, it still feels fresh, and the messy scraps of recordings that were produced during its development somehow managed to crack 3.75 stars on this site. This is definitely Radiohead’s most celebrated work, with only Kid A competing, but this one is certainly seen as the more accessible of the two, and with good reason. I myself was not overly fond of this album the first time I heard it at the age of 17, and I had to listen to it three times over the course of about a year before I really enjoyed it. It’s more accessible than some of Radiohead’s other work, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not at all challenging to listen to the first go around (but hey, at the time, my music taste hadn’t really extended far beyond classic rock). So is it the greatest album of all time? …could be. I’m not going to argue that it is, as it’s not even my favorite Radiohead work, but I think that it’s certainly worth a good bit of the praise that’s heaped upon it.\n\nThe opening riff of “Airbag” is, perhaps, my favorite introduction to any album, ever. I’m not saying the entire song maintains this level of awe-inspiration, but everything before the drum track kicks in is so goddamn cool sounding that I still let out an audible and excited “oh” when it comes up on my phone. Since it’s not set against anything and is right at the beginning, the riff just comes out like it’s the heaviest thing in all of music, and I adore it. When the song picks up, the phrase “wall of sound” comes to mind in a way that I don’t associate with a lot of the other music I listen to. There’s so many different sounds happening, and yet none of it becomes overwhelming to the point that it’s just noise. Yorke’s performance on this song is nothing particularly special, but it is serviceable. Although, as an aside, I would like to say that the lyric “An angel at my door” as it was revealed on the leaked minidiscs, is far better than the “jack-knifed juggernaut” line they ended up using on the official release. This song also does a great job of setting up the album’s dichotomy of reliance on technology versus the fear of technology in ways that aren’t one hundred percent apparent on the first lesson, but are more than obvious each time you revisit it. My big issue with this song lies in the instrumental breaks, which I don’t find nearly as interesting as the writers must have. Still though, this is a great album opener, a 4/5 (147 listens).\n\nI think that “Paranoid Android” does a much better job of capturing the style and spirit of this record than the introductory song, and also has much more thrust to it as well. I mean, this song is just fantastic. The music video still does not make a lick of sense to me, but that doesn’t detract from the song itself in anyway. This is one of Yorke’s best and most memorable performances on the album, and perhaps in the entire Radiohead discography. His effortless falsetto throughout the song is spectacular, no matter which of the three distinct sections of the song he traverses. The first section of this song is a great slice of rock, any way you look at it. The lyrics can come across as somewhat nonsensical, but the huge drop on “You don’t remember, you don’t remember” is such a well-earned moment, but still can come as a bit of a jolting surprise if you’re not paying close attention. The bread and butter of this song, however, is the middle “rain down” section of the song. It maintains the percussion in a more slow rock style, while the other instruments drop out in favor of these “ah” vocalizations layered heavily on top of each other, all the while Yorke delivers a harrowing melodic performance atop the surgically-precise harmonies. This bit is one of my favorite moments on the entire album, and comes so soon as if to motivate one to keep listening. Just when the initial shock of this slow, chanting section has subsided, it jolts back to the rock feel, but with considerably more energy than it offered prior to the second section. The third section is a great outro, harkening back to Radiohead’s work on The Bends, which is always a joy to revisit in my book. This song earns high, high marks. It’s six and a half minutes long and does not feel that long at all, so it clearly earns a 5/5 (255 listens).\n\n“Subterranean Homesick Alien” has grown on me within the past two-ish months. While I initially found this song lacking in substance and viewed it as a less-talented little brother to Paranoid Android, I’ve come around to enjoying it as a bridge between that song and the next. It is a necessary step to calm the listener after the high octane ending of its last song. I’ve also come to appreciate the narrative spun in the lyrics of this song, making the words of this piece some of my favorite on the album as a whole. The concept of an alien coming to Earth and feeling nervous and isolated, looking down on the collective fear of the human race is such a great topic for a song. Yorke is an expert at writing songs about isolation and being a wallflower. This song really runs into problems with how repetitive it is, as if they had only one idea that they could derive the four minutes from. Particularly, the chorus of the song is rather bland to me. Still, this is just a small nick on an otherwise great atmospheric piece. The song still narrowly meets a 4/5 to me (110 listens).\n\nI think most people who weren’t really fond of this album on their first listen, like myself, still found immense enjoyment in “Exit Music (For A Film)”. This song contextualizes the winding-down that began with track 3, starting with this gentle solo guitar line and barely stretching beyond that for a good bit of the song. Yorke’s performance in this song is fantastic, perhaps his eeriest effort in this whole collection, save for one other track (Climbing Up The Walls). The song builds slightly in the second verse, making you think it’ll go somewhere, but when it goes back down in the third verse, it convinces you otherwise… which is what makes it so jaw-dropping when the sound explodes in the fourth verse. I remember being floored by this song, and it still gets me every now and again. Definitely a goosebumps-inspiring drop. I love how my expectations for the song to come back down at the end of this verse were denied and substituted with Yorke going up further and wailing on “We hope your words and wisdom choke you”. The magic of this song is hard to articulate in writing, but anyone who listens to it should be able to agree with why I’m giving it a 5/5 (326 listens).\n\nDirectly out of the last masterpiece comes another one in the form of “Let Down”. This one is by far my favorite on the album, and I’m glad that so many people have also come around to this state of mind in recent years. There’s a bit of an inside joke amongst Radiohead fans now that Let Down is an “underrated masterpiece”. Shout out to r/letdownappreciation. You’re doing god’s work. I digress. Let Down is undoubtedly the most pop rock endeavor on the album, and perhaps one of Radiohead’s most accessible works. I was surprised to find that they don’t often play this one live because it’s too “complicated”. When I read that, I took a closer listen to the song and began to understand. Towards the end, Philip goes absolutely nuts on the drums in a way that I feel like I will never fully be able to comprehend. Throughout the song, the drum track is one of my favorite bits – I often find myself beating along to it with my hands when I listen to the song. It’s unique for a song that sounds so much like a pop rock song. This song is also where I think that OK Computer begins to revel in the beauty of its own depressing world, which is expanded upon in the tenth track. This song is undoubtedly a bummer, an anthem about being disappointed and dissatisfied, and yet it delivers the most touching bridge in any song I’ve ever heard. Yorke’s falsetto on the repeated “You know where you are” over the chorus at the end is absolute musical ecstasy. The song is five and half minutes and feels like a standard three minute banger. I have nothing but praise for this song. It’s one of my top 3 Radiohead songs ever written, making it an obvious 5/5 song (677 listens).\n\nAnd speaking of absolute bangers, here comes “Karma Police”! I believe after Creep, this is Radiohead’s most well-known song, and I’m mostly okay with that (Let Down is better, but whatever). The groove in this song is undeniable from the very first measure. The bass line rocks, the percussion is powerful, the piano fills in the chorus are chilling. Radiohead has described two songs on this album as “funny” and this is one of them (the other being Paranoid Android). Not funny as in interesting, but funny as in “ha-ha”, leading me to believe that this band is comprised of some of the most hilariously not funny people on the planet – this song’s outro consists of Yorke repeating “For a minute there, I lost myself”. Isn’t that just hilarious? Perhaps they were being ironic and the sarcasm went over my head, but at any rate, it still amuses me a great deal. Also, another note about the lyrics being changed, originally they had “Arrest this girl, she stares at me as if she owns the world”, and changed it to “Arrest this girl, her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill”, which is a way worse line. Regardless, this song still absolutely goes off. The only knock against it, and it’s not even really the song’s fault, is that it is less inventive and less interesting than the song that comes right before it. This song is definitely on the high end of a 4/5 for me (266 listens).\n\nIt's hard to count “Fitter Happier” as a song at all. If you count it as one, it’s certainly not a good one. However, it is crucial to understanding this album, as this is the point at which the switch is flipped and the dystopic nature of the latter half is overtly established. You definitely don’t skip this song when you give the record a full listen, even though its uncomfortable atmosphere is almost suffocating. Many of my friends hate this song, as it gives them severe anxiety. I think it accomplishes exactly what it needs to – it tells the listener to prepare for a new tone. Rather than being about the depressing state of society, the second half will be about how nightmarish it will become if we let technology supersede the human element. I love the piano and background noise of this song, and I’m very glad they released it on the OKNOTOK cassette tape in 2017, it’s almost laughably grim. I will say that maybe Fitter Happier comes across as a bit over-the-top, kind of on-the-nose. There is no subtlety to it. But perhaps that’s the point. As a song on its own, it’s definitely a 1/5, but as a part of a whole, it’s at least a 3/5 (101 listens).\n\nIt took me so long to figure out that the beginning of “Electioneering” was a cage rattling, which is a nice touch to connect it to the final line of Fitter Happier, “A pig… in a cage… on antibiotics”. People have suggested that Radiohead should have replaced Electioneering with the song Lift from the OKNOTOK re-release, but I couldn’t disagree more. Not only does it eliminate the narrative through line that the song shares with Fitter Happier, Lift does not fit at all here. Electioneering tells a crucial part of the story of this album regarding a borderline hostile takeover of a government, whereas Lift is about (I think) drug addiction. Completely different ballparks, even though I would rather listen to Lift instead of Electioneering at any given time. However, this song is definitely the most straight up rock-and-roll song on the album, but in a way, that makes it… generic? I also don’t find the mixing to be great on this song, as there are harmonies going on that are barely exposed and easy to miss, even on repeated listens. This is certainly the most overtly political song this work has to offer, and the most cookie-cutter in a sense, but it is no way bad. I fully appreciate what it contributes to beginning the second half, even though this album falls into the trap that I described on my review of In Rainbows. It starts out very strong, then somewhat wanes in the second, and then ends on a high note to retroactively trick you into thinking every song was amazing. This song is not amazing – it’s just good. A solid 3/5 (109 listens).\n\nIf there were one song that was meant to describe the entirety of OK Computer, it would have to be “Climbing Up The Walls”. This piece perfectly captures a feeling of unease. The pitched-down drums, the slow build, the odd stretches of grating noises, and most of all Yorke’s performance. I would say that this song would fall flat on its face without the vocal track being performed, layered, mixed and altered in the way that it is. The effect on one of Yorke’s voice makes him sound like a demented robot singing directly into your ears, and it’s unsettling as hell. Since the song is supposed to be an aural representation of paranoia, it works like a charm. Yorke’s scream at the very end of the song is absolutely flawless in its ability to convey the panic. The only knock I have against this song is that it spends a significant portion being “good enough”. The song is about five minute long and really only grabs me when there’s a minute and a half left. Of course, this moment wouldn’t be as effective without the build up, but I guess I’m impatient, because I can’t honestly say that I thoroughly enjoy this song. However, it is a great song for instilling dread in the listener and a great descriptor of OK Computer as a whole. Despite my personal issues with it, it still gets a 4/5 (116 listens).\n\nI love “No Surprises”. Love it, love it, love it. Perhaps it’s because it reminds me more of the first half of this album than the second half. It seems much more akin to Let Down than it does to Climbing Up The Walls. I adore how this song, once again, relishes in the curious beauty of the depressing dystopia this album so vividly paints. The song feels light and floaty, but the lyrics are grim and unrelenting. The words are littered with numerous references to suicide, a hyper-appreciation of what we would consider mundane, and vague platitudes delivered with an absolutely hollow attitude, courtesy of Thom Yorke. “Such a pretty house and such a pretty garden” awakens something in me for reasons I can’t explain at all. I also highly recommend the version from the leaked minidiscs with an alternate performance pitched a half step down. I may almost prefer this version to the official released version, but I acknowledge that even this half step difference somewhat destroys the delicately crafted beauty that the initial release form exudes. Just a fantastic piece all around. It’s a 5/5 (597 listens).\n\nIf you don’t count Fitter Happier as a song (which I don’t), then “Lucky” is my least favorite part of this album. It’s incredibly low energy, and although this may be intentional, it doesn’t work for me here. Save for “It’s gonna be a glorious day”, Yorke fails to arouse any significant emotions from me during this song, and it feels longer than it is. Perhaps I’m just an idiot, but I also fail to see how this song fits into the overall arc of OK Computer. This song’s structure and build-up is, at best, a poor man’s Climbing Up The Walls. It doesn’t ruin the album, not by a damn sight, but it doesn’t really add anything either. If you were gonna replace any song here, I would definitely say this should be the primary candidate. Man of War would fit excellently, and since Lucky doesn’t seem to have any bearing on the album as whole, Lift would substitute in here fine, since it, too, does not relate to the rest of the songs. Maybe it’s too harsh, but Lucky is a 2/5 at best for me (103 listens).\n\nI’ve seen a lot of disdain for “The Tourist” as a closing track for this album, and I have never understood why. I think it’s fantastic. A slow, gloomy rock is a great note for Radiohead to end on. This song makes me visualize myself driving down a long, empty road at sunset. This is another great performance from Yorke, in my opinion, as it really motivates me to wail out the chorus with him (also, love the rhythmic breakdown of the word ‘idiot’). Each guitar solo has a huge weight that grounds the otherwise ethereal feeling of the piece. I also feel like this is a satisfying conclusion to the overall narrative of the record, as it evokes imagery of a passerby in the ruins of a toppled, collapsed society. As listeners, we don’t know what specifically led to this, we get fleeting images of it in Lucky, but there will never be an answer. I think it’s a great thematic choice, rather than stating that a certain chain of events in a technology-led society will lead to its downfall, Radiohead postulates that it doesn’t matter, that we will always end up where The Tourist describes. The length is a bit bothersome, and it’s certainly not the best that this album has to offer, but it’s still a solid to high 4/5, no holds barred (376 listens).\n\nThis album is great. There is a reason it’s the highest rated on RYM, there’s a reason it’s often hailed as the greatest album of all time. It has a very consistent narrative without it being musical theatre, the songs are memorable, the instrumentation is unique, and it was a great commentary on the world of 1997 at the turn of the millennium. Many people will never like this album, many people fall in love immediately, it was something of a slow burn for me, personally. But I don’t think my admiration for what Radiohead created with this record will ever fade. If this was the time in music history that rock music started to die, then this was a great sendoff. All in all, OK Computer is a 4.5/5. The first half is significantly stronger than the second half, but the second half never gets irritating or unpleasant to listen to.""]",4.50 stars
BVTheEpic,"['Ah, here we are. One of the most acclaimed rock albums of all time, OK Computer marks Radiohead’s official transformation into an experimental force that would impact music forever. It is generally considered to be the most popular Radiohead album amongst fans and critics.\n\nNeither its popularity nor its acclaim are unwarranted. This album deserves every bit of praise it gets.\n\nOK Computer hits the ground running with ""Airbag."" Right from the first note, you can tell this is not the same Radiohead from Pablo Honey or The Bends. Gone are the days of grunge and acoustic guitar. Here, Thom Yorke sings about being ""born again"" after a car accident. We can only surmise that this track is not only about Yorke’s rebirth, but also the rebirth of Radiohead. As I’ve said earlier, OK Computer is a whole ‘nother beast from the band’s last two albums.\n\n""Paranoid Android"" is… an experience. The track was written after Thom Yorke had an ""unpleasant experience"" in a bar, and the lyrics unambiguously reflect his absolute disdain for society. He is a miserable, depressed individual, and he makes this clear:\n\n""When I am king / You will be first against the wall / With your opinion / Which is of no consequence at all""\n\n""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" is another track from the perspective of someone who feels alienated from society. Here, rather than merely railing against society like in ""Paranoid Android,"" Yorke wishes an alien species would abduct him and take him anywhere else. He voices his complaints against a heavily electronic instrumental, one of many such instrumentals throughout the album. OK Computer’s entire atmosphere is defined by its melancholy electronic elements, as the world it seeks to create is one of coldness and depression.\n\nI don’t care much for ""Exit Music (For A Film)""- although it is an enjoyable track- but ""Let Down"" may be my personal favorite Radiohead song. Read this verse:\n\n""Transport, motorways and tramlines / Starting and then stopping / Taking off and landing / The emptiest of feelings / Disappointed people clinging on to bottles / And when it comes it\'s so, so disappointing""\n\nIn just six bars, Thom Yorke manages to perfectly describe the cold, robotic world depicted on the cover of the album. And over the course of the song’s five minutes, he gives the performance of his life. I would make the argument that the refrain leading into the final chorus is peak Radiohead; nowhere else on any of the previous or subsequent albums will you hear Thom Yorke pour such emotion into his words. His already impressive singing is backed up by the seamless transition from refrain to chorus.\n\nThe first few tracks of OK Computer are among Radiohead’s best… but the remainder of the album, while great, never quite reaches those heights again.\n\n""Karma Police"" is another track where Thom Yorke complains about society, this time calling out specific individuals (e.g. a man who ""talks in maths"" and a girl with a ""Hitler hairdo"") and saying that ""this is what you get."" At the end of the song, Yorke reminds himself that he, too, could fall victim to karma and should probably stop calling for the universe to punish other people. ""Fitter Happier"" fits the robotic, borderline-dystopian world that OK Computer seeks to establish, especially due to its haunting instrumental, but it feels unnecessary, considering that Radiohead has never been a band to stuff their albums with filler. ""Electioneering"" is one of the album’s more political cuts, and has some impressive chords throughout. ""Climbing Up The Walls"" is arguably the strongest track on the second half of the LP; strings and drums (as well as the screams at the end) effectively create a dark atmosphere as Yorke sings about mental illness:\n\n""And either way you turn / I\'ll be there / Open up your skull / I\'ll be there / Climbing up the walls""\n\nAlbum closer ""The Tourist"" is significant to me mainly because of the final verse:\n\n""Hey man, slow down, slow down / Idiot, slow down, slow down / Hey man, slow down, slow down / Idiot, slow down, slow down""\n\nImagine this verse is from the perspective of someone about to get into a car accident. Then remember what the opening track of the album is about. Everything comes full circle.\n\nOK Computer should be required listening for not just rock fans, but for music lovers in general. It’s not a perfect album- very few are- but it’s still an excellent piece of art.', '', 'https://bv-reviews.webs.co\nm/apps/blog/show/46357911-discography-r\nanked-radiohead', 'https://bv-reviews.webs.co', 'm/apps/blog/show/46357911-discography-r']",4.00 stars
JoyDivisionOvenGloves,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""I had heard this album long before I discovered this website and I was genuinely baffled to see this is the number one album. I assumed it was a popular enough album hence why I tried it out to begin with but not this popular. My initial impression with this album is that apart from kinda liking first two tracks the rest of it bored me. Nowadays I don't quite dislike it as I used to but it hasn't grown on me say the way Joy Division has, Joy Division I wasn't massive on when I first heard them and I have grown to love them but Radiohead on the other hand I largely still don't get much enjoyment out of their discography. I do like this more now but I still don't get why its such a highly regarded album when I find it to be a kinda mixed bag overall. I still really enjoy the first two tracks but it the rest of it varies for me. Subterranean is decent, the kinda mysterious eerie sound is pretty good I guess. Exit Music on the other hand is a dreadfully dull song, too long and meandering. Let Down is a decent ballady song with a catchy hook, also I can say I like No Surprises, Karma Police and Electioneering. Electioneering is a welcome throwback to the good Bends album. Theres also an annoying 2 minute robot interlude because reasons. The rest of it is not bad but just does little for me. At the end of the day this is an OK album which is kinda interesting in what it does with the alternative rock thing and a few good songs but nothing exceptional except perhaps Airbag which is an amazing eerie opener and I wish the rest of the album when for that kinda sound. I have never been massive on Thom Yorke's vocals and its the next album where I find it to be even more grating but here I can overlook it in places because there is fair amount of good riffs and interesting sounds though not enough for me overall.""]",3.00 stars
lundy_fastnet_irishsea,"[""OK Computer is almost always referred to as a perfect record. Disproving this proves to be an arduous task when you take a look at the track listing. Songs like Paranoid Android, Karma Police, No Surprises and Lucky would be enough to make this album more lovable and memorable than it's contemporaries, but then we also get songs like Airbag, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music (For a Film), Let Down and Climbing Up the Walls that are like reinforcements to the more famous songs. It's easy to see why this record is one of the most beloved albums of all time.\n\nThe song immediately starts with a rock-themed song, giving us familiarity and comfort. After which, we are launched in the jerky, glitchy Paranoid Android. This 3 sectored song sends you on a sonic roller coaster, one section containing tension, one where the tension is released followed by a sombre reflection on the tension, then returning to the anger of the second section. The guitar work is absolutely immaculate, seeing Jonny perform this live is invigorating, the energy with which he performs is mesmerising.\n\nWe are then slowly let down by Subterranean Homesick Alien. This is a sonically dreamy song. The lyrics of this song describe a man's desire to leave behind the world and humanity as he seeks alien life. He sees the world from an outside perspective, and through this discovers that people are 'uptight'. He dreams about being abducted and wants to become friends with the aliens. This song is all about loneliness and isolation and seeking an alternative.\n\nWhen they first started to record OK Computer, Radiohead were asked to write a song for 'Romeo and Juliet'. As a result, they produced Exit Music (For a Film). This is a beautiful song. It opens with just Thom and an acoustic. Then strings are added, which brings a whole new feeling. It adds tension, especially with the chords used. After we hear what sounds like children in a playground screaming. One reviewer, Vinyl Rewind, described this sound as 'a memory', which is superbly accurate in my opinion.\n\nThe last A Major then fades into Let Down. A powerful song that addresses Thom's life travelling for what felt like an endless amount of time. Everything in the first verse addresses travel and the isolation that Thom felt from this. This is the main theme of the song. During The Bends tour, they spent most of the time travelling, which left Thom feeling dissociated and dejected in an everchanging world. Let Down is Thom's answer to this, and in the tour for OK Computer Thom's isolation and burn out got worse and worse.\n\nThe last A Major transitions nicely into Karma Police. This is one of Radiohead's most championed and famous songs, and there is little to be said about the song now. Everyone knows that this song is immensely fantastic in its execution. The lack of a definitive chorus helps this song flow effortlessly. Rightly so, this has become a staple in Radiohead live setlists, usually being the last song they play as a homage to the fans. This is followed by the experimental Fitter Happier. This is a short monologue that lays out the flaws of modern society in a text-to-speech voice. This acts as an interval song, whilst still allowing Radiohead to delve deeper into their desire to express their political opinions.\n\nSuddenly, we are kicked back into the record with Electioneering. This is OK Computer's political song. Thom criticises the government overtop distorted guitars. The song is finished with a solo reminiscent of The Bends. We are then sent straight back down with Climbing Up the Walls. A song centred around Thom's experiences whilst working in a mental hospital which definitely contextualises the song. This is easily the most harrowing and dark song on the album. The scream at the end is perfection.\n\nNext, we turn to No Surprises, another song that Radiohead fans have fallen in love with. This song is like a melancholic lullaby. A suicide note wrapped in a nursery rhyme. The lyrics are a person wishing to die slowly and ignorant to their death by carbon monoxide poisoning. The line 'I'll take a quiet life, a handshake of carbon monoxide.' clearly show this, and it definitely makes the chorus more saddening. As if the person who wrote this has disabled their smoke alarm in an effort to die bereft of the knowledge of their death.\n\nLucky was the first song written for the album. It was written for the 'Help!' album by Brian Eno. The music transition from the verse to the chorus is so uplifting, going from A minor to A major. This makes the song so much more enticing. The fact that the last chord doesn't resolve is a perfect setup for the last song, 'The Tourist'. This is an underlooked song in my opinion. It was barely played live. However, it's one of the most emotional songs on the album. It was inspired by a man that Thom saw in France, rushing around trying to see every landmark possible. It highlights our desire to discover new things and the proposed importance of creating memories or the ability to say 'I've seen this' and yet never living in the moment which is the exact point of the holiday - to get away from it all. To these people, Thom says 'Hey man, slow down'\n\nIn conclusion, OK Computer is an album about the isolation Thom felt at the time as well as how society was being impacted by the advancement of technology. However, the most important theme is loneliness.\n\nThis is an album that is both sonically and lyrically rich and near-perfect. It is an essential listen."", '']",5.00 stars

LimedIBagels,"['Jesus Christ, SHUT THE FUCK UP. No album has given us as much childish hipster-geek bickering as this one, and for a while there this album was used so often as some sort of status symbol or punchline that it\'s now practically impossible to say anything about it that might be observant or useful. Me, I don\'t have much connection to this album any more, not on a personal level — it\'s too clinical, too humorless, too knowingly cathartic for me. (I\'d rather listen to Kid A or even The Bends any day, though I acknowledge that OK Computer is the better album.) But to deny the artistry and talent involved, or to deny what it \'meant\' (whether you wanna admit it or not, it may well be the last Full Length Album before My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy that actually felt like it truly signified something as a whole, culturally) would be idiotic. Just because you\'ve tired of something for personal reasons doesn\'t mean that its (OBJECTIVE) aesthetic value has withered. Is it really so crazy that I can listen to the counter-melodies in ""Paranoid Android"" and acknowledge the song as an extremely accomplished piece of work, a goddamn suite for globalized Gen-X corptocracy anxieties, while at the same time acknowledging that I\'d never choose to listen to it again? Is it so crazy to appreciate ""Karma Police"" as a fantastic blend of ""Sexy Sadie"" and ""Where Is My Mind?"" while admitting that - like the album - it\'s just too goddamn clinical for me to hear without feeling slightly nauseated? Apparently so. Christ, is OK Computer the new Mason-Dixon Line?\n\nDespite impenetrabilities and insecurities that can get pretty annoying if you dwell on them (and frankly could never be as awe-inspiring as the more \'universalist\' statements of earlier eras in popular music), OK Computer is, ironically - of course, \'ironically\'; it was the \'90s, so without an obviously cynical bent the generation might\'ve gotten fussy before nap-time - is actually, despite its concepts of an emotionless paranoid plane, pretty outdoorsy music. The summer airs of ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" (easily my favorite song on the album and the only one that I\'d leave on if I shuffled to it; fond memories of July evenings hanging out on my parents\' roof), choruses soaring forward with blips and crunched guitars and warm keyboards all zipping \'round like hovercars (it reminds me of Bowie/Eno\'s ""A New Career in a New Town"" in that way); the cello in \'Airbag"" (sly Lamb Lies Down on Broadway of an opener, which nobody ever mentions) disguising the seeping guitar that comes in on \'In a deep, deep sleep...\'; the way ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" sounds chilly enough to evoke dry stagnant winter and is made even creepier by samples of a cheery beach (things are always scarier and more disturbing when they\'re placed against a normalized background; that\'s what makes the long-overdue scream at the end of ""Climbing Up the Walls"" hit harder than a usual scream, considering all the songs that preceded it); the clear-skied anesthetic limbo of ""No Surprises""; the childlike harmonic slides in the last third of ""Karma Police""; that expanding synth in ""Climbing Up the Walls"" that sounds like bubbling digital lava, undiminished by the addition of dramatic strings; the rocking, spirited guitars of ""Electioneering"" that are such an excellent kickstart into the album\'s final third as it follows the kind of interlude that\'s just right for a record like this (clearly an interlude, but one that doesn\'t cut the atmosphere short and in fact draws you deeper in to the sequencing). And that twinkling guitar part in ""Let Down"" - you know the one - just basks in its own airborne bliss — for as long as it can, anyway: naïve enough to think these feelings could be eternal, but smart enough to be able to briefly set aside the angst in favor of a new sensation. Sounds like people falling in love, is what it sounds like.\n\nThe dirty little secret of Radiohead is that none of these guys can play their instruments all that well. For all Jonny Greenwood\'s needs to prove himself as some sort of classically-informed auteur (matching him perfectly with Paul Thomas Anderson, cinematographer with an empty head), his work on \'Paranoid Android\' is about as close as he\'s ever come to proving himself as a virtuoso on his own instrument, and even there it\'s mostly from his interplay with Ed O\'Brien (who\'s probably a little underrated as an effects guy). Plus a lot of Phil Selway\'s drum parts sound kinda samey, don\'t they?\n\nAnd as for Thom Yorke...look: he\'s a genius singer. Radiohead\'s achievement in updating progressive/art-rock for the alternative rock/electronic music era is analogous to R.E.M., another band with a genius singer and a band but who instead updated the Byrds for the post-punk era. (Side note: both R.E.M. and Radiohead have a similar limitation, which is that almost all their good songs are deadly serious.) Yorke\'s singing style is consistent in all of his performances: like a disgruntled mutant, stunted in growth, with his every physical and psychological feature horribly gnarled and twisted; seething with resentment, too weak to do anything but consumed with a desire to tear you apart. It\'s a powerful, unique style, and deserves tremendous respect. But it\'s also unhealthy. The world isn\'t as bad as that, and singing as though it were is defeatist.\n\nI remember when my parents first got a color-image, internet-equipped computer, back in the late \'90s. Some long-gone Compaq. I was so awed when my dad brought it home and first started it up - complete with Eno\'s entrance music - and witnessing its damn-near otherworldly processing of information; there could\'ve been entire universes of electric color encased in that box, for all I knew. I was excited, and yet I didn\'t really care for more than a minute or two — I just wanted to play around with it. To my pampered Gen-Y mind, the computer was just another tool, albeit a tool that I couldn\'t understand and would probably never understand. Here in 2018, I still have no idea how the fuck these things work, or how they were ever made to.\n\nIt\'s embarrassing that such a simple point has been lost, in among all the bickering, but OK Computer is still the closest a rock band has come to capturing the manner and feeling of a personal computer. Just listen to the first 20 seconds of the album and those clean, cold cuts of the drums: the terrifying possibilities of where this stuff could take us, and the glorious realization that we\'d even been able to come this far in the first place. For all the lyrics from OK Computer that\'ve wormed their ways into the \'alternative\' lexicon - \'Kicking squealing Gucci little piggy\'; \'Let down and hanging around\'; \'For a minute there, I lost myself\'; \'Slow down, idiot\' - for me the most beautiful one barely gets mentioned even though it sums-up everything this album stood for and everything the digital boom still stands for in this decadent young century: \'Scrolling up and down/I am born again.\'\n\nBut y\'know, it\'s all in the title: Okay, computer. I\'m okay, computer. Are you okay, computer? Okay, computer — whatever you say.\n\nA.']",
bentoou,"[""To be perfectly clear, Radiohead is the single most overrated band I've heard in my life in my opinion. If there wasn't so much hype around it, I feel like I might've been able to just ignore them. Dull lyrics that explore dull and played out topics, drowned out and barely understandable vocals, instrumentals that are really only lightly experimental and a little bit above average in terms of how pleasant they are, these things hold back the band a lot on all their albums. While not all are present in full force here, it's still enough to make it barely good. Overall, the album is very mediocre, goes nowhere and fast, and is hardy the patron saint of music everyone says it is.

Boddah04,"['Hablar de Ok Computer es hacer referencia a una de las obras más magistrales de la industria, una de esas obras especificas en las que el concepto de cada canción y el álbum, la producción, la letra, la voz y los arreglos de los instrumentos encajan de tal forma que se obtiene un producto bastante redondo y con bastantes matices que se pueden desglosar y analizar por separado de forma muy minuciosa. Lo que hace interesante a este álbum en un principio es el concepto, la forma de abordar la melancolía y ansiedad desde un punto de vista futurista le otorga bastante personalidad al álbum mediante letras elaboradas y conceptuales, letras que, sin resultar ser complejas juegan mucho con analogías y no resultan ser directas del todo, del concepto del disco y la letra de sus canciones deriva la producción y los arreglos del álbum, ambos aspectos resultan ser sumamente ambiciosos por el sonido tan pulido que se consigue a lo largo de las canciones, a los elaborados arreglos de guitarra eléctrica en ocasiones se les añade instrumentos como la pandereta, piano, guitarra acústica o inclusive hasta un cencerro.\n\nAl analizar el sonido que Radiohead alcanzo con este disco y los instrumentos empleados es imposible no detenerse a considerar cada canción por separado y lo que aporta a la idea general del disco, Airbag abre con una serie de guitarras eléctricas que van variando a lo largo de la canción y van captando diferentes momentos a través de esta mediante un sonido variado que en ocasiones se siente hasta saturado, todo esto haciendo una canción bastante solida que culmina con arreglos digitales distorsionados que denotan cierta intensidad y experimentación, una canción bastante llamativa de principio a fin, Paranoid android es sin ninguna duda la joya más grande del disco, una canción que solo puede definirse como una obra maestra debido a su tremenda complejidad y soberbia, con una estructura que varía y que va cambiando a través de esta sin que haya altibajos y con una instrumentación compuesta por varios niveles, a la que inclusive se le incorporan armonías vocales para dividir al último tramo de la canción del resto de esta. Subterranean Homesick Alien de igual forma resulta interesante, en ella la banda juega con las notas del teclado y diversas guitarras acústicas haciendo algo impredecible los arreglos de la canción a lo largo de esta, todo ello sin descuidar la producción al poseer arreglos de fondo, Exit Music (For a film) empieza ofreciendo algo diferente, una canción más calmada y simple que empieza con una guitarra acústica y progresa constantemente incorporando múltiples armonías vocales y sonidos experimentales, Let down al igual que las canciones previas del disco juega mucho con el rasgueo de la guitarra pero lo reafirma mediante un puente bastante interesante al que se le incorporan sonidos digitales, de igual forma esta canción tiene la que es posiblemente la mejor interpretación vocal de Thom Yorke en el álbum al bruscamente cambiar de notas bajas a notas más altas después del puente, cambiando del sonido melancólico y desolador a un sonido más optimista.\n\nLas primeras 5 canciones del disco se ven consolidadas con Karma Police, una de las canciones más reconocidas de la banda y que consigue seguir ofreciendo personalidad mediante una canción que se va desarrollando con acordes de piano y que tiene que cerrar de forma experimental para no desentonar con el concepto del álbum, lo que nos lleva a la siguiente canción , Fitter Happier es una pieza la cual debe ser la más conceptual de todo el álbum, con arreglos de piano, voces habladas y sonidos aleatorios distorsionados su finalidad es transmitir los esquemas sociales ya establecidos y que pueden llegar a ser una fuerte presión sobre nosotros, el álbum continua con Electioneering, una canción cuyo concepto se basa esencialmente en ofrecer un tipo de rock enérgico y cargado con muchas guitarras, lo cual a estas alturas del álbum consigue traes frescura y ofrecer un punto de vista diferente en el disco por su sonido tan especifico. Climbing up the walls mediante arreglos de cuerda, su efectiva y protagonista batería aunado a excéntricos arreglos a lo largo de esta constituye lo que es la canción más experimental del disco, No Surprises es una de las canciones más solidas de este, un sonido muy bien logrado por su producción que consigue consolidar y ejecutar sublimemente ideas que ya se venían viendo en otras canciones como vienen siendo Let Down o Karma Police, hasta este punto del álbum se puede observar una enorme cantidad de ideas desarrolladas específicamente en cada una de las canciones, otorgando un toque de diversidad sin perder la dirección que ya se tenía acabo y complementándose cada una entre estas, resulta increíble como la banda consiguió manejar diversos conceptos llevándolos a los mejores términos posibles en cuanto a calidad sin sacrificar la cohesión en ningún momento.\n\nUna vez pasadas las primeras 10 canciones viene la primera canción que puede parecer que desentona, Lucky es una canción bastante solida y de calidad por sus arreglos de guitarra pero que llega a desentonar por lo directa que es, la interesante producción sigue presente debido a que a las guitarras se le incorporan el tipo de armonías vocales sofisticadas que ya se habían visto en canciones como Exit Music(For a Film), además de un sonido de fondo distorsionado que consigue añadirle algo de personalidad a la canción en general, una canción que es bastante solida pero se pierde un poco el hilo que se venía presentando en las canciones pasadas al tener un estilo más propio del rock alternativo que se vio mucho en los 90’s, el álbum finaliza con The Tourist, una canción que de hecho recoge las ideas de la canción anterior, ofreciendo guitarras eléctricas con un tempo más lento y ejecutado de muy buena forma, incorporando de igual forma las armonías vocales vistas en Lucky y ofreciendo un solo de guitarra que se repite al culminar la canción, una pieza que se parece a Lucky en concepto pero consigue separarse por la aproximación de esta, la cual se ve reflejada claramente en el progreso lento y calmado de la canción.\n\nLa lista de canciones de OK Computer representa un viaje bastante completo en el cual se analizan distintos matices y se elaboran de forma profunda sin descuidar la calidad de cada elemento de estas, mediante un orden bastante efectivo estas te llevan de la mano explorando las ideas de Thom Yorke sobre la alienación y el futuro; múltiples guitarras, voces, teclados, experimentación, arreglos de cuerda y demás entran a la formula del disco para ofrecer aproximaciones sorpresivas de una visión bastante compleja pero a la vez clara y concisa, desarrollada por la banda hasta lo más profundo del concepto en general y reinventándose constantemente a través del álbum, empiezan trepidantemente con canciones sofisticadas y cargadas de elementos, prosiguen con la misma idea ofreciendo algo diferente dependiendo de la melodía o los instrumentos empleados, todo esto para finalizar y aterrizar toda su visión diluyéndola un poco y plasmándola en un rock alternativo sin tantas pretensiones pero igualmente solido que ofrece una aproximación más directa pero que demuestra lo efectivos que son con las guitarras sin dejar de aderezar ambas canciones con arreglos experimentales. Ok Computer representa uno de los triunfos más grandes en la historia de la música, uno de esos discos que encapsulan todo un concepto y ejecutan casi a la perfección una serie de ideas tan vasta que resulta difícil de creer la forma en que se plasman estas; una visión ambiciosa, una ejecución soberbia de cada uno de los integrantes y una producción tan buena y compleja son los principales elementos de un álbum que sin duda se encuentra entre los más grandes de la historia.']",5.00 stars

This is without a doubt the start of the 2000s alternative music burst. With a track list that\'s nearly a greatest hits album, OK Computer is an iconic record that not many albums to this day compare.\n\nThe record starts with the fantastic guitar riff and jingle bells of ""Airbag."" A song that deals with Thom reflecting on his near death in a car accident that was (thankfully) stopped by the car\'s *Airbag*. The music on this is some of the most well composed with a very futuristic sound and overlapping guitar layers. The solo from Johnny Greenwood in the second half is melodic, layered, and has a creepy yet powerful feel to it. All of that is great, but the ENDING to this song is unbelievable. It starts to break down and decompose a bit with the glitch call and response from the guitars and bass which is then followed up by Thom Yorke\'s dry descending melody that gets echoed and layered by a great string synth. The real genius of this ending is the call back to the opening riff and how it interplays and dances with Thom\'s melody. A truly remarkable opener.\n\nThat is followed up with the highly praised almost Prog like ""Paranoid Android."" This song rocks the house and has 3 different but equally kick ass parts and a reprise at the end (my favorite part). There\'s not much to say about this song and although it\'s not really one of my most favorites off of this album I can almost get the huge appeal and why this is still one of the bands most famous songs next to ""Creep.""\n\nThe rest of the track list has great contrasts with the beautiful relaxed ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" into the epic and chilling ""Exist Music (For A Film)"" (Used brilliantly in the episode ""Shut Up and Dance"" from the Netflix original program ""Black Mirror"").\n\nAfter that we get the melodic and dissociative ""Let Down."" One of the more poppy songs on the record, but don\'t let that distract you from the poetic lyrics and amazing climax of this track.\n\nThen we get ""Karma Police."" A piece I feel deserves all the acclaim it receives and is the bands objective best song. With some of their best lyrics, we get a perfectly accessible yet powerful, moving, innovative, and catchy as fuck track that has one of the best outro/refrains I\'ve heard in popular music.\n\nThe second half of this album I feel isn\'t as iconic but takes a more cohesive and story like approach to the topics of the record, starting off with ""Fitter Happier."" An interlude that tends to get misunderstood, this piece sets the mood perfectly and is criminally underrated.\n\nThe closer to this album ""The Tourist"" is nice and slow, with an explosive chorus that makes sure this masterpiece ends on the best note it can. It ends the record off with a little ""ding"" which almost leaves this depressive concept with a bit of optimism and has a number of different meanings.\n\nThe one issue with this record is the song ""Electioneering."" This is a great song and is fun to an extent, but lyrically and sonically it just barely fits on this album. With the release of ""OKNOTOK"" where we got some B sides and other songs recorded in the ""OK Computer"" sessions, a lot of those songs could have fit way better on the album instead of ""Electioneering.""\n\nLike seriously if this album had something like ""Lift"" instead of ""Electioneering"" it would be perfect.\n\n\n\nFavorite Songs: Airbag, Exit Music (For A Film), Karma Police, Fitter Happier, Climbing Up The Walls, No Surprises\n\nLeast Favorite Song: Electioneering\n\n9.8/10']",4.50 stars

At the end of the day this album really isn\'t as glorious as it sounds it features songs about someone surviving a car crash, someone who is sick of his home town, the recipe to be ""happy"" in the modern world and seemingly mundane shit. But the juxtaposition of these gloriously distorted, vibrant and hypnotic guitars, keys and percussion instruments is entirely why this album gets so much cred. On top of that listen to this album right when get up, watch the sunrise and tell me this album isn\'t a masterpiece. A perfect album by most individuals standards. The only reason why ""music critics"" knock it is because it is overrated. But music can\'t be overrated because it\'s subjective. How can you personally overrate something, you base how you like an album on how it effects you. Not on how good the compositions are or the musicality that\'s just looking past art as a medium entirely. It defeats the purpose of creating music and listening to it. So grow a pair, listen to this album all day long and gain some appreciation for the album that Thom Yorke dreads to tour. The album plays on the mundanity of Western life in the modern day, he predicts it depicts a dramatization of the issues the 21st-century would ultimately be placed with; global warming (I\'ll take handshake of carbon monoxide), isolation, wanting more meaning in the pursuit of existing (I tell I\'ll my friends but they\'ll never believe me they think that I\'ve finally lost it completely)']",5.00 stars
dwightfryed,"['It’s odd from US perspective to understand the draw of this album, the avalanches of praise heaped on it’s production-as-an-instrument approach and accolades for eclipsing every musical expression since the dawn of mankind with its orchestral space-prog collage. Pretty remarkable considering they don’t even play it on classic rock radio.\n\nThe band’s true strength is Yorke’s voice, and the cuts that push this remarkable mechanism to center stage dominate the proceedings. The minimalist naked guitar of “Exit Music (For a Film)” focuses the listener on his achingly elegant vocal gloom as the din of organs, drums, and other sounds swell and vanish in the background. “Karma Police” also takes full advantage of Yorke’s soaring despair as simple piano lines swell to a grand clamor in a style reminiscent of Bowie’s “Space Oddity”. The full sound of the band is best realized in the wounded, shuffling din of “Climbing Up the Walls”, bombastic orchestral racket ebbing and flowing as the song trudges to conclusion.\n\nIt’s not all great, the basslines and some of Yorke’s vocal tendencies can’t seem to shake the ghost of a bad U2 imitation. “Lucky” has the potential to be the most harrowing guitar-driven rock songs in decades (like a Britpop take on “No Quarter”) if it weren’t for a crappy chorus that drops all tension and back-built momentum like a broken elevator.\n\nIt’s an interesting record, sonically ambitious for the time period with great vocals and several strong songs, but despite what you’ve heard, it won’t cure your cancer.']",3.00 stars
TheRealTogashi,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""Let Down being my least favorite track on here by a long shot probably says more than any review I could write could. Lucky and The Tourist were unremarkable upon my first few listens, but they’re growing on me now, even though they don’t really conclude the album very well, in my opinion. Yeah, I love Fitter Happier, Electioneering, and Climbing Up the Walls. They're all fantastic tracks. Fight me.\n\nBut yeah, honestly, looking at all the reviews and comments on this album, and, in fact, all Radiohead’s stuff makes me realize that no one agrees on anything when it comes to Radiohead, it’s shocking. They are by far the most divisive band on this site. The naysayers call them overrated drivel with very little value, and the obsessives call them the best thing since Jesus Christ. And, let’s be fair, neither of these perspectives are correct.\n\nRadiohead is one of the most important bands of the 90s and 00s. No matter your feelings on them, their progression to straight-up experimentation from album to album is by far one of the greatest shifts in all of popular music history, comparable to the Beatles. And like the Beatles, they are consistently able to top the charts, even if filled with hip hop and pop acts, with every album. Most advanced artistic music wishes it could be on the Billboard period. Radiohead live the fantasy of being quite possibly the biggest rock band releasing music anymore.\n\nOn the other side of the plate, Radiohead often feels like they try too hard sometimes. Everything they write is very serious and artsy, and on most first listens to their albums, they barely click at all. Their progressive embracing is rightfully considered alienating and, in some circles, pretentious (I don’t use that word to describe things anymore, but that’s a different story). Critics would gush over a mixtape of their farts. Thom Yorke sometimes comes off as an outspoken Roger Waters figure, and a freak for the electronic, abandoning many rock conventions and allowing for the dissolution of rock in the mainstream as a result.\n\nBut man, to give this album a bad score requires some type of person, I’d think. Even from a more technical view, the production here is spot on, the electronic elements blending seamlessly with the real life band elements, coalescing into a full soundscape that can sound delicate, pretty, and frail, or overpowering, huge, and noisy.\n\nWhat is oddly prophetic to me is how perfect a transition this serves between The Bends and Kid A. The Bends is this overly emotional, wild child of an album with a lot of youth to say and plenty of time to say it. Kid A is a frozen block or transhumanism, where all that remains of that emotion is phony emulation. Whereas The Bends is genuine, Kid A is the uncanny valley, and this album serves as the bridge between them. There’s an insecurity here that’s palpable in the anxiety certain tracks here emanate. I could best compare it to a human being transformed into a machine, and fighting back in vain. And it’s chilling in its acceptance of this fate by the end, in some way.\n\nVery good album by a very good band.""]",4.50 stars
WarmGunHappy,"[""Radiohead’s success was bleaking them out. The isolation was pushing their naked skin against a cold metal until they were hopelessly scared, and then they shattered outwards. This was a natural defense mechanism, an abstract progression which had begun to lose grip on the guitar work, the strings visibly evaporating into an atmospheric fog, controlled by machines plotting their conquest. During this crisis, OK Computer stabbed up through the ground, and the people fell to their knees, instantaneously worshipping it as a historical landmark, frozen in the most important league of all albums ever made. We were no longer dealing with an ordinary band anymore, that much was certain. Make no miscalculations: without this record, Radiohead would not be a conversation. This is still the album which all of their other albums lean upon, sprouting outwards in one way or another with their own dedicated followers, but everyone—art students, simpleton radio listeners, critical publications, award ceremonies, MTV execs, Library of Congress—everyone agreed that this was a significant contribution to the very fiber of music itself. And yet... for me... it felt like the aura of devotion had outgrown the nervous system, while the devotees themselves were so delirious by its fumes that you couldn't engage in a sober dialogue about their fucking holy artifact. Please, you must believe me, I get it. It's OK Computer. It's an insult to even call this an album. But when I listen to it, I hear the restless sound of a distracted band headed somewhere else. This is a mere stopover, where Radiohead filled up with gas, checked the map, and then continued on their quest towards the boundaries of themselves.

cub1,"[""OK Computer is the kind of thing that so many clamour to have written about, that there is no unsaid thing about it. It's a really cool, inventive rock album that eschews the Britpop excesses of Oasis, it avoids big radio hits and is the poster boy for 'alternative rock'. At one point this really did stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nMoody and self-reflective, electronic-tinged art rock for people that wanted a rock album, but not a 'rock' album. Radiohead found their niche with this one, and, frankly, changed the landscape of rock music to come. There really is a before and after OK Computer. Arguably every, even-slightly, experimental rock album since OK Computer can draw a thick line back to this primordial ooze of an album.""]",4.00 stars
petricor,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""No se puede decir nada que no se haya dicho antes de este disco. Lo único que podría agregar son los “errores” que siento que tiene, y aunque sean bastante ligeros, no dejan de ser errores, al fin y al cabo.\n\nOk Computer ES un álbum conceptual. Decir que no es echar al caño todo lo hecho por este, todo el legado que cosechó; ya que después de todo este legado se basa en lo que el álbum maneja como concepto: el malestar posmoderno, la monotonía, la desolación, el consumismo; es decir, “la vida moderna”. Ahora, esta obra, al manejar y dar a expresar un concepto, no puede tener huecos conceptuales, no debe romper con el hilo que crea.\n\nEl primer error conceptual que ocurre es empezando el álbum. Si comparamos Airbag con otras canciones dentro del álbum, veremos que esta rompe con el esquema. No me malinterpretes, “Airbag” me encanta, creo que es una de las mejores canciones de Radiohead; sin embargo, como concepto creo que no va en el disco. Sí, sé perfectamente que es el retrato de la fobia de Thom a los coches, pero carece de sustancia como para dejarte con la desolación de un tiempo moderno: no pasa a ser más que una anécdota personal de Yorke. Como paréntesis: eso de que es una mirada irónica acerca de la tecnología y de como esta te puede matar y salvar al mismo tiempo, me parece una absurda sobre-conceptualización por parte del público. Nada más pretencioso.\n\nEl segundo error es seguido: Paranoid Android. Sí, aunque te duela, este es el mayor “error” dentro del álbum. Rompe totalmente con el hilo. Líricamente me parece malo, y musicalmente tampoco me parece la joya que muchos pintan. Eso de que “son tres canciones en una” o de que es “una obra compleja que retrata múltiples estados mentales” me parece pura fanfarronería. La canción no es más que una mezcla entre “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy” y una mala experiencia de Thom en un bar, pero sin saber a qué llegar: la letra es demasiada ambigua, no me logra transmitir nada en lo absoluto; y la única frase que me llamó la atención: “With your opinions, which are of no consequence at all”, fue totalmente desacreditada por Thom, quien dice que “solo era una broma. Hay que interpretar esto a la inversa: de hecho, es a veces mi opinión la que no tiene importancia” lo cual sería lo único sensato dentro de toda la canción en realidad. En cuanto a musicalidad, no me parece para nada malo, pero para nada la joya que muchos aclaman. Lo siento demasiado monótono a pesar de sus cambios de secciones, pues estas van de lo mismo, no siento una diferencia más allá del tempo. Tampoco siento un buen climax que compense los casi siete minutos, el único climax que cuenta es un solo de guitarra cual rock noventero aburrido…y además de hostigante. Lo que sí Paranoid Android hace bien es el interludio entre esta y Airbag, y el video musical que logra expresar todo lo que la canción no puede.\n\nEl último error en Ok Computer no me parece error realmente, “Exit Music (For A Film)” quizás cuente con una letra “melosa”, que choca con la temática, pero creo que esta sí se presta para múltiples interpretaciones y no me parece cerrada como las anteriores. Además, musicalmente es una joya: una lección de como hacer un buen outro que resuelva toda la tensión acumulada durante los primeros 2:50 minutos.\n\nOtro paréntesis: Electioneering para nada desentona con el disco, la letra es bastante política como para no ser parte de OKC. No sé por qué la mayoría desacredita esta si la segunda canción es un Electioneering pero de más de 6 minutos jaja.\n\nLo demás, lo resuelve bien; pero si en algo debo hacer hincapié es en una canción de la que no se habla mucho y es muy relegada: Climbing Up The Walls. Esta y Fitter Happier son la epítome de la obra, son los cortes que le dan la consistencia y le permiten ser la obra maestra que para muchos es. Climbing Up The Walls líricamente es profunda y compleja: retrata la demencia producto de un escape de los impulsos o “demonios internos”. Y, por si fuera poco, la instrumentación es espectacular; un ambiente caótico lleno de samples de emisoras, una voz distorsionada y un arreglo de cuerdas que acecha la demencia del autor hasta desembocar en un grito angustiante que representa la perdida ante esos demonios: su total demencia.\nInquietante y profunda. Solo alguien obtuso consideraría a Paranoid Android por encima de esta."", '']",4.00 stars

Como creando a un maldito Sim.\n\nEncuentro interesante que Radiohead y OK Computer, en particular, sean como la banda y el álbum, universal de nuestra generación. Es decir, hicieron muy buena música y todo, pero también tiene su mérito que en 1997, hayan pronosticado sobre cómo iba a ser la vida en el capitalismo tardío del siglo 21. Sí, es obvio que quizás otros autores hablaron de ello muchos años antes de este lanzamiento, pero no en la manera, ni en una escala tan popular como lo hizo OK Computer.\nLo que quiero decir, es que es interesante que un disco, con una tan potente temática de alienación, sea de los más apreciados de la generación que ha experimentado más tiempo dentro del Internet. Es el target directo. Supongo que valoramos la obras que nos relatan detalladamente nuestras solitarias vivencias.\n\nPor otro lado, hay algo en lo que no puedo dejar de pensar. La verdad es que no encuentro tan cool haber profetizado sobre el futuro allá en 1997. Siento que esconde una profunda desolación. Me refiero a que sí, es verdad, influenciaron a muchas bandas y artistas, pero ustedes han sentido esa sensación cuando dices: ""MMH esto va a salir horrible"", y termina saliendo horrible?

TommyJeremy,"['Update 16/09\n\nTo credit OK Computer as the best album of the 90s and perhaps of all time is somewhat if a far reaching statement. I think if anything OK Computer was the best album at its right time, along with many other classics. Yes, it’s a classic, both in terms of significance and musical progress and it did set the bar really high in rock.\n\nBut with The Bends, Radiohead had already set that bar high. It’s just that not as many people were watching. You have to remember that OK Computer was introduced by Romeo + Juliet, so when Paranoid Android came out all ears were listening, including America.\n\nThere is no doubt this was a fantastic album and was the pop album that everyone had been waiting for for a long time since maybe U2’s Joshua Tree. Why? Apart from hip hop and post grunge bullshit, Oasis having majorly proved to the world they were a flunk, the spot was there to be taken and Radiohead seized the opportunity with balls and belief, probably not expecting the reaction the album has managed to generate up until now. U2 had been the biggest band in the world, but with OK Computer it was all over. There was a new Sheriff in town.\n\nAnd the truth is that when I first heard Paranoid Android I realise how much more there was then just pop beauty. These guys were abstract, deep, conceptual and thematic. So not only did the music sound great, it was also saying something, which fit perfectly in the fear and uncertainty of the computer age. In short, Radiohead were\ntaking their ideas far beyond their melodies in The Bend into a modern rock vision, and it paid off because the whole world was waiting for it.\n\nMusically, OK Computer is arguably even better than Kid A. The band push themselves, introduce instrumental, art, prog and incorporate it with electronic influences. It’s a real leap of faith. Sometimes though, it just falls short such as in the meandering Let Down or the Nine Inch Nails influenced Climbing up the walls.\n\nBut if OK Computer dies have its moments, in its peaks it will leave you speechless. Paranoid Android is the modern day Pink Floyd Bohemian Rhapsody, Exit Music is the perfectly crafted ballad, Fitter Happier is post modern poetry, and Lucky gives Wish You Were Here a decent run for its money.\n\nElsewhere the album dies fall in the somewhat commercial side but still excellent singles “no surprises” and “karma police”. Karma Police is the Beatles beauty all over, but not done by a try hard band like Oasis. In fact it’s a little bit too close to Sexy Sadie but that’s ok because it’s an instant hit.\n\nSo yeah, OK Computer. The album that everyone raves about, the number one album of the 90s and of all time fir some critics. The album was just at the right place at the right time. Radiohead striked when the iron was hot, and they did it with a real focused plan. From there on in, they had grabbed the musical industry by the halls and the world was their command. They could literally drop shit and the world was buying it....because they had the guts of saying something to the world that not many bands could or had been able to.\n\nAt that point, every rock/indie wanted to be Radiohead, sound like Radiohead and follow their footsteps. Coldplay, Muse, Travis, hell even Placebo. No one would be able to knock them off the podium.\n\nThey owned rock line no other band. They turned it into their sound. Period.\n\n———-\n\n\nin hindsight, it does sound like it was in its time and I have discovered many other bands around at the same time that were also doing daring things, so I can’t say it’s the best album if the 90s. It’s a very good album, but I think in terms of the actual songs and their beauty, the Bends is all of it and OK Computer loses some if that beauty because if the bass appeal and commercialism around it.\n\nLet’s face it Karma Police is not anything new if you have heard Sexy Sadie, Climbing Up The Walls is very Achtung Baby reminiscent and Let Down is nothing spectacular, in my opinion.\n\nBut that’s not what I love about OK Computer, it’s the atmosphere and message. When Tom Yorke sings about bring back to save the universe (from music and trite) he is spot on, when he screams out “uptight” in Subterrenean Homesick Blues it really does sound like he is calling out the neurosis of the world, and when he sings Exit Music it’s really an apocalyptic ballad.\n\nBut that’s not the most touching part of the album. Who would have thought a poem on existentialism narrated by a computerised vocoder would have come accross as so real, so frightening and so powerful as on Fitter Happier, which is actually just an interlude.\n\nIt’s that which OK Computer will be always remembered for, the reality of the 20th century malaise that had never ever been so apparent as the decade was ending and the cold cruel and emotionless computer age was slowly creeping in.\n\nCall it a premonition, a vision, a prophecy but OK Computer May just be the most relevant album ever made.\n\nThe the world needed this.']",4.50 stars

Its praise is like Kanye West talking to himself walking in a hallway of mirrors.\n\nHowever, there are the few aforementioned ones who pray to the shiny brass quote and relish in it. There is something to be said about finding something that you find special. It attaches you and never goes away. I admit that I am one of these individuals, despite only listening to it every once in awhile & moving on from it. Most people I have connected with in my life have never heard of it. My self-proclaimed favorite album has been shared to some of my closest friends, but unfortunately for me, none of them care as much for it as I do. I want to share it and wish people would love it as much as I do, but perhaps it is simply not for most people; the ones in the museum who walk on by, not caring about the shiny quote on the wall. That\'s okay. I know there are plenty of others who share the love for it.']",5.00 stars

Lucasstevens,"['""Ok Computer"" es considerado uno de los mejores y más influyentes álbumes de los 90 y de la historia de la música. La verdad es que es excelente e incluso consiguió superar al notable ""The Bends"". Fue innovador por su sonido influenciado por la electrónica y por las alusiones a la tecnología y alienación del mundo moderno (el título es elocuente). Cuenta con grandes singles como Paranoid Android, Karma Police, No Surprises (curioso video con Thom con la cabeza en una pecera que se llena de agua) y Lucky (aparecida antes en un álbum benéfico para Warchild). Otras preciosidades son Let Down y el gran final The Tourist (qué bien canta!). El único punto negro es un experimento de menos de dos minutos que no me gusta nada. Obra puente entre el pop-rock de sus inicios y la época más electrónica que iniciarían con ""Kid A"".\n\nEstá reedición del 20 aniversario añade un segundo CD llamado ""NOTOK"" con ocho caras B (notables A Reminder y Polyethylene) y tres inéditas que muestran la inspiración de Radiohead en esa época y cuyos nombres son I Promise, Man of War y Lift (ya la había escuchado en versión en directo), las dos primeras tuvieron videoclip.

rickthelai,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'these days i flip-flop with my feelings about this album but like everybody you\'ll ever see on this site, it does mean plenty to me and my memory.\n\nthe feeling of paranoia is pretty spot-on in a lot of areas (the ending of ""karma police"" and its gradual sense of a darkness creeping up on you, the whole of ""climbing up the walls"") and in others it\'s quite arsey (""fitter happier"" isn\'t one of the best demonstrations of it here, i feel...). but you gotta contextualise it all for sure. this would\'ve felt powerful as fuck back then - the narrator notices how oppressive and draining capitalism is, that there is no choice but to commit to it in order to survive, and that no people with authority are truly willing to sympathise and help because authority comes with abuseable power and complacency with the way that things are: these observations are ones that every person goes through especially at the age that most get into radiohead anyways, coinciding with a time when most crave a new emotional and conceptual pulse in alternative music, hence its consistent connection to every generation of kids who see radiohead as the people at the forefront of boundary-pushing music. you can argue all day about the details of that but the fact is that folks, like i, still swoon at the thought of the chorus of ""lucky"" and that the tenderness of ""no surprises"" in light of its suffocating, seriously sad (and suicidal) subject matter hits a unique emotional place.\n\ni’m less interested in the specificity of the whole ‘navigating the digital world’ concept and instead i appreciate the instances that thom yorke applies these feelings of paranoia to - the fear of the car’s airbag failing to save him from a crash (“airbag”), the skin-crawling sense that somebody’s eyes are watching you (“climbing up the walls”), imposter syndrome (“subt. homesick alien”). and yet still there are brief moments of euphoria, like epiphanies where it all falls into place. the times when the album is fully submerged in stagnant pessimism are when it feels shallow, not solely because of the pessimism but because there is no light to contrast the dark, and those moments of contradiction create radiohead’s smartest songs, honestly. i\'m not sure i listen to ok computer very often anymore, but the creative decisions on it are fairly out-there, so it\'s quite a neat album for so many people to have as a starting point into \'alternative\' music.']",3.50 stars

Colquhouny,"['What to say about an album that has already had so much written about it? The occasion of this boxset release was certainly a surprise. Such nostalgic looking-back was not something I ever expected from a band that is notoriously anal about what they do and do not release. That being said, I am not complaining. This boxset is a thing of beauty. Previous ""special editions"" have often irritated me. Much of Radiohead\'s catalogue that I own sits apart from the rest of my collection simply for its awkwardness - newspaper albums, discboxes, newspaper albums, 10"" reissues that always felt like the object got in the way of the listening experience rather than complimenting it. Novelty for its own sake. However, here, for the first time, it feels truly justified.\n\nOK Computer was the first Radiohead album that I heard and fell in love with. I have very fond memories of sitting in the backseat of my parents\' car and begging them to play it. (Luckily for me, they enjoyed it too.) Then, digging into the album\'s impressive b-sides made me fall in love with the band itself - not just it\'s recorded output, but its ethos and its consistency; the very idea of the band itself.\n\nWhat band has b-sides like this? My first nascent attempt to start a band of my own in my teens began with a collective listening session during which we all shared our favourite songs. I played Polyethylene. ""This is a b-side?!"" was the incredulous response. Lull and How I Made My Millions, likewise, remain for me two of the band\'s most serene tracks. The demo quality of How I Made My Millions in particular still knocks me off my feet - the sound of Yorke\'s late wife Rachel unpacking shopping in the background now all the more affective.\n\nFor me, the best thing about this release is the ""white cassette"". The album and its b-sides are amazing. I knew that already and having them collected together in one package is a lovely thing but now, with this mysterious cassette, I find myself rediscovering this band all over again. The three bonus tracks - I Promise, Man of War and Lift - are a nice touch but rightly left of the album and its singles. The live versions that have been circulating for over a decade remain unmatched. However, the experience of listening to the white cassette recaptures the astonishment of my first listen to How I Made My Millions. The experiments and demos collected here are of an astounding quality. Recognising motifs later recycled on later material is so moving to me as a long-time fan. Piano motifs later heard on Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors are wonderful to hear - and surprising, considering this beautiful instrumental piece would become one of the band\'s most jarring and difficult listens. The demos of unknown songs are as strong as any other b-side from the period. The Penderecki-esque violin piece that could be (or perhaps is) a version of a track from There Will Be Blood. A version of Climbing Up The Walls that, at first, felt to me like something from 20 Jazz Funk Greats. This whole cassette is less a fragmentary audio-diary of the OK Computer sessions and more of a sign of what was to come. Kid A and Amnesiac feel less like the massive stylistic shift they are made out to be now. This boxset has rekindled my love not only of OK Computer but those albums and their b-sides as well.\n\nThere is little else to say right now. I am writing this as I listen to the remastered album and the cassette for the first time. What strikes me is that this album feels new again. I feel 13 again. There will be others out there who are far more rigorous with their detective work, identifying every fragment - I look forward to an imagined http://citizeninsane.eu analysis of these sounds and notebooks - but, speaking for myself, I am ready to pour over this album all over again. It is rare that a remastered anniversary release rekindles that kind of fire. The Radioheads of 1997 and 2017 have truly outdone themselves - quite literally.']",5.00 stars

Metal2,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Although many on this site talk about this album to a more personal level by the affection of it, well fuck, I also decide to put it that way. First of all, this goes to a completely personal view, in the reasoning of why I love this album, and why it is my favorite ever, which what I\'ll elaborate more on is my affection in it.\n\nThis album gave some supposedly radical changes to my emotional and even auditory sense in music, although I had known for a long time that there will be that style of music ""dark and deeper"" that made me remain in a repulsion towards those who presume. Well, they still disgust me, but at least thanks to those I was able to recognize more the things they talk about that surprised me by listening to them, good recommendations no doubt. But this record, OK Computer, had come out of nowhere and I\'m surprised that it has still given me an extraordinary affection, which then has caused me more interest in the band after that.\n\nTheir first song, it wasn\'t Airbag, but Paranoid Android, that song that surprisingly identified me to an extreme degree by the simple fact of their transition from mystery, to energy, to humor and even I would say melancholy, but then I realized that this project in general gave me that emotion. After that it was even Karma Police and then No Surprises. Karma Police gave me as a feeling of sarcasm, but at the same time hopelessness, while No Surprises, well, has given me the tone of the famous depression, which is the one that hits me the most throughout the project.\n\nNow I can talk about the album in general, it was clear that I would listen to their singles with those music videos, and I must say it gave me an even more extraordinary journey than I expected. To start off, I removed the year on this album with the simple fact of being very meticulous in vocals and production, that I can not even notice that the era it came out. The opening track, Airbag, a track that still makes me love the intro guitar too much, plus the sound of bells in the background, and then the drumming that gives great power with its produced and edited sound. Thom\'s vocals throughout this album have given me a great thought for their emotion and expression through these 12 songs, which have made me obsess even more with this album for the lyrics that unite it completely. Paranoid Android, as I mentioned, is the song that has given me a huge identity to me, for the simple fact of the lyrics more than anything, however, in addition, its instrumentation, the three movements, gave me a great trip to my own self, with humor, sarcasm, anger and paranoia. Subterranean Homesick Alien, at first I had a doubt if I really liked it, but then I discovered it in a very short time. I love its psychedelia in rhythm and distorted melody, the calm he puts in a story that puts existentialism makes me laugh, and at the same time i\'m interested. After that calm, I have to say that Exit Music (For A Film), has made me wonder more with the way of this project, with its acoustic melody that gives me a greater calm, but then to give more power with its tone more Technological in its production, makes me feel in a huge fall. I still could not believe what Let Down introduced me with that introduction. The melody, the stress of the lyrics, the desolation in those vocals made me feel more hopeless than Karma Police, a greater effect than I really expected. Karma Police, also said before, had a more sarcastic feeling, but that has kept me that emotion that gave me Let Down. What I love the most about the theme is the keyboard, at slow pace, it makes me feel even calmer. But if there is something that surprised me more, it\'s simply with the arrival of Fitter Happier. The disturbing lyrics, a traumatic melody, and with those robotic vowels only gave me a trauma for what is said, could even say that I was scared by what I was dealing with, which also gave me fear of the following to my personality, until then Electioneering appears. You know? I can not say I was disgusted at the first time, because it was one of my most favorites on the record, I can understand them to be the blandest, with lesser production in the rest of this trip, but I love the power of their Alternative Rock, which gives me a great energy, thanks to that it showed me the feeling of motivation more than anything, even if it is a political issue, I love his expression in it, full of desire to say it all at once. I love Electioneering, but even more I started to adore more this album with its next track Climbing Up The Walls. The psychopathy in this song made me shiver, especially in its production, full of dementia and harassment, which makes me feel like the victim of the story, and the scream at the end gave me chills to have a powerful end. No Surprises, that theme comes from everything I heard, is the one that ""hurts me"" let\'s just say. If Let Down makes me feel hopeless, No Surprises puts me in a downward spiral, although it has never existed in my life, it gives me the feeling that I have it. The song that goes towards tiredness and dissatisfaction, gives great effect on one, although clearly depending on your mood. This song, however, I prefer to hear it with the rest of the album, because the trip that puts me with this theme only makes me feel even less bad to hear it. It\'ll sound a bit terrible, but in the end this is how the song made me feel the first time I heard it, now it does not give me an enormous affection as mentioned above, but it gives me a more pleasing love towards it for the production and lyrics. After that comes Lucky, which gives me a feeling much less dense, a little energetic, but at the same time calm, and with it I feel more relieved after that great trip that has given me this record. I do not say much of this because it gives me a calmer and less hard pass. This album has given me a great feeling: paranoia, stress, sarcasm, desolation, energy, tranquility and, above all, melancholy. It has given me a great sense to my identity that makes me feel very grateful, and best of all is how The Tourist, their last song, made me see how in life anything happens. The subject is about a driver angry at traffic, probably will not make sense of what makes me feel, but it gives me the perspective that the event will always happen, and the only thing that needs to be done to solve it, is to let it happen, because it will happen in another time, and that\'s what gives us the daily life.\n\nThe trip that has OK Computer is what has given me a huge obsession with this album. Its density in its themes with that production, vocals and lyrics, the concept, the 12 stories presented in it, is the reason why it has given me such emotion to it, and that\'s why it\'s my favorite of all time. Simply a beautiful album.\n\nFavorite Track: Paranoid Android']",5.00 stars

ClipsMcGrips,"[""Radiohead seem to occupy this perfect space between pop music and true avant-garde music, without really being either. They're less experimental than they are recontextualizing pop music by incorporating moderate elements of the avant-garde, thus keeping their sound interesting while still being accessible for more average/casual listeners. I think this is what causes them to garner so much hate from snobbier music fans, because diehard Radiohead fans proclaim Radiohead's music to be avant-garde artistic masterpieces.

BadLieutenant96,"['1. Airbag\nWhen I’m listening to OK Computer all the way through and Airbag starts up with that clear, sharp lead guitar, I get the same feeling of sitting in a movie theater right before the movie starts. It’s a combination of anticipation, and a weird feeling of comfort knowing you’re about to experience something, a work of art that a bunch of talented people spent a lot of time and money making, all for you to lose yourself in. Maybe that’s a bit pretentious, but the reputation of OK Computer as the best album of all time along with its thematic overtones makes every listening experience a bit more elevated than what you get from your typical album. Oh, the song itself is great- that solo is pure rock grandeur, balanced out with the DJ Shadow influenced distorted drumming and Colin Greenwood’s eminently hummable bass. When the guitar soars up in the second part of the solo, it’s the first of many moments of the album that send chills down my spine. Backtracking a bit, I also love the way Yorke holds off on singing the title of the song until the second verse, dropping the catchphrase worthy line “an airbag saved my life” at the perfect moment right before he launches back into the chorus. It’s one of those “omg he said the title!!” moments you get more often from movies, adding to the cinematic flavor of the song (for me anyways). Also, Airbag gets points just for being one of the happiest Radiohead songs. Truly triumphant and life affirming. And then: Beep, beep, beep...\n\n2. Paranoid Android\nThe first Radiohead song that showed Thom and crew were weirdos instead of just telling. If you didn’t get it from that almost queasy guitar melody and backing rhythm section (not even sure what instruments they’re using tbh), Yorke makes it obvious in his “unborn chicken voices in my head” line in the first verse. And Paranoid Android just gets weirder and more intense from there. I can get how the rock opera concept might sound corny to some (it did to me at first) but the aggressiveness sells it for me. Although sometimes it can still feel like a race to the third act meltdown, by far my favorite section. It’s the narrator coming to his senses after letting out a torrent of anger and fear, which gives the song some closure (a similar thing happens on Karma Police). A trip of a song, if you’re in the right mood for it.\n\n3. Subterranean Homesick Alien\nAs one of the more straightforward and almost playful songs on the album, Subterranean Homesick Alien functions as a bit of a breather in between two of the album’s most melodramatic escapades. In this song, spacey guitars follow Yorke’s narrator as he drives his town’s backcountry roads, wishing he would get abducted by aliens. It sounds like a cheeky concept for the band, but there is an undeniably sad context, that of the narrator’s social isolation and low self esteem. The “uptight!!!” of the chorus always struck me as Yorke trying to force himself back into reality. Like, he’ll be alright and won’t have to daydream about aliens anymore if he’d just let go of the neurotic behavior holding him back. Although it’s not as heavy as some others, there’s still a general feeling of unease throughout the song. Will you really be alright, man?\n\n4. Exit Music (For a Film)\nThere’s always a sense of “this is where shit gets real” when I get to track number 4 on OK Computer. The quiet dread of acoustic guitar (knowing what’s to come), Yorke’s pained, intimate vocal and foreboding lyrics make the first half of Exit Music among the most atmospheric on the album. The weird backing sample of what sounds like a distorted looped sample of a choir adds to the unease. All of this tension is, of course, released with Philip Selway’s perfectly timed drum fill, followed in suit by Colin Greenwood’s fuzzy bass and his brother’s lead guitar, with Yorke’s emotional wailing riding this growing wave of sound surging towards catharsis. The album’s heaviest song emotionally, with the lyrics being about the double suicide of two young lovers. Great, but not always the easiest to listen to.\n\n5. Let Down\nSo on an album where every song could function as the centerpiece on a lesser album, there’s no way the actual centerpiece could meet expectations, or even work on a conceptual level to tie everything together, right? Well, I’ve held off until song 5 to state the obvious- that all that can be said about this album has already been said, and that anyone reading this has likely already heard this album, many times probably, and my review couldn’t possibly offer any new analysis or insight. So we already know the magic of Let Down, a perfectly constructed pop song following a template that would be copied by many in coming years, but with none of its imitators coming even close to the heights Let Down ascends to. We know the feelings it inspires in us. We know the comfort the song provides, from those beautifully sentimental major key guitar and keyboards, and Yorke’s simple yet directly emotional mantras surveying the malaise and disappointment of modern life. It’s that shared sense of disconnect that’s hard to put words to. Naturally, this is a difficult concept to pull off without either sounding pretentious and losing its emotional impact, or sounding too sentimental and corny, yet Let Down strikes the perfect balance. This song has surely soundtracked many personal failures, rejections, losses, empty feelings and useless chemical reactions, be it from antidepressants or endorphins during a workout. And hopefully it has also been that badly needed pick-me-up, with its silver lining mantra “one day I am gonna grow wings” offering some perhaps knowingly naive hope, but hope nonetheless.\n\n6. Karma Police\nNow that sorrow turns to bitterness on the next track, perhaps the album’s most well known. Yorke is now calling for karma to hurry up and serve justice to those who talk in maths and don hitler hairdos.. so yeah, he’s being weird again, but disconnect from reality is made even more palpable. This all building to the great release in the final third of the song, which is not so much carefully built up to like the climaxes of Exit Music or Climbing Up the Walls but more a sudden switch, change of pace like on Paranoid Android. On a more personal note, for some reason whenever I listen to this song in the gym I find it impossible not to lip-sync with that “phew for a minute there, I lost myself” section. I’ve no idea why and I probably look like a twat but it’s just too emotional. Which also leads me to another point, maybe not brought up before about this album- these songs are all great to lift weights to, as they pretty much all feature progression and build up towards the most cathartic moment, that emotional release that you can time your set to. In fact I’d say a song like Exit Music is optimally designed for lifting weights, since you’re at rest for most of the song until the final third explosion, which you’d time your set to. Try it out!\n\n7. Fitter Happier\nSpeaking of lifting weights... well, this interlude has long been considered the lowpoint of the album, a useless and momentum killing dirge of a computerized voice reading off a paradigm of modern living that gets progressively weirder. It’s a rare moment on the album that I feel they’re trying too hard to get their point across. I mean, it’s short enough so as not to grate too much, and I guess an interlude might be in order since the first half of this album was so emotionally draining, but I wish they’d have stuck an instrumental like the Meeting in the Aisle b-side here instead. Not to suggest how to improve what is widely considered the greatest album of all time or anything...\n\n8. Electioneering\nThe most upbeat song on the album, and another one that’s maybe a bit too on the nose, this time with political themes, but still enjoyable for its catchy chorus. And heck, these lyrics are relevant today days as the president of my country is currently under an FBI investigation for his ties to Russia and their hacking of our presidential election. Or, simply because there’s too much money in politics these days to begin with. Anyways, a fine song that, for its flaws, still lends OK Computer a wider context.\n\n9. Climbing up the Walls\nMy second or third favorite Radiohead song right here, and my favorite from OK Computer. This is, perhaps, the sound of someone who has “finally lost it completely” as foreshadowed on Subterranean Homesick Alien. The lyrics are from the perspective of a stalker and are directed towards his victim in the chilling chorus “either way you turn/ I’ll be there/ Open up your skull/ I’ll be there”. The filter over Yorke’s vocal (not unlike the one Maynard James Keenan used on Stinkfist) helps to mask his typically sweet, distinctive singing voice, and his high register emoting is pushed to the limit with that final scream. The buildup to that climax sees Johnny Greenwood’s brilliant string orchestration add a layer of cinematic tension to the claustrophobia. The wailing guitar sounds like an alarm going off, and those thunderous drums sound like what I imagine the hailstorm outside of the studio they were recording this song in must’ve sounded like. The extended comedown is also chilling, sounding like something off of Boards of Canada’s Geogaddi. Absolutely mental tune. Maybe not always the best song to listen to for someone with a penchant for obsessively thinking about certain people, but this song represents the absolute opposite end of the spectrum of madness and insanity that one sometimes becomes morbidly curious to just take a peek at, yknow? Like the old cliche that there’s a sinister nature in all of us that thankfully is kept in check by societal norms, healthy relationships, etc. Well here it is. A nightmare to be sure.\n\n10. No Surprises\nAnd the nightmare ends with the warm, childlike tone of glockenspiel softly waking us back to our normal lives. Or maybe I’ve just grown to associate the opening seconds of this song with waking up as I’ve used it as my alarm for the past year or so. Like Let Down, this song utilizes sweet major key melodies despite its lyrical content being quite depressing. This is the anthem for the emotionally vacant working class life, and although Yorke’s lyrics are deeply sarcastic (“such a pretty house! Such a pretty garden!”) they are concealing a lot of sadness and dissatisfaction (the backing chant of “get me outtta here!”). Great tune. The video is also one of my all time favorites.\n\n11. Lucky\nIf No Surprises was Radiohead’s dark take on The Beach Boys, then Lucky is their Pink Floyd bid. Admittedly it’s more straightforward than typical progressive rock (and perhaps better off for it) but those psychedelic guitars and grand solo sound straight out of the 70s art rock playbook. This feels a bit Airbag-lite, but it does stir some of the same triumphant emotions in its second verse, especially the line “it’s gonna be.... a GLOOOOORIOUS day”. I also love the lyric “kill me Sarah, kill me again with love” mostly because I have a soft spot for anytime an artist sings to an actual name (Yorke would do it again on the In Rainbows b-side Go Slowly- “Oh Maria...”).\n\n12. The Tourist\nAnd so we reach the end of our journey through the various crises and stresses of modern life with another song centered around driving. This time it’s from the perspective of someone watching a reckless driver, urging them to slow down. I don’t really have much to say about this song, other than it hasn’t quite grown on me like the other songs have, but it’s a good way to end the album. I believe I read somewhere they were originally intending to include Motion Picture Soundtrack, which had been floating around since The Bends era, as the final song here. Well I’m glad they had the sense to see it wouldn’t quite have fit on this album, and especially glad they would swap the acoustic guitar for organ and harp when including it as the closer to their next album. It’s probably the most beautiful thing they’ve ever done. But I’m getting sidetracked. The Tourist I guess just isn’t very interesting to talk about, since it’s relatively straightforward alt rock with more guitar lines and emotional singing from Yorke.\n\nI’ll wrap up this monstrously long review by saying I absolutely 100% agree with OK Computer’s reputation as the greatest album of all time. It’s not favorite, not my even my favorite Radiohead album, but it just feels bigger and more important than any other record they’d do.\n\nLike, fuck man. This is it. They really did it.']",4.50 stars

A very welcome reprieve from the mundanity of most commercial rock music.\n\nUnfortunately, the members of Radiohead seem to have as much anxiety about their own instrumental competence as they have about everything else.

FarqinA1997,"[""What can I say about this album that hasn’t been said a million times already? This is such a culturally ingrained and beloved album and countless publications and critics have sung its praises and explained the cultural impact that OK Computer has had on the genre of alternative rock and the world of music in general. This is one of those rare albums that lives up to the hype, and 21 years later, hasn’t lost any of its impact or sounded dated at all. The themes of alienation from your fellow man due to the overabundance of technology and the dissatisfaction with society as a result of that has only grown stronger with time. This is one of those albums that seems to be a personal favorite for many, not only because the music is fantastic, but because they have some attachment to it because of the time of their life they heard it during or how it helped them come to terms with their alienation from society or depression. For me, this album has always been cathartic as I’ve always felt detached from other people to some extent, but this album found new meaning to me when it sort of soundtracked the beginning of the most important relationship of my life, with a girl who accepted and loved me for everything I was, regardless of my detachment from my fellow man.\n\nEnough about my views on the cultural impact or my personal attachment to the album for now, let’s get to the music, which is absolutely fantastic. This is a collection of 12 perfectly constructed tracks without a single lull, even Fitter Happier works to build on the greater theme of the album as a whole. We start off with Airbag, a great opener that sets the stage for what is to come, the guitars are almost chilly, as the drums work behind them to give the album a strange and multi layered introduction. The guitar work really is something to behold right out of the gate as various layers of different guitar lines are seamlessly put on top of each other to create a great soundscape, and this is only the first track. Next we have what many have considered alternative’s Bohemian Rhapsody: Paranoid Android. This song carries on the soundscape elements of the first track, at least in the first part of the song, backed up by the monotonous robotic voice found in Fitter Happier. The mix up into the raw and explosive rif throughout the middle of the track and the subsequent winding down into a beautiful and off putting chorus in the background of Thom singing about rain falling from a great height never ceases to amaze me. This is probably the most popular song on the album, and for good reason, it never has lost its impact even after at least 50 listens of it over all my times revisiting this album.\n\nAfter that track comes to a close we have the atmospheric and psychedelic Subterranean Homesick Alien, a track that sounds like floating through the great cosmic clouds of a supernova while missing home. The Miles Davis influence on this song is pretty clear, as the whole track has undertones of jazz fusion and abstraction throughout the instrumental choices and mood that the choices leave you with. The track always gives me a sense of wonder and alienation, in the same way Thom talks about this alienation throughout the lyrics of the track. Next we have the seminal and ever sad track Exit Music (For a Film) a song made famous by its use at the end of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet and more recently at the end of the Black Mirror episode Shut Up and Dance. This track is probably the saddest and most chilling track on the entire album, the chilling nature of this song is even reflected in the lyrics as Thom says “Sing us a song to keep us warm, there’s such a chill, such a chill”. The song is gentle for the first half but still carries a strong mood into the end where the background is filled by strange sounds that brings the mood even further down until it just explodes into a even more chilling and intense crescendo of haunting emotion. It never fails to send a shiver down my spine, and is the perfect ending of a song to transition into my favorite song on the album and favorite Radiohead song of all time - Let Down\n\nI could write an entire article about why I love Let Down, but I’ll keep it as short and succinct as I can. The guitars are so breathtakingly beautiful and play in different time signatures against each other as the drums drive them forward, the vocals on the other hand are so beautiful and complementary to the chilling instrumental that the two go together like bread and butter, this is what Radiohead has always been best at in my opinion. They quickly establish a complex yet emotionally impactful mood that they can gradually work upon to perfection, and reach a high that leaves you speechless and in awe of the incredible craftsmanship you have just heard. Thom’s lyrics reflect what it’s like to be such a small insignificant human in a world of transportation, people going to all kinds of places and the world moving so fast as you stand so still, and the disappointment that comes from feeling separate from this infinitely complex world of individuals attempting to get places. He uses a metaphor of a bug getting crushed in the ground to extend this feeling of emptiness into the fact that our insignificance and expectations are often too sentimental for our own good and end up being worthless drivel. The end of this song, after the instrumental winds down is honestly one of my favorite moments in music. The combination of the guitars coming back in in full force, the building and Thom’s vocals soaring over the top, on top of himself is absolutely gorgeous. The part where he hits that perfect falsetto always gets me (despite this song’s lyrics) sentimental and sends wave after wave of shivers down my spine, I’m also not afraid to say this song has gotten me emotional more than once. Overall this track is absolutely my favorite Radiohead song and one of the best moments in music in the 90’s, and the climax of the album, and the most flawless song to be the climax as well.\n\nThe next few songs are great, with Karma Police being another incredibly famous song from the album, which continues the strong mood of the record. Fitter Happier always gives me shivers too, but mostly because the mood is so disturbing and reflective of how uniform and horrifying the idea of always trying to stay happy and meet the status quo can be. We’re all expected to follow all of these rules towards what makes us a good member of society when ultimately all it does is restrict us, make us less individualistic and distract us from the fact that the system is fucking us all while making it seem like we benefit from it. It has a great message but sometimes I can’t really face the song as the mood it puts me in is to opposite to the one I get from the next track Electioneering, which is probably the best straight up rock song on the album, and it always gets my blood pumping. Electioneering and Climbing Up the Walls are two great songs with great production but as songs the stick out the least to me on the tracklist, because the other tracks are so standout in comparison. No Surprises is another standout single from this album, it contrasts the lullaby-esque quality of the instrumental and vocals versus the antagonistic and cynical lyrics about the destructive effect of our endless and demeaning jobs as the government decides everything for us. We should stand up for ourselves, but in this world it’s often too much to ask for people to become impassioned enough to change so we just passively deal with the cycle of a life where nothing we do matters and no one cares. A great single and transition into my second favorite track on the album, Lucky.\n\nLucky is a lot of things for me, it’s a sad dirge of a song with guitars that wail, almost like they’re crying and a vocal performance and lyrics that sound pretty much hopeless, but it’s also a song that connects me to one of the most passionate moments of my life. It was a bitter cold saturday in Wisconsin, despite the fact that it was mid April we had just had a huge blizzard, and even though it was hugely impractical I was set on seeing the girl I had been dating. I met her on a greyhound bus, and had developed such a strong bond with her that even mountains of snow in the road wasn’t going to stop me from seeing her. We drove to the mall, and listened to this album in the parking lot, and during our listen, we passionately made out during this track and The Tourist. This girl would go on to be the first serious relationship I’ve had in 4 years and is my current girlfriend, so Lucky is our song. It’s our song by circumstance but I think that the fact that this song ended up being our song is, not to make a pun, lucky. Lucky really captures the feelings I for over a year before I met her, and I felt the desolation of this track’s lyrics, I just wish someone could’ve pulled me out of the suffering of my life, and she did.\n\nThe Tourist, is the best ending to this album that anyone could’ve asked for and I honestly think it’s the most underrated song on the album by far. It’s so hauntingly beautiful and reflective, it’s such a fitting ending to the album as a whole. The album started off with a bang and ends on a reflective melancholic little tune that I think captures what OK Computer is about: wistful reflection on the alienation of your life perfectly matched to grand yet sentimental and chilling cerebral instrumentals. OK Computer isn’t just my favorite Radiohead album, it’s one of my all time favorite albums to ever be released my man, the fact that it’s number 1 on this site makes a lot of sense, as it’s obvious to me that this album is most important to those who see that music can change your life, that it’s not just something to put on in the background. The album has rightfully been remembered by history for what it is: one of the most important albums of all time, a decade defining and momentous peak of what alternative rock was and still is, and one of the ideals of what music can achieve. It’s one of the few albums I would say is absolutely perfect, and I would recommend anyone trying to get into music beyond what their friends and family listen to give this masterpiece a listen, it’s absolutely an essential listen for everyone.""]",4.50 stars

brutuslevi,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""There's nothing bad with pretentious art, as long as the artist fulfill his pretension. 'OK Computer' deserves bombastic crowns: it's universal, it's futuristic, it's well made to it's smallest details; but it's music and lyrics are rarely reach the high standards that the themes deserves.\n\nThe main theme of the album is the sci-fi motive of cyborg, the human-computer combination, which is the theme of some of the best popular records, like Laurie Anderson's 'Big Science' and kraftwerk's 'Computer World' and 'The Man Machine'. Here, the Man-machine oxymoron is mostly expressed with the dialog between warm rock ensemble, lead by Jonny Greenwood's guitar, and electronic instruments, pads and effects. The combination is often tiring, with too dominant guitar and unoriginal use of the effects, like the stupid vocoder in 'Fitter-Happier' with it's formulary text and the annoying whining guitar parts and solos in 'Lucky' and in 'Climbing Up the Walls'.\n\nSometimes it works, especially in the less heavy tracks of the album, when the guitar is less taking-over, and the electronic parts are based on quiet pads or small touches followed by smooth keyboards, like in beautiful 'Let down', classic 'Karma police' and worn, yet touching, 'No Surprises' (and 'Paranoid Android', in which the acoustic guitar takes the part of the keyboard). Theses tunes express perfectly the melancholy, alienated feeling that the suicidal cliches in the lyrics of 'Exit music', for instance, fail to reach. The lyrics of the album, however, are rarely understood because of Thom Yorke's floating-spreading singing, that a whole generation of rockers tried to duplicate in a despair attempt to reach RYM top 100.\n\nThe album contains one pearl, that stands in the front of Radiohead resume. 'Airbag' is based on an amazing drum riff, that in a way is opposite to the beat of the melody (especially the thrilling tremolo guitar verse and Thom Yorke's slow melody). This conflict is Radiohead secret weapon. It makes Radiohead's best songs masterpieces, especially some of the songs in 'Kid A', 'King of Limbs' and 'In Rainbows'. The tremolo makes the song, the riff is brilliant, The solo and the effects are fantastic and the whole song is a display of Greenwood at his top. The lyrics are only a cover, sub-text-less and direct declarations that express the yearning for a new birth, 'an interstellar burst', as a mechanic person. The music is filled with passion for renewal, and express perfectly not only the pre millennium atmosphere but Radiohead's rebirth as a post-britpop electronic ensemble. Radiohead has surely designed the sound of the new decade, But two months after the release of OK Computer, a new album has released, a perfect masterpiece that represented far more innovative combination of electronic and non-electronic music: 'Homogenic' by bjork.""]",3.50 stars

The mixing and the arrangements (the violins on ""Climbing up the Walls""!) are gorgeous and lambent, exemplifying a level of attentiveness that must have felt like a breath of fresh air in the late 90s.

Yet as i\'ve lived the last 20 years with Ok Computer i\'ve grown to realize that my main gripe with Ok Computer isn\'t really the suffocating production rather it\'s the quality of the songwriting on show.\n\nIt\'s easy to see why Ok Computer is so loved, it\'s beautifully sequenced and musically it\'s nigh on perfect unlike most of those Prog bands Radiohead very rarely stray off into pointless interludes that serve only to show us their musical abilities, always serving the song perfectly. The guitars in particular always seem to hit the right note, find the right texture and colour these songs in a way few other bands are able to. I just wish the songs were less inconsistent and that the album had more tone than the grey that seems to strangle it from first note to last, almost every song here is mid to slow tempo and coupled with Yorke\'s nasally whine can get a little hard to get through, the run from ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" through to ""Electioneering"" is pretty tough going for me, the last song is the only genuine rocker on the whole record but it sounds like filler to these ears, the verses don\'t engage me and that chorus is a damp squib. In between we get a spoken word piece called ""Fitter Happier"" that gets irritating about 30 seconds in, ""Exit Music (For A Film)"" aims for devastating melancholy but comes across like self absorbed whining, ""Let Down"" is even mopier and ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" is just plain dull with perhaps the album\'s worst chorus. Which leaves the excellent ""Karma Police"", easily one of the albums best tracks, like opener ""Airbag"" it has a menacing, slightly unhinged feel to it that suits the band much better than the wallowing in misery found elsewhere however both tracks are nearly ruined by the bands artistry and refusal to finish a song without a hail of feedback and/or sound effects, they do this at least half a dozen times on this album and i\'m bored already by the second time they do it.\n\n""Paranoid Android"" is rightly hailed as one of the album\'s high points, it contains everything great about Radiohead, it\'s a complex piece of many segments that never seems unfocused, every part perfectly woven together, melodically and lyrically perfect, i think it\'s the highlight of their career singles wise and remains one of my favourite singles of all time, for a song this challenging, this intelligent to top the UK singles chart still fills me with joy.\n\nAnd i really like the album\'s run in, ""Climbing Up The Walls"" is nearly ruined by another annoyingly pointless end and ""The Tourist"" gets dangerously close to overblown 70\'s rock histrionics in it\'s close out although that ping is cool it has to be said but the former mixes a bit of a Portishead, Massive Attack and Tricky vibe to great effect whilst the latter has one of the albums best melody lines.\n\nAnd there is nothing at all wrong with either the utterly gorgeous ""No Surprises"" which contains the albums prettiest melody or the Neil Young/Crazy Horse like ""Lucky"".\n\nThere\'s absolutely no doubting Radiohead\'s talent or grasp of melody and Ok Computer has these traits writ large all over it but this is the number one album on Rate Your Music and i feel the mid section of the album is a bit of a slog and less than perfect from a songwriting perspective hence my above average rating. Still it\'s well better than most classic albums out there.']",3.50 stars

Una obsesión más que merecida para el disco más hipertrofiado de los 90. Entre la hinchazón mediática que lo elevó a los altares desde que salió y la hinchazón emocional por lo que ha significado para tanta gente, es imposible aclararse y hacerse una idea ajustada de lo que es ""OK Computer"" y hasta dónde alcanza su autenticidad.\n\nNo pasa lo mismo con sus tentáculos que se hunden sin ocultarlo en las profundidades de la cultura popular, ya sea la más elevada o la más vulgar. El disco y el grupo no ocultan sus influencias. Sería estúpido. Ahí está la huella de esa ""Guía del autoestopista galáctico"", serie británica que le presta sus androides paranóicos y le da título. Ese ""Bitches Brew"" de Miles Davis que trataron de invocar en ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" (título inspirado en una de Bob Dylan, por cierto), pero que les salió más bien The Beatles. Esa ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (Queen) en la que dicen haberse inspirado para los cambios de ""Paranoid Android"" y tantas y tantas otras referencias que hervían en la cabeza y las manos de un grupo que se muestra aquí a punto de explosionar.\n\nEste era sólo su tercer disco, un poco pronto tal vez para derrochar la inspiración melódica, el tino expresivo y el concepto que yace en esta obra. Sorprendente sobre todo cuando nos dejamos llevar y disfrutamos de la enorme cantidad de detalles que tiene, que son los que lo hacen tan grande. Ese bajo a medio tocar, que se calla cuando no debe, casi dub, de ""Airbag"", la guitarra rota por la distorsión que parte en dos ""Paranoid Android"", los melotrones aquí y allá, la calma suicida de ""Exit Music"" (para la película ""Romeo + Juliet"" de Baz Luhrmann), el cambio melódico en ""Karma Police"" (dos canciones en una) que es capaz de hacerme levitar, el piano perdido de ""Fitter Happier"", la distorsión radical de ""Electioneering"", la parquedad terminal de ""Climbing Up the Walls"", la melodía de caja de música de ""No Surprises"", ese ""We are standing on the edge"" que se cae de la boca agotada de Thom, y tantos y tantos detalles que hacen único a este álbum y merecedor de toda su adhesión incondicional.\n\nMucho se ha hablado de su concepto y de las ideas que trata de transmitir. No es baladí este tema porque tal vez esa es la clave para entender porqué ha conectado tan bien con el público cuando, no lo olvidemos, sus ventas en EE.UU. fueron subestimadas a priori. No era un disco comercial, decían, pero eso no importó porque lo que cuenta nos llega al alma. ""OK Computer"" nos habla de nosotros mismos en el difícil cambio de siglo. Ataca al consumismo, a la superficialidad de las relaciones, a un mundo robótico que deshumaniza y aliena. Todo en un disco en el que Thom Yorke se jactaba de que había dejado a un lado la negatividad de su obra anterior en pos de un positivismo que no acabo de ver muy claro.\n\n""OK Computer"" tiene su sitio entre los grandes y ni Ballard ni la Velvet Underground, otras influencias fundamentales, pueden explicar esto. Seguro que es porque es una obra seria y sólida. Una de esas que se cree lo que cuenta. Y se lo cree porque lo que cuenta es importante y esencial para nuestra vida. Porque no es música de fondo, sino que exige toda nuestra atención. Y se la vamos a prestar siempre, aunque pueda sonarnos melindroso en sus juegos melódicos y en los contrapuntos vocales del llorón de Thom Yorke. Porque a pesar de sus imperfecciones, el cabrón nos gusta hasta decir basta.', '9.6']",5.00 stars

pixelmusic,"[""YOU DONT REMEMBER! YOU DONT REMEMBER! WHY DONT YOU REMEMBER MY NAME...\nto which I reply:\nOH OF COURSE I FUCKING DO. I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE NAME OF THIS MASTERPIECE.\n\nOK Computer is one of those albums where the music counts just as much as the entire experience. Seriously, from the front to the back there will be some sort of mood or some sort of memory you'll feel or recall. Starting with 'Airbag', about Thom Yorke's car accident when he was younger, this album slowly begins to take off and pull you in. If you enjoy this band or their counterparts, you'll be sucked right in and enjoy the hell out of it just like me. But if you are a casual or different genre listener, or a first timer, you'll probably be impressed with 'Airbag' slightly, but will take a while to sink in. But by the last strike of Jonny's guitar at the end of the song...\n\nboop boop boop boop\n\nPARANOID ANDROID HAPPENS. And it happens, OH IT HAPPENS. This song will most definitely grab you by the hand and yank you into the world of Yorke & co. This song was (and still is) the Bohemian Rhapsody of the 90's and was definitely another massive leap away from their debut. And think about all those people who say Radiohead 'croon' too much. YOU ARE WRONG SON! This track is most definitely one you'll never forget, as well as the rest of this album. The truth is 'Paranoid Android' is a mixture of everything good: an acoustic intro, some cool basslines, a guitar seizure, a ballad and a balls to the wall climax. This song has everything and anything. Trust me, you won't find this anywhere else in alternative rock (unless you're Muse, I'm looking at you, Citizen Erased ;))\n\nThen the third song kicks in: 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' which makes you feel as if you are floating (or hovering) above the Earth. I listened to this song just before I watched some people skydive and the two just click together so well. This song is brilliant and most certainly not 'uptight'. After this, we get the first real 'slower' and more 'melancholy' track of the album: 'Exit Music (For A Film)'. This song is just so depressingly sad and really pulls on those good ol heart-strings. But in ways this song is also very mysterious and scary, plus the fact it hints there is another track on the album like this (Climbing Up The Walls). The 'We Hope That You Choke' line is really REALLY deep. 'Let Down' arrives afterwards and is a very bittersweet addition to what has already been a journey of a record.\n\nThe bleeps and the bloops at the end of the previous song continue into 'Karma Police', one of the most recognisable Radiohead songs, and also one of their strongest songs ever. The lyrics, the melody, the corruption of the synth/keyboard at the end, it just all fits together perfectly and beautifully. In fact, I'd say it was one the strongest singles of the 90's, and of all time! This 'corruption' leads into a 'Microsoft Sam'-like Voice in 'Fitter Happier', a computer-narrated poem about life as a human and normal things, but in ways really seems quite dark. It is the bit in the album you just can't miss. Next up, 'Electioneering' a bouncy, Smiths-like song with some very big messages underneath, and yes this is rocking. It is mental, and that's one of the ways I like it!\n\nBut next...is a turning point. This album seems to have gone through talking scenes of society, life, people, struggle, depression and accidents, but the next song you will experience is 'Climbing Up The Walls', which is fucking terrifying. It is such an awesome song, but I wouldn't listen to it at 2 am in the morning for fucks sake. The 'toys in the basement' line is just very creepy and unnerving, I like this song a lot for its unsettling atmopshere. And the screams at the end: this may be the scariest RH song, PERIOD!\n\nThe somewhat nightmare song of the album is followed by a daydream and once again another heart-string puller: 'No Surprises'. Another instantly loveable track and a fan-favourite, this song sticks out in its pure relatable-ness and its emotion. Yorke is basically pretending he is saying his 'last goodbyes' here and it is really touching. A piece of art. Followed closely by 'Lucky', another song about a crash, this time an 'air-crash', the album begins to decend into its final moments. The final moment comes in the form of...\n\nTHE TOURIST.This song is so unbelievably hopeful and gorgeous in its very soothing instrumentation and powerful climax. Happiness is the key to actually enjoy any part of this song. Whilst I'd say it's most certainly the happiest song on OK Computer, it's also the second strongest after 'Paranoid Android' and along with it, one of my favourite and instantly relatable songs of all time, EVER.\n\nIf you haven't heard this album yet, go hear it now. It's choice, and it will be a fantastic one you will make to do it.\n\n5/5\n\n*ding*""]",5.00 stars
JainaEgo,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'This is where Radiohead really started to experiment. It is also the peak of Radiohead, but this is no insult to the other albums - ""In Rainbows"", ""The Bends"", and even ""Hail to the Thief"" are all insanely good albums, even if they each have one or two flaws. OK Computer, on the other hand, is practically flawless. Now, I find ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" to be a little weak and I\'m not a fan of ""Fitter Happier"", but even that talking piece fits perfectly within the album. There are often transitions between songs and they are very, very effective.\n\nMy one true critique is that ""Lucky"" is the ultimate album closer. Perhaps I am alone in thinking this, but the song may be the best Radiohead song in existence. Sure, it\'s not as gorgeous as Let Down"", as spectacular as ""Paranoid Android"", as gorgeous as ""Pyramid Song"", or as powerful as ""2 + 2 = 5"", but its essence is unavoidable. It\'s the kind of song that wakes hidden strength within. It\'s a motivator without being a pump-up song. It\'s an emotional safeguard that promises that things will be fantastic. ""The Tourist"", while an incredible song, is too much of a downer for ""Lucky"". I\'m not sure if they could just be flipped effectively but putting it somewhere else in the album would probably fix this.\n\nWhat makes OK Computer so good, exactly? Like The Bends, the humanity of Radiohead is firmly on display - but this time, it\'s distorted. There\'s an electronic distortion in the mirror, and our reflection seems a little lost in the chaos of life. The album moves. Sometimes it\'s a brilliant shimmering light. Sometimes it\'s the madness that lurks within. Sometimes it\'s the fears that twist the things around us. There isn\'t a resolution - not exactly. Instead, there\'s a catharsis of sorts, as the music flows through your brain.\n\nOK Computer has the unfortunate effect of making other incredible albums seem bad. Radiohead has never matched it and probably never will, but that\'s okay. We only truly need one OK Computer, and we have it.', '']",5.00 stars

The tracks were sometimes experimental at the time this was realeased. It had a smart and cohesive theme that talked about the society that the band lived in. There were more emotions on this album abd it was more sad. I loved it. This had never been done before. It changed the band.

This band is SO smart and creative. It contains songs that will forever stay in my mind. But it isnt perfect. It could be. It is so close to being perfect. But some songs have small parts that can annoy me or just be boring sometimes, like The Toutist and Let Down. But the little bit thats bad is always erased by wonderful songs such as Paranoid Android, Exit Music (For A Film), Climbing Up The Walls and Lucky. The lyrics contain more metaphors and more interesting stories than ever before.

JanFreidun,"[""The Heavy/Noisy build up on some of the opening tracks of this album may very well be an acquired taste not quite unlike Oasis Be Here Now also released 1997. The slick guitar bends and grooves on represented by Electioneering and the refined jangle on No Surprises and Let Down show where bands like the Coral and The Stands took their queues from listen to Bill McCai and Nearer Than Green for instance. You heard me right! forget what professional reviewers has to say about those Beatle chaps, it was Radiohead all along, their refined rhythm and rich texture are realisations of ideas Crosby and Mcguinn was aiming for on Fifth Dimension 1966, but never quite achieved. On OK Computer Radiohead are really bringing it all home. It is brilliant, they take on all kinds of influences and still deliever a full fledged sound.\nRadiohead's OK Computer is layered in production and not as easy listening as say Pablo Honey and it may sound strange that the peculiar short little sound collage Fitter Happier, that features only synthesised vocals is in fact a creative high point of the album, and with OK Computer creativty and sincerity of purpose is what you have in abundance yes, you heard me and I am 100% serious. it is all in the atmosphere and pathos I know you are still thinking of those sharp edges, but put plainly they are a bit of the whole package and once you are into it you would not want to trade it for the whole world.

Dtruth333,"['OK Computer is a triumphant musical achievement by Radiohead. Their third album, a work consisting of a core of very solid ""alt-rock"" steeped in art and experimentation, is without a doubt one of the greatest albums ever made. Radiohead\'s discography has other albums I would consider flawless. It may not evoke the sheer wonder that Kid A does, or be as oddly comforting and transcendent as In Rainbows, but in terms of emotional impact, catharsis, and depth, OK Computer takes the cake. Each track perfectly fits the album (even Fitter Happier), and very few other albums are able to fit this claim. This album defines the turn of the millennium.\n\nThe opening track, Airbag, sets the stage beautifully. Radiohead has a way of making the first notes of their albums some of the most memorable, and here is a prime example. Lyrically, Thom Yorke sets up a beginning, a rebirth. The bass motif, the jangle of the guitars, the slightly distorted drums, and the sporadic noise bursts all set the tone for the album. They expertly transition into Paranoid Android, a six-and-a-half minute progressive epic, a hallucination of grandeur comprising of several sections each with different tones, tempos, and time signatures while remaining cohesive. This track shows a character both fearful and angry, anticipating conspiracy and lashing out against perceived threats. The fact that a band can put such a sprawling song together in such a seamless way is nothing short of spectacular. The third track, Subterranean Homesick Alien, again returns with fear. A new character, a marooned alien, pines for his home after spending time on Earth. Here, a theme of escapism becomes apparent. The spacious effects on the guitars are tasteful and frankly impressive.\n\nSide B begins with Exit Music (For A Film), starting with a few sparsely strummed chords, filled with despair. Tension builds as instruments are added. The climax of the song sees the bass go wild, the drums kick in, and a choir to back up Thom in a simply heart shattering manner. Escape is in sight. The songs fades back out to just the sparse guitar strumming, Thom, and the choir. Enter Let Down, one of the most beautiful, transcendent songs in existence. As Thom aspires to grow wings, he acknowledges that this is impossible, and that he will only be ""crushed like a bug."" The layered harmonies at the climax of the song are like the sound of redemption itself. Karma Police, a great song about paranoia and a dire future follows. It is and instantly recognizable chord progression. Then Fitter Happier. This interlude is often the butt of jokes, but I truly believe it ties the album together. It describes what would be a logical ideal human, but the voice reminds us that flaws are human.\n\nSide C kicks off with Electioneering, a song that describes corruption and the control of the world alongside a fiery jam of a song. Climbing Up the Walls, another personal favorite, describes insanity, paranoia, and a mind devouring itself. The outro features one of the most unique uses of strings in pop music, heavily inspired by Krzysztof Penderecki, and leaves the auditory equivalent of a smoldering bed of hot coal in its wake. No Surprises, the most beautiful and melodic song ever written about suicide follows. The narrator commits suicide with carbon monoxide poisoning and dies in a fit of euphoria reflected in the tone of the song. Lucky and The Tourist close out the album as side D, which is a triumph in art.\n\nAny person who has been driven to consider suicide will be especially effected by the Kafkaesque world of the album, but will be inspired by the music itself to live, if only to attempt to create some piece of art even approaching this album in quality. The world is often drab, dull, depressing, and spiteful, but if we manage to escape the cycle of self imprisonment somehow, we will find out ""pretty house"" and ""pretty garden.""

As a sad guy myself i never really felt a whole day turned off, in certain moments a will of burn the world and an anger for everyone starts to boil in my veins, and then, like always, i return to calm down in loneliness. I think Yorke misses this thing, he's always sad and hazy, unlike the sudden rage of a Kurt Cobain, just to say. Ironically the only lyrics I really loved are the wonderful critiques to society contained in Fitter Happier, the non-song of the album. I don't love this album for his sound, for his choking of great melodies and sensations in a sea of cold water, it's really something that I don't get, maybe, again, it's me.

Calling this album the best of the \'90s is perfectly reasonable. Calling this album the best of all time is embarrassing.""\n\n2) If you accept the above statement, you may stop reading this review now. If not, carry on.\n\n3) This album\'s status is understandable, if not deserved. It\'s the culmination of numerous rock, electronic and jazz influences throughout the sixties, seventies, and eighties coming together to form a seamless whole that is at once innovative and respectful of its source material. I cannot think of a better middle ground between the worlds of Eno, Floyd, the Beatles, and Miles Davis. Despite this, it\'s not even remotely derivative and manages to bring all sorts of neat touches to these ideas that make it feel brand new. The cello in Airbag, playing in tandem with the electric guitar, and the way the sleigh bells in the background immediately invoke winter and set the tone for the rest of the album, just for one example.\n\n4) The fact of the matter is that despite how good the album is, and how talented the group is, Radiohead fanboys are really something, huh? I can\'t imagine how many of us here must have been initially turned away from Radiohead by all their sniveling, worshipful cronies. Not saying every fan is a fanboy, but seriously, if you do that shit, just know that you\'re probably ruining the band for someone. (Jerk.) But that\'s nothing to do with the music, is it?\n\n5) The music is great. Front to back, stellar, no question. Absolutely stunning. Lyrics are great too. Production is lush and both claustrophobic and panoramic at once. Bleep, bloops, guitars, bass, keyboards, etc.\n\nWhat do you even say about this album? Overanalyzed is what this is; there\'s nothing left to pick over and dissect. And why would you want to, anyways?\n\nIt\'s real, real good. Really great. Top 10 best albums? Yep. But not the best. All the artists I mentioned before have at least one album I\'d put above this one on a top 10. Even so, it\'s really special, isn\'t it?\n\nLast thought: The Tourist is incredible. People who say it\'s a weak closer probably think Paranoid Android is the highlight of the whole album. It\'s exactly the kind of catharsis the album needs to slow down and end on a gorgeous, moving piece that ties everything neat up like a bow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso that ding doesn\'t mean shit.

ozzystylez,"['""Why are we listening to this fucking depressing music?!?"" I shouted, exasperated and upset, hitting the stop button on my stereo with dramatic force. Susan couldn\'t answer the question, just like she couldn\'t unbreak my heart or continue to love me. I was 17. She was 17, and she was my first love. We were in my bedroom in my parent\'s home one afternoon after school. The sun was beginning its descent and in the street outside other kids were enjoying the summer evening. I wasn\'t, I was breaking up with my first girlfriend for the most impossible of reasons; things weren\'t working out, we had grown apart. There was no resolving it.\n\nOK Computer played in the background and in an effort to make a dramatic demonstration of my sadness I had a little outburst of fury and silenced it at the climax of ""Exit Music"", imitating some kind of hate towards it. I was oblivious, at that moment, to the notion that it was in fact my friend, and throughout the remainder of that evening, and for many weeks and years afterwards, it was the only thing that made sense in a world of hormones and emotions that didn\'t.\n\nIt is ever-present throughout a mixture of strange memories from my teenage years. For a few months following our break-up, Susan and I continued to see each other, convincing ourselves that friendship was still possible. But often we would still yearn for each other, or at least I would for her, and she would oblige with diminishing enthusiasm until one very sorry day she wanked me off disinterestedly on my futon with all of her clothes still on as if she was doing a favour to a dying man. We stopped seeing each other soon after that. Disappointment and uncertainty crept into my consciousness with regularity and I yearned for the melancholic familiarity that OK Computer offered.\n\nMy Dad dismissed the album as depressing music and I agreed, but, thinking that I was depressed rather than just a normal hormonal teenager, I liked it even more for that. Its world-view and outlook for the world outside seemed bleak and I liked that, because at that uncertain time, that is how the future seemed to me; scary, unmanageable and bleak.\n\nPerhaps time and experience taught me differently, and perhaps reshaped my opinion not only of OK Computer, but of life also. The moment in the final verse of ""Let Down"" where the two intertwining vocal parts collide and swirl into a final chorus is so unbelievably beautiful, so elating, that it has brought me to tears of both happiness and of regret. Thom\'s resolution for the tragic dilemma of Romeo and his Juliet at the climax of ""Exit Music"" is so incredibly impassioned that it ripples my flesh. Paranoid Android\'s irregular rhythm explodes away into such harmonious beauty for the middle section of that song that it feels as though the powers that govern our world will one day fall at the mercy of art and truth. ""Electioneering"" rocks so hard that I feel as though I could drive my car through a wall and come out unscathed.\n\nAll of these little moments (and more), of triumph, of undeniable beauty and truth, have revealed themselves to me over the course of my life; a life no better or no worse than anybody\'s; as confusing, as meaningless and as profound as the next man\'s. OK Computer is my album. I was too young to claim ownership of Nevermind. More so than any other record, this album belonged to me. It grew with me as I grew with it, it was a constant source of comfort and discovery for me and continues to give me strength to this day.\n\nSo why were we listening to ""this fucking depressing music"" whilst we broke up? Why did this album soundtrack the end of my first love, the first taste of the bitter disappointment that life and love can bring?\n\nBecause nothing else could have done. Nothing else was as omnipresent nor as conciliatory nor as understanding. To a man who was already besotted with music this was an inevitable ever present that would get him through the next few weeks and months. Nothing ever remains the same, and that can be said of OK Computer; but like a mother, it has always remained sturdy and unconditional in its relationship with me. It has revealed new secrets as I have grown, but it has never let me down. And it will never leave me.']",5.00 stars
zaxapitsa,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Ok Computer is the best album of the 90s, the highest ranked on RYM. You might say that Radiohead fans are a bunch of insistent nerds, which we are, fair enough, but there\'s got to be more to it. The magical decade that started with the grunge explosion and the independent music opening to the world, that later welcomed noise rock and britpop, that still produces nostalgia even in some people who were barely born at the time, all of that was knocked down, demolished, finished with Ok Computer. Slowly but steadily it became undeniable than this level of sophisticated but accessible space rock made everything else pretty much obsolete. It was a flood. Radiohead\'s hype is still alive because of this. Kid A made them what they are, but nobody would have given a damn, or bothered to figure out their experiments, if they hadn\'t left us open-mouthed earlier. Indeed, there wouldn\'t be any need of Kid A. All the surprise, the scratching heads... none of that would have mattered at all. They had to change because they knew there was no way they could duplicate this. It was either that or becoming a rock puppet.\n\nOk Computer is their last epic album. Here they still have the energy, the ambition, the confidence, the rush to prove themselves of Pablo Honey and The Bends. Thom Yorke sings ""Idiot, slow down"" because they hadn\'t stopped yet, everything was going forwards as fast as they could. In fact, they were going so fast it seemed the decade went by faster for them than the rest of us. They brilliantly improved their ability to intertwine three guitars on The Bends, and established the possibilities of filling the sound with more and more guitar. Here they take it yet to another level, and start messing with more stuff and electronic toys, the famous Radiohead\'s ""layers"". At its best it reaches ethereal levels of sonic landscaping. It\'s the kind of music that makes me say pretentious shit like that, I can\'t help it. Still, it all has a classic band feeling. The material works just as good live, as they proved at Glastonbury. It took various listens for me to figure out what exactly they are playing to make it work.\n\nOk Computer was the first time they stepped away from what they had done before, too. Electioneering is the only track that would fit in their previous stuff. It could be another try to separate themselves from the Creep status. If it was, I\'d celebrate that annoying song sincerely. They finally succeeded and went from a copycat band to one that generates an awful lot of them. Lucky enough, the same ones that did this game changing album made another one shortly after and it was all over soon enough. Thanks to that the memory of Ok Computer is able to stay more or less intact, like some kind of summer romance. It\'s aging well, who knows if the next generations will keep listening to it as I listened to Dark Side Of The Moon? I don\'t really care. Good or bad, it has a well deserved place in pop rock history. I\'ve listened to this band more than any other, probably even more than Pink Floyd, and back in the day I listened to this album an unhealthy lot. Is it really that good?

I used to find Fitter Happier amusing, but it just irritates me now. Consumerism as a subject for serious social commentary is played out and this track brings nothing new or interesting to the table.\n\nThere are a few really good songs, though. If I believed in measuring albums by averaging how good all the songs are, I would rate it higher. But having one fantastic song and twelve mediocre songs doesn't make a good album. The good song is good independently.\n\nBut OK Computer's good songs: Let Down and No Surprises are wonderful ballads (the lyrics, I think are a little disappointing, for they eschew timeless, universal themes in favour of the overall album's eventually-to-be-dated commentary on the modern industrial world. But then again, if I want to listen to poetry, I'll buy a spoken-word album) and Electioneering is stomping, exhilarating bluesy number. Unlike the ballads, the lyrics are very fitting: it is an effective piece about the political situation and lends itself much better to universal application. But the music is the most important thing, and this song shows that Radiohead were capable of cutting the whinging and just rocking.\n\nIn short, OK Computer is not a good album, but it does have some very good songs, which do justify the album's existence.""]",2.00 stars

Kankato,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Radiohead found lightning in a bottle with the morose and ambivalent OK Computer. The band has managed to take the alienation of modern city life and condense its massive frustrations into an approachable but musically engaging alt rock album.\n\nThe setup is surprisingly conventional. The band is still using the three guitar approach from their last album while expanding their sound with tasteful electronics. The guitar work and solos are all around excellent, complimenting the album’s signature melancholy. The interesting points of departure come in Radiohead’s exceptional knack for melodies and Thom Yorke’s largely crooned vocalwork. He delivers on the album’s signature angst by soaring above and around the band’s playing. A lot of his vocals drive the emotional core of the project but I think its crowning jewel lies in the lyrics.\n\nThe lyrics are a series of jagged details colliding together into semi coherent laments. While this may sound like a complaint I think it’s one of the album’s best assets. The words make sense as pathos for a divided world where people are increasingly isolated from each other and the greatest issues in life are forces far beyond the control of any one person. The protagonists of OK Computer are incapable of functioning as basic humans and are entirely unable to fix themselves. These anxieties are general enough to empathize with an enormous amount of personal issues, providing theming general enough to apply to many but specific enough to never lose its weight.\n\nI think this dynamic is part of why OK Computer enjoys such unanimous acclaim while being surprisingly difficult to pin down. The arrangements give Thom Yorke’s poetry direction while Yorke’s lyrics contextualize the music’s incredible melodramas. They feed in and out of each other perfectly.\n\nThe only hesitation I have with OK Computer is its fluff. Exit Music and Electioneering don’t serve the album’s larger conceptual thesis or clash against the central tone, respectively. These songs could have been cut but I understand that studio politics kept them in the track list. They aren’t enormous blemishes but I’d rather listen to them as singles. I also understand that some find the presentation to be sterile compared to their later work. I can see how this album is tame compared to gut wrenchers like Hole in the Heart or their followup release Kid A, but I think that the approachability of alt rock was not only a sincere creative choice but the right one to make.\n\nIn an age where so many have lost control of their fate it makes sense this album would be the #1 album on RYM.', '']",3.50 stars
atawsif,"[""Ok Computer. Even before reading this review, or any other review for that matter, it's safe to say you, the reader, already have an opinion about this album and the band that created it. It's also safe to say anything said in this review will do very little to change your opinion of it. So you might be wondering why even bother writing about it? Well simple answer, Ok Computer for me, and a lot of other people, is an album that has to be talked about. Not only because it has grown to be one of the most influential rock records of all time, but also because it holds quite a special place in my heart. Cue the 'awwwwwwwwws.'\n\nIn terms of the music, there isn't a dull moment on this record. In its core, Ok Computer is a rock album. You have hardy guitar riffs and chord progression scattered throughout the track listing, However its ideas aren't just limited to the realm of rock'n'roll; there's a fair bit on experimentation here as well. There are a lot of unique textures that might escape your ears initially and that can partly be attributed to Radiohead's ingenious use of subtlety. Of course there are moments when the traditional rock elements step back and let the strangeness shine. For example on Subterranean Homesick Alien, you have a tremolo-powered organ playing an elusive chord progression, with Jonny Greenwood's effects-ridden guitar in the forefront creating a sound which literally brings aliens to mind. On paper it sounds like an overkill of effects, however those two elements actually achieve an almost-perfect harmony. And therein lies Ok Computer's greatest strength: its ability to meld together ideas that seem like they don't belong together. It's traditional, yet innovative. It breaks rules yet creates new rules altogether. It's paranoid about computers, yet contains liberal use of electronics. And perhaps it's those conflicting ideas that make it an unappealing album to some, and the greatest album ever to others.""]",5.00 stars

Most albums considered the best (and I agree) are usually from the 60s or 70s, but the 90s was still very experimental and innovative on its own terms. So for this album from 1997 is an interesting time, but the right time for this classic (yes, classic) to be released. Loveless and Nevermind are some of the best to say from the decade, but the album OK Computer stands entirely alone. It just could be the Citizen Kane of albums. Really an album too late or way beyond its years. It's a cold, blissful album, but that's what makes it such a breath of fresh air. Radiohead is one of those bands that everybody listens to and talks about all the time but you, maybe one of those things you just really got a hold on, like a TV show on a channel you don't have or a superhero movie you just don't care to see. But everyone knows OK Computer, and it's praised and respected for a reason. Everything is anything more that great. It's a true achievement in music. Why? It has great depth and meaning to it, without trying too hard. It makes me ask myself What the hell is point? especially on Exit Music (For a Film). Airbag is easily one of the best openers you could ask for, already delivering the album's anxious and lonely theme. It's got the popular songs Paranoid Android and Karma Police, but the songs that aren't meant to be singles, like Let Down or Electioneering, are still some of the best material from the group. It also signifys beauty, whether it's the great instrumentation on Subterranean Homesick Alien or the space rock on No Surprises.

Rock wasn\'t exactly a young genre in 1997, and this album was very effective in blending rock with modernity while still retaining the genre\'s core essence and not reinventing the wheel. The individual performances, composition, songwriting, and production are all outstanding and it\'s just an extremely well-crafted album in all facets. There is a lot of variety, climaxes and anti-climaxes, and changes in tone throughout all the different tracks, and although not every song is a masterpiece they all contribute effectively to the whole. ""Let Down"" is the greatest song Radiohead ever wrote and it\'s buildups and emotional impact resonates with me every time I listen. OK Computer\'s scope and ambition is part of what set it apart from the music of the time through its balance of progressive tendencies with the post-Britpop and grunge alt-rock style which often rejected that kind of approach.\n\nI\'m not one of those people who think that forward-thinking music is inherently superior to backward-looking music, but there\'s something really special about the way this album seems so much more modern than most of its contemporaries. A significant part of its legacy is its cultural relevance lyrically and thematically to a time period that is bringing about some of the most drastic changes to society inhuman history. It really does capture the zeitgeist of not only its time but the decades following through concepts like technology, sanity, alienation and political climate. It\'s obvious to say that this relevance won\'t be going away any time soon.\n\nAn essential album for the 21st century even though it was released in 1997.\n\n9.5/10']",4.50 stars
Conahugh,"['Prior to this record, Radiohead\'s discography was filled to the brim with a lot of the angsty alt rock sound that plagued most music tapping into the new brit pop scene. While I somewhat enjoyed Pablo Honey, despite the records unpolished production and juvenile lyricism, The Bends was an album that pushed this phase that was not only prevalent in their music at the time, but through out the entirety of the genre. Ok Computer, however, is an eloquintely arranged record that has the emotional finesse to establish a truly depressing and melancholy atmosphere, particularly through Thom Yorke\'s vocal delivery (see No Surprises and Paranoid Android as prime examples). The use of electronic music also complimented the mood that this album sets, which would be further developed on Kid A (my personal favourite Radiohead record). The only issue I have with this album is the song ""Karma Police"". While it is not a bad song, at all, the sonic impact did not have the same weight as the lyrics carried, in my opinion. The piano is particularly flat sounding in this song and kinda ""vanillarizes"" the music as whole, which is a disappointment as Yorke\'s voice in this song is at it\'s strongest. Despite that, this record is almost perfect and while most may have listen to ""Karma Police"" and ""Paranoid Android"" already, this is defineltely something worth listening too in it\'s full, about three times over, this an experience worth sitting through as many times as you physically can. 9/10']",4.00 stars

Apart from the brilliant article from The A.V. Club, my favorite was the Rolling Stone\'s interview with the band, where the members talked about their circumstances at the time that OK Computer was being recorded.\n\nWhat interested me was how OK Computer\'s themes of technological alienation were used by Thom Yorke to illustrate his anxiety with being on the road without rest for such a long time, and how intentional it was to express those feelings through that device. ""People get up too early to leave houses where they don\'t want to live, to drive to jobs where they don\'t want to be, in one of the most dangerous forms of transport on Earth."" he says. With this as a core theme of the album, the songs become a lot less mysterious, making articles like ""The Radiohead Prophesies: How OK Computer Predicted the Future"" even more laughable. We can take these songs at face value as a collection of Thom Yorke\'s experiences without needing a million thinkpieces to Fully Understand the Implications about the 21st Century that this album explores.\n\nOf course, the fact that I\'m sheepishly rejecting a Hidden Meaning in this way just reveals that I\'m embarrassed to admit that I did believe in the Deeper Message of OK Computer, and heck, maybe I still do. That\'s fine, though. You\'re free to interpret art however you want, it\'d be pretty boring otherwise. And I do think that this album is worth all the hype and obsession and dissection. Twenty years down the line, it has a certain legacy surrounding it. I consider it a cornerstone of modern music, and man, I just think it\'s a really swell album, with a lot of interesting sounds, great and essential melodies, and subject matter that resonated with a lot of people, and still does.

No Surprises (for example) is a great song! I love it! But it doesn't completely floor me. It's not supposed to. In fact, No Surprises is all the better for its subtlety, and it gains incredible potency in the context of the album as a whole.\n\nRather, OK Computer, taken as a whole, is so cutting and so powerful that it seems to practically embody the isolation and angst of living in the 21st century. There will not another album quite like this. It was at the perfect time and place, doing something that hasn't come before and can't be recreated.\n\nFor these reasons, OK Computer is profoundly moving to listen to. Each track hits hard and forces the listener to reflect on their space, their lives, and their relationships. There is despair, alienation, disgust, fear, regret, and relief captured here, all bottled perfectly and presented to you in a 53:21 runtime.\n\nIf I have one minor complaint, it's with Electioneering. The issue isn't with the quality of the song - it's stellar - but rather with its placement on the record. Between Fitter Happier and Climbing Up the Walls, it's an odd burst of straightforward guitar rock that seems at odds with the chilling atmosphere of the songs around it.

The songs are mostly memorable, intense and ever-evolving pieces of fine and soft Alternative Rock. And, as a huge Manson fan, I dig those Industrial parts ('Fitter Happier').\nBut despite all these great things, I don't think this deserves to be called the greatest album of all-time by any definition.\nFirst of all, it all fells losely connected and sometimes kind of messy or bloated, even within songs the constant changes can feel unnecessary or random, which putted me off sometimes. So, while these songs are definetely gripping, they also pass by quickly without leaving a huge mark, due to the sometimes confusing nature of them.\nSecondly, while this album is constantly great, it also features 'weaker' songs ('Electioneering', 'Climbing Up the Walls'), that aren't nearly as great as the huge highlights ('Paranoid Android', 'Karma Police', 'No Suprises').\nAnd thirdly and most importantly, I don't see much value in these songs besides mostly great background music. Don't understand me wrong, it is an art itself to create awesome background music, but this is far from my first choice, when I want to listen to music without paying much attention.

""Black Star"", ""High and Dry"", ""Iron Lung"", ""The Bends"", were all songs I liked before falling in love with this album.\n\nThen Kid A caught on with me like a storm, because I think KID A as a whole is more rewarding to sit through in it\'s entirety than OK Computer. I can\'t imagine listening to ""Morning Bell"" without listening to ""Idioteque"" first. The tracks on Kid A just sort of bleed into each other and that makes that album more rewarding.\n\nHowever, I could pick any song from OK Computer and listen to it at any time. They all work out of Context, like singles. Murmur and Hatful of Hollow have always been essential albums to me, the guitars here have that same magic to them. We also have the electronic stuff on top of that, that pushes that same familiar sound to a completely different level. If that wasn\'t enough already, we have Thom Yorke\'s vocals, which are very different from ""The Bends"" and pretty much any other popular band from the time. I think well written lyrics can add a lot to an album, but vocal melodies are more essential in the long run, when you will eventually get tired of the lyrics.\n\nI can\'t really pick a favorite song, but ""Electioneering"" is a song I skip more than others. When I\'m in the mood for music, ""Let Down"" really connects with me emotionally without resorting to sappy cliches, and that is quite a feat if you ask me. When ""Let Down"" picks things up in the latter half, it turns into pure bliss in audio form, The ""I am going to grow wings"" part just overloads my senses every time. Live versions from years gone by are even better than the studio version, in my opinion. Heck, I think most songs here have at least one live performance which are superior to them.

Maybe they liked the challenge.\n\nAnyway, this is a review I have tried many times to write, but not many of them have been anything other than drafts. I don’t feel as strongly about this album any more, so I’m hoping that reviewing it will be easier this time.\n\nFirst of all, Radiohead is an overrated band because of how consistently their albums are good (or better) – all of their music (except, perhaps for The King of Limbs) is at quite a high standard and thus, people revere them. In my opinion (as someone who isn’t especially partial to In Rainbows or The Bends and someone who is bound to be disagreed with), the problem is that only a couple of their albums are downright brilliant like everyone seems to think – OK Computer is just barely one of them; among their best records and a record that contains four of their best songs:\n\n“Subterranean Homesick Alien” is probably up there in their top three – I’d also include “House of Cards” and “Morning Bell” – what can I say, Philip Selway is my favourite member of the band – throughout the second half of the band’s discography, he has delivered some of the best percussion of the 2000s (“House of Cards” features the prettiest drumming I’ve heard since Ringo on “In My Life”). That said, it’s only recently that I have come around to his work here. Admittedly, he would reach his peak on Kid A, but I’m still a sucker for some of his work on OK Computer, “Subterranean Homesick Alien” being no exception – it’s not the most unique bit of percussion in the world, but the weird revolving feeling it has is really a clever feat of production. Thom Yorke’s vocals are beautiful here, as are his lyrics: “I wish that they’d swoop down in a country lane/Late at night when I’m driving/Take me on board their beautiful ship/Show me the world as I’d love to see it/I’d tell all my friends/But they’d never believe me/They’d think that I’d finally lost it completely” – the way he sings “lost it completely” is more telling than the line itself.\n\n“Let Down” is one of the most heartbreaking songs I can think of. Its riff, despite not being the most technically proficient guitar work on the album, is absolutely beautiful, but the song mainly exists for its vocals, which get sublime in the last third of the song, wherein Yorke throws some falsetto over the top of the aesthetic the song had maintained until that moment. Lyrically, it’s devastating (as the title would suggest): “The emptiest of feelings/Disappointed people clinging on to bottles”, “One day, I am going to grow wings/A chemical reaction/Hysterical and useless”.\n\n“No Surprises” is also quite the heartbreaker – it is home to the album’s best bassline and a great melody. Its best moment is the intensity of Yorke’s singing: “Such a pretty house and such a pretty garden”.\n\n“The Tourist” is an underrated track, which to me captures the split second between a car accident having happened and you realizing it’s happened. As such, it’s a rather dreamy song, but with an edge of the panic that one feels as something bad is inevitably happening soon. The fills Selway does are brilliant. The song is also home to the most conventional guitar tones on the album, which would fit well in the discography of an early 70s hard rock singles band. Don’t get me wrong though: Greenwood’s guitarwork is great, probably at its best on the album.\n\nOn the other hand though, my favourite thing about this record is how clever and well thought out all the tones of all the instruments are here. It’s not an experimental rock album, but the band really took things into their own hands as far as the sounds of the guitars and keyboards, which are varied, unpredictable and key to the identity of each song. The production is brilliant in other respects too, like the occasional creepy additions of background noise that you’ll hear in “Fitter Happier” and “Exit Music (For a Film)”.\n\nThe thing about using unusual tones is that it is bound to be divisive. In the case of OK Computer, most people seem to have fallen head over heels with the sound palette, but I find that half the time, the guitars come off as sounding slightly bland, even though the songwriting and playing is always great.\n\nPut it this way: it’s a hard album to deny the brilliance of. I’d go as far as saying that no album has captured the inherent coldness and isolation of the modern world nearly as well as this one (it even does the job better than Radiohead’s followup Kid A, an album I prefer). But I still fill comfortable deferring to LimedIBagels: “Calling this album the best of 1997 is accurate [although Modest Mouse’s offering that year is a definite contender]. Calling this album the best of the ’90s is perfectly reasonable. Calling this album the best of all time is embarrassing.”\n\n“Scrolling up and down/I am born again.”', 'https://enjambin.wordpress\n.com/2015/06/05/ok-computer-radiohea\nd-studio-album/', 'https://enjambin.wordpress', '.com/2015/06/05/ok-computer-radiohea']",3.00 stars
AirlineFood,"['This is the number one album on the website. I thought it changed my life in middle school when I first heard it, but all the same it\'s a little disappointing it\'s number one. Disappointment and pride mixed up together? Shame? Joy? I\'ll have each song reviewed after this, but first I want to talk about the album as a whole.\n\nMaybe I grew out of it or listened to it too many times, but it doesn\'t hit as hard as it used to. I think it\'s because to have this as your favorite album, you have to take yourself incredibly seriously. To listen to this work, which is objectively awesome, is good. But music has a personal element. And I feel like the fact that it\'s number one is sad, because personally applying this to your life and missing it as a story and character piece is like looking at a Pollock and saying ""wow I like this painting, sometimes when I\'m mad I throw things at walls"". I\'ve read the OK Computer reviews. People are so rabidly invested, they\'re ruining it. We need to have a communal consensus that this album is about Thom Yorke and robots, and quit sullying it by putting things on it and placing it on a pedestal. Everybody\'s taking themselves way too seriously. It\'s like listening to whale songs and assuming they\'re trying to speak to you, Richard Summers from Conneticut. It\'s a whale. Or like how every alien in movies looks humanoid. Radiohead distances itself from us. With active contempt. Why can\'t we do the same, out of love?\n\n1. Airbag- The only usage of sleighbells I\'ve liked in a song made past 1955. It\'s not my favorite song on the album but it does a great job of establishing the mood and concept without betraying the emotional buildup that occurs later. It\'s fairly static though, the only changed happening subtly in the background in a way that\'s well calculated and clean.\n- 4 Stars\n\n2. Paranoid Android- I really love the transition in the beginning of this song, opening lyrics included. It finds a way of making words that would be hilariously dramatic to read in a teenager\'s notebook taken seriously, by combining them with just the right amount of minutely cerebral details to the lyrics. It also finds a way to build the mood up while actually building it down, and then immediately follows that with a build down that builds down.\n- 4 Stars\n\n3. Subterranean Homesick Alien- I love the guitars on this song so much I can\'t stand it. However, the lyrics are so relatable to teenagers that it kills me a little. I feel like it\'s a great character song, though. I mean when I was in middle school I went around thinking that I could show people the stars and the meaning of life and they\'d shove me away, but that was really missing the beauty that is the perspective of the song.\n- 4 Stars\n\n4. Exit Music (For a Film)- This would make pretty good exit music. It would be losing its integrity and irony of self awareness if it were, though. This is also one of the only times when I\'ve liked that choir-like effect in the back. Radiohead is just so sincere and deliberate about being insincere and cold, that I have to enjoy these sorts of things. Plus the peak of this song is brilliant. And you can tell it knows.\n- 4 Stars\n\n5. Let Down- This song is half optimistic in a suburban sort of way. I like how this song seems to take itself a little less seriously than the others, or maybe that\'s just the character again.\n- 4 Stars\n\n6. Karma Police- This was my favorite song for years. It sounds fascist but good fascist. I don\'t think I can review it without being biased towards my early pubescent self.\n- 5 Stars\n\n7. Fitter Happier- This is one of those songs that could be a poem too, but it\'s a better song. Anyways, on the first few listens it hit super deep emotionally. It\'s one of those things that people who hate mundane things love, because let\'s face it, a good portion of it is just listing what people think about growing up if they don\'t want to. So it has a very specific audience. But I fit that audience back when this album was my thing.\n- 4 stars\n\n8. Electioneering- This song rocks a bit harder than the others, less cerebral and more quick. It\'s more electric I guess. That doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t fit into the story. It does. It just also applies outside the story in a more than personal way, so realistically he\'s a bit angry.\n- 5 Stars\n\n9. Climbing Up the Walls- I like how the drum beat and the vocals don\'t match at all, and that seems to make them fit perfectly. Plus the production, including the statics and birdlike effects really make the song. It\'s steady but distant.\n- 5 Stars\n\n10. No Surprises- This song is a mix of cute and sad, two things that should never normally mix, but it works. I like to think that it could be exit music too, but to a different sort of film. You can hear them referencing the mundane again, playing to their target emotional sphere. But in character when it\'s second person, which is good.\n- 4 Stars\n\n11. Lucky- Lucky has more of an established chorus and growth than some others on the album. They\'re good, no doubt, but minimal is Radiohead\'s thing and I feel like basing a song in one swooping message doesn\'t suit them as well as the songs made out of a bunch of small details.\n- 4 Stars\n\n12. The Tourist- This song has a bunch of neat double meanings, but I personally don\'t find it as enjoyable as some others where tension was higher. It\'s slow but without the fizzyness or depth of emotion. It\'s emotional, it\'s Radiohead, but it holds cerebral a little too high in balance. This serves its purpose of a closer, but not so much as an independent song.\n- 4 Stars']",4.50 stars

HeyAnonAccount,"[""My first encounter with Radiohead was sometime when I was taking my first baby steps into the world of music, new to the exciting Spotify program and constantly browsing around for new good songs to listen to. I came across Creep which seems to be their most well-known song for some incredibly odd reason and I also came across Karma Police which I enjoyed a bit more. However at the time I wasn't a huge fan of Radiohead and for years to come I'd still find their music to be incredibly overhyped by the general population. I still to this day don't find much interesting about the band. Maybe this is from my days as a hardcore Muse-fan, maybe it's from having outgrown brittish alt-rock by the time I actually started listening to their records, or maybe their music just isn't for me.\n\nOK Computer exists as the bridging gap between the more accessible, mainstream Radiohead, the one behind the more popular singles (Creep, High And Dry) and despite being seen as quite ordinary, it still adventures a bit beyond the more straightforward rock music of the late 90's with electronic elements peeking in and out, hinting of the direction to come on Kid A, three years into the future, something especially notable during the ending segment of Airbag or the choir that comes in right in the middle of Exit Music (For A Film).\n\nHowever despite all these attempts I find it hard to find something to hold onto that isn't prevalent in most alt-rock bands from the same time and place. There's something about Radiohead's music from before Kid A that sounds so dumbed down and simplistic, where the only thing that really seperates Radiohead from your run of the mill late 90's rock band is Thom Yorke's poetic lyrics (a handshake of carbon monoxide), the unnecessary experimentation with tracks like Fitter Happier and the raw emotion that seeps through on a couple of tracks here and there (namely Let Down and No Surprises on this record).\n\nIt took me years to go from not being a fan at all to being able to atleast somewhat appreciate OK Computer on a personal level and I doubt I'll ever be able to love it or Radiohead as much as some people think they deserve. For me, Radiohead is the band that will be our generation's Pink Floyd, the modern kind of dad-rock; albums that kids will come across through parents who never ventured outside of the swamps of NME's favorite bands.\n\nBut honestly, don't mind my ridiculously grumpy opinions. If you haven't already heard this album, there's a great chance that you might love every second of it and it's honestly worth the fifty minutes it takes to go from Airbag to The Tourist so if you find yourself on a long commute to work or traveling somewhere far this summer, then bring this one and a pair of earbuds for the journey.\n\nOk Computer\nRadiohead\n6.5/10""]",3.00 stars

Il resto è un buon tappeto musicale, per carità, può servire da comodo sottofondo musicale se si sta studiando o leggendo, ma un ottimo album è tutta un\'altra cosa.

I don’t think I’ve seen so much praise and acclaim in the aesthetic albums even in its opening day since Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band and/or Dark Side of the Moon. Regardless Radiohead are one of my front-runners, while I don’t think OK Computer is perfect, it’s still pretty damn good.\nI might as well get through what I disfavour. This is one of the first albums I’ve heard in my life, and with all the hype; I wasn’t disappointed, but I expected a little more. Most of the album is while grand, their melodies are mellow, but the first few songs trick you into believing there’s some strident, “Electioneering”, one of the other latter sorted in with the mellow music is one of the nadir tracks (excluding the speech synthesis on “Fitter Happier”), but the composing still feels sturdy and very metaphorical; while debatably progressive, if they went that farther, they’d probably be in the same position as Muse. Another is Thom Yorke’s vocals, (I mentally hearing booing from a crowd), but let me first acknowledgement, is original; the falsetto singing he produces has a lot of depth (“what’s thaaaaatttt”, “what’s thaaaaatt”) while giving a boy band pop voice vibe can appeal to everyone, but continuing to hear it in an entirety album loses momentum and psyche, maybe intentional since it’s so estranged.\nBut as debasing as some extents the vocals are, lyrically this is the most cognitive material used of mental health since Pink Floyd; also the more homogenous they are together, how they both provide hidden symbolism on background instruments that mix in well with the authentic and mechanical pieces, (my favourite essence is the buildup in the background vocals used in the second versus’ of “Exit Music (For A Film)"" and “Lucky”) as well as using their art for escapism but giving the awareness of surrealist depression and anxiety. The ideal album for the emotionally fragile.\nThis is Radiohead’s first concept album, and reassessing the strident tone of the album, there was no way in hell that they would revert to their original heavy rock and roll sound, and not many famous alternative rock bands in the 90\'s at the time were deriving that deep music-wise. I’m not sure why even Yorke didn’t want his work with the band to be classified as art, but he must’ve re-considered.\nWith that said, OK Computer is intelligently crafted, intelligently melodic, and a culturally significant work of art for OUR generation.\n\nHighlights: “Paranoid Android,” “Exit Music (For A Film)”']",4.50 stars
PhallaxorTheMusicLord,"['Okay, I know there is not much I can say about this album that hasn\'t already been said. However, all of the ""Radiohead is God"" bullshit aside, I don\'t care how high the rating on this site is. This is, in my opinion, Radiohead\'s best record. It also happens to be one of my favorite records of all time, and I am glad it is not my first review. I personally believe that this album has more variety than any other Radiohead record. I will talk about this track by track.\n\n""Airbag"" kicks the album off on a dark and thought-provoking note. The slow abrasive guitar strumming continues before it evens out and Thom comes in with lyrics about dying in a car crash and then coming back to life. The song perfectly balances a dark topic with a beautiful melody.\n\n""Paranoid Android"" was a ballsy choice for the first single. 6 minute songs with odd structures and no explosive catch chorus are rarely radio hits. (I said ""rarely"" not ""ever"") But the song was still popular anyway. The song begins as hauntingly as it ends. It starts with Thom begging for peace and ends with him beautifully singing ""God loves his children. God loves his children."" How seriously Yorke meant this is unclear but it leads into the final heavy guitar riff and end of the song. Over all it feels more like several songs spliced together.\n\n""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" is where the instrumentation take the front seat for me. The opening chords and guitar work are a testament to the musicianship of Jonny Greenwood. His ideas are so unique that someone could tell me that the guitar was actually a synthesizer and I would buy it at least a little.\n\nConceptually based on Romeo & Juliet the song ""Exit Music"" has one of the most explosive moment on the album. The first half of the song is played by acoustic guitar with lyrics about Romeo and Juliet planning to run away together. It then explodes just at the boiling point of the story. ""We all hope you choke."" Chilling as fuck.\n\nI have to say ""Let Down"" is one of my favorite songs, not just on the album, but ever. It is Yorke\'s sharpest song-writing, as he talks about distant and well ""Let Down."" He speaks of one day growing wings and being hysterical. The instrumentation on this song is dazzling as well. If you listen to the layers you can see why it is such a difficult song to perform live and why has seemed to vanish from Radiohead\'s live sets. The melodic, floating guitar chords are give me pure eargasms.\n\n""Karma Police"" opens up with a chilled out acoustic riff and piano. This continues for the first half of the song as Thom sings about annoyance and frustration. A short fast drum solo creates a transition into the chorus and Thom comes back in with his feathery, falsetto vocals and sings about losing himself.\n\nDespite its lack of Thom Yorke\'s singing and its strange robotic voice, I like ""Fitter Happier."" It is a short track with a nice change of pace. It is both funny and creepy.\n\n""Electioneering"" is by far the heaviest track on the album and seems like it would be a fun song to see live. Johnny Greenwood really when in a ""Just fucking rock"" direction with it. He then brings in some some raw, buzzing guitar work over the rest of the song. The drumming on this song is also catchy a hell. Props to Phil.\n\nAnd then there was ""Climbing Up the Walls."" This song has an awesome and paranoid chorus. Thom starts singing about someone\'s skull opening up and climbing up the walls. The vocals are so passionate and the song ends with Thom letting lose a head-splitting scream. I love the production choice on this song too. The raw recording and reverby work is trippy.\n\nThe album takes a quick, sharp turn with ""No Surprises."" The intrumentation resembles a lullaby. The lyrics talk about wanting a quite life free of surprises. It is so beautiful that it almost brings tear to my eye.\n\n""Lucky"" and ""The Tourist"" are the perfect pair to close off this masterpiece. ""Lucky"" has Yorke taking a deeper tone before his voice rises up and he displays his fantastic vibrato. The slow soaring guitar creates a great layer over the chorus. The song ends somewhat abruptly and leads into ""The Tourist"" which closes the album with another masterful vocal performance as Thom digs into the higher parts of his range to simply say ""...slow down.""\nThe melody is slow and has so many nice twists and sharp turns in the tempo.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this album is one of the best albums ever made. Definitely top 10 for me. It was the first Radiohead album I ever listened to and had a huge impact on my musical taste.']",5.00 stars

I told Father Admin to slow down, but the brakes were frozen. It was hopeless. I closed my eyes and hoped that when I opened them again, I would be alive. And luckily, I was. I'm amazed that I survived. The next thing I remembered was waking up in the hospital, the machines beeping ever so steadily. That's when the Medication started. Every child has to start it when they become a teenager. Yet even though I was physically alive, emotionally I felt that from that moment on I would be better off dead. Months turn to years, and my emotional numbness began to become normal. I started to fit in with the machines, as much as I hated to. Dropping out didn't make matters much better, as much as I thought it would.\n\nSummer arrives. I'm 19 now. I decided to sneak up on the roof one night and go stargazing with my little brother, fantasizing about other worlds beyond our own. He asks if we could play hide and seek in the woods just like old times, since our Admins were sleeping. I agree, and we jump off the roof and run into the forest together. It seemed like we laughed and ran around the woods that night forever. That was the last night I would see my brother again. The next day, after waking from my sleep, I began packing my bags. I looked back once more at the place I grew up in, and started walking.\n\nBut walking turned to running. I stopped at a small coffee shop on my way back. Something about it seemed welcoming to me, almost innocent. The soft music, relaxing atmosphere, pleasant design, happiness. Like a utopia separate from the rest of my cold world. I take a sip of coffee and start talking to a young girl there, breathtakingly beautiful. I was surprised to find a human there. Her name was Belle. She was a time traveler from Earth, and said she could tell I was different. She held her hand out to me. Just from her touch, the medication I'd been forced to take for half of my life begins to wear off. And once it does, I begin to feel again. I was no longer numb. The sunlight warmed my heart again, and a simple smile made me smile again too. I'd become human once more. I was free. The darkness and bleak memories come back to me, but so does the light.\n\nBecause maybe that's what makes us different from the machines.

floristjenkins,"['Going into this review, I was already semi-familiar with OK Computer. Having been a longtime fan of “indie” music (though I’m hesitant to use the term indie, because it covers such a broad range of music nowadays), it was difficult to discuss music without Radiohead coming up – and, of course, OK Computer.\n\nMy first listen of OK Computer some two or three years left me feeling pretty unimpressed. The instrumentation only really held my interest on a handful of tracks, and the same goes for the lyrics.\n\nBefore I go much further, though, let me warn you: my opinion of this album hasn’t changed all that much.\n\nThe first three tracks on the album – “Airbag,” “Paranoid Android,” and “Subterranean Homesick Alien” – are songs that fall into a category of music that I call “decent enough.” Nothing in those three songs jump out at me. The lyrics keep me at a consistent level of disinterest, and the instrumentation is just good enough to keep me listening, waiting for some sort of crescendo.\n\nFinally, that crescendo comes; “Exit Music (For A Film)” is one of my favorite songs off of OK Computer. Not only is the crescendo a little more than 3/4 of the way through incredible, but the lyrics actually give me goosebumps: “You can laugh / A spineless laugh / We hope your rules and wisdom choke you / Now we are one in everlasting peace.” Allow me to reiterate that I don’t think the lyrics in the songs preceding “Exit Music (For A Film)” were bad; they simply failed to jump out at me. This might have to do with the fact that the instrumentation failed to support the lyrics, because I won’t deny that the verse “In the next world war / In a jackknifed juggernaut / I am born again” from “Airbag” is bland; it just doesn’t sell itself in the song.\n\n“Let Down” is a bit of a letdown after “Exist Music (For A Film),” though I suppose it would be a bit repetitive to follow a great crescendo of a song with another intense crescendo of a song. Still, “Let Down” falls into that same category as the first three songs on the album: decent enough. However, there is one part of the song that does manage to jump out at me, and the lyrics in that section almost manage to give me goosebumps, too: “One day I’m going to grow wings / A chemical reaction / Hysterical and useless.”\n\n“Karma Police” is a catchy song, and its lyrics are pretty gripping, too. My favorite verse is “Karma police, arrest this girl / Her Hitler hairdo is / Making me feel ill / And we have crashed her party.” In fact, it is from the lyrics in “Karma Police” that I first began to draw my conclusions about the lyrical themes in the album.\n\nTo me, OK Computer is a collection of songs aimed at exposing and criticizing the ignorance and ridiculous vanity of much of humanity in 1997, and unfortunately the lyrics are still relevant now in 2014. There are also themes of conformity, which might fall under vanity.\n\n“Fitter Happier” is the best example of the themes of conformity found throughout the album, as the entire track is just a robotic voice reciting reasons as to why/how he is fitter and happier. Though this song borders on being laughable for how overwrought it is with metaphor, the lyrics manage to be intense enough that you have to take it seriously; it’s a powerful track.\n\nHowever, all of the tracks following “Fitter Happier” kind of blur together for me, with the only that stands out being “No Surprises.” It’s a catchy track with a sweet melody, and the chorus gets stuck in your head – but those are pretty much the only reasons why it stands out to me.\n\nUnfortunately, “Electioneering,” “Climbing Up The Walls,” “Lucky,” and “The Tourist” are all just decent enough. The instrumentation is consistently well executed, and the lyrics are undeniably poetic and powerful, but they just fail to sell themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, I don’t believe that a song has to literally sell itself to me with lavishly produced synths fit for the radio or anything, but I guess I just expected every aspect of OK Computer to be mind blowing. After all, it has quite the reputation; though it might be that reputation that caused my to set my expectations so high, and thus caused me to be, overall: disappointed.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nFavorite Tracks: Exit Music (For A Film), Karma Police, Fitter Happier, and No Surprises\n\n- Florist Jenkins', 'https://floristjenkins.wor\ndpress.com/2014/12/16/radiohe\nad-ok-computer/', 'https://floristjenkins.wor', 'dpress.com/2014/12/16/radiohe']",3.50 stars

After all, there\'s already a litany of far more interesting and compelling reviews of this album for you to read, many of which were written decades ago, many of which summed up an album that was groundbreaking for it\'s time but can\'t seem to outlive its own omnipresent shadow.\n\nTo sum up OK Computer the best way I know how:\nIt\'s absolutely not the best album of all time (despite what the RYM charts may say), though, to be perfectly fair, who the fuck am I (or any other person) to say what the G R E A T E S T album of all time is. I don\'t think you can objectively proclaim that such an objective point of contention actually exists.\n\nSecond point to make: this album gets a lot of love, but in receiving such a staggering amount of love and adoration, it has also likewise received a lot of hate. It seems to be one of those albums that has become a victim of being ""hip to hate on"", so to speak. I\'ve had several discussions with people who hated this album but their only real argument and conviction for hating it was the fact that it is so ridiculously beloved. My main point here is that I think that OK Computer is unquestionably a very good, perhaps even great album (though I don\'t think a perfect one) that is still a very good album despite how increasingly popular it has become to not like it.\n\nThird and final point: this is not THE Radiohead album, nor is it, in my personal opinion, the best Radiohead album. I would give that honor to Kid A any day of the week, and would make a case that In Rainbows is even a better album as a whole. To me, Kid A was the real moment of genius for this group. That is the album where all of the ideas that the band introduced and grappled with on this album truly blossomed into something bigger than themselves. Many of the instruments and new technologies brought into the fold on this album didn\'t see their full potential showcased until Kid A.\n\nThat\'s it.

He tried to gather every single piece of valuable information from the guy telling him what to do, because he was certainly not falling blindly into his trap. Oh yeah, he would fall into his trap, but it would certainly not happen without him first taking every possible precaution. He felt ready, but at the same time completely clueless, what was he to expect? Everyone he had spoken to, every author he had ever read, every TV-show, they all agreed on the fact that this was a great thing. But he just couldn\'t figure it out, not for the life of him, it was such a mystery to him, how could it be? His friends turned his back on him, they didn\'t have time for this kind of hesitation, ""just go through with it"" they said, it\'s definitely worth it.\n\nHe was getting closer, he had taken the first step. He found himself in a building, filled with sound, a strange sound, a sound he recognized, but couldn\'t place it. His friend was with him, he looked at him, with half eagerness, half disappointment. He pointed him in a direction, he couldn\'t quite understand what his friend was trying to tell him, but he followed him. ""Here"" his friend said, and handed him a plastic square of confusion. ""Is this it?"" he asked his friend, and was met with an expression he had seen many times before, a look of anger and resignation. ""Take it or leave it, I\'m done with this stupid game"". The friend exit the building, he was left on his own. He felt hopeless, ""c\'mon"" he said to himself, ""it\'s just a plastic square ffs"". He was holding it in his hand, flipped it over, discovered some numbers and words, flipped it back again. He couldn\'t quite understand it, but took it with him anyway, it was time. He came across another human being. He was intimidating. Long hair, tattooed forearms, kinda muscular, but not an athlete. He gave him the plastic square, the tattooed man looked at it, put it down, and went through some drawers located behind him. He came back with a circle of plastic, and then, for some reason, placed the circle inside the square. A circle inside a square? What is this?\n\nSuddenly he was at home, with the plastic square in hand. What to do? He entered his room, walking past what he thought was his mother and some other people, sitting there, like mummies, staring at him. He was in, he was safe, it was only him and the plastic square. Then he felt lost again, what to do? He wandered aimlessly around his room, with the plastic square squeezed firmly in his hand. His head was filled with questions, but no answer was given. But suddenly, as he was squeezing the plastic square harder and harder, he heard a click. He was startled, but kept it together. The square had opened, and the plastic circle was revealed. It was back, what was it? He took it out, held it in his hand, baffled and curious. He looked around his room, what to do? Then, in the corner, he saw the machine. The machine his father had bought him for Christmas. He went over, ""no way"" he thought, but went on to push the obvious button, the button who was staring at him. Out came a tray, he was again startled, but kept his composure. He looked at the tray, formed with a circle around a needle or laser of some kind. He thought twice, but finally took the plastic circle and placed it on the tray. It fit! He gave it a little push, and it went back inside the machine. Was it lost? Did he complete the task? He stood there for a while, didn\'t quite understand, and was about to leave the room. THEN, the machine started to play, ""what is this?"". He stared at the machine in amazement, the sounds got clearer. He was mesmerized, he couldn\'t move. He locked the door, threw himself on the bed, and stared out the window on the world outside. ""Still kisses with saliva"" the machine said, he smiled. Even thought people had knocked on the door, yelled at him, trying to make contact, he didn\'t respond. He did not leave his room that day, and people have said that the guy who came out, was not the same guy going in. No one could quite understand, but he was no longer the same person. Something had happened, something had completely altered the turn of the tide. Who was he? Was he the friend? Was he the son? Was he the brother? The customer? The classmate? The odd looking fellow? No, he was no longer any of those things.\n\nHe had become, The Tourist.']",5.00 stars

Then the disorienting swaths of digital turntablism just adds to the atmosphere of a world helplessly computerized and technological.\nThe hit of the album Paranoid Android demonstrates a haunting performance from Yorke slurring infantile moans in the verses, and a hook of him crooning a melodic and worrisome cry of fear: ""What\'s this!? What\'s that!?"" The track also features some of Jonny\'s most interesting guitar-work going from mellow Gilmour-esque Rock to hard and distorted grunge.\nSubterranean Homesick Alien slows down the momentum a bit, but exceeds at maintaining the album\'s cosmic sound and pale, despairing mood. Jonny contributes some reverberating slides and twinkling licks that float and collapse into mesmerizing mayhem.\nExit Music surprises with an upfront and personal acoustic accompaniment; a chamber-pop ditty supplied with a ghostly, bloodless back-up choir and the tinny sample of a squeaking railway to effectively create an atmosphere of urban anxiety, similar to what Pere Ubu did in The Modern Dance.\nLet Down alleviates the depression. A glittery riff from Jonny and a more uplifting refrain coupled with lyrics about Yorke\'s abstract misery lets the song exist in a state of contradiction -- it hints that sadness and pain is expected and even welcomed.\nKarma Police is the most catchy demonstration of Yorke\'s melodic whimpering. (A melody very, very similar to the Beatles\' Martha My Dear, but this can be excused due to the two songs\' obviously contrasting tones.)\nFitter Happier is the album\'s disturbing interlude with the monologue of a digital voice (either a robot or a dehumanized person) beyond a soundscape of studio fluff and other assorted audio effects to enhance the horror and disaffected despair.\nElectioneering offers hard-rock and electric blues reminiscent of Blue Oyster Cult and the Power-pop of the band\'s earlier work. It prevails at sustaining excitement.\nClimbing Up The Walls is slow and muffled with distortion, ending with a psychotic howl. In contrast, No Surprises features a very pretty melody accompanied with the sweet dings of a glockenspiel.\nAfter some writhing verses, the overwhelming triumph in the hook of Lucky suggests a happy ending for OK Computer until you hear the album\'s tragic and comatose closer The Tourist: a song of slow-moving rhythm, bass and guitar stalling with improvisation at the start for Yorke to step in and deliver an unexpectedly serene performance, lyrics vaguely about moving fast and seeing sparks (which I loosely affiliate with the ""air crash"" of the previous song). Then after all this meticulous multi-layered production, extravagant synth and compositional arrangements, emotional performances from Yorke on vocals and Jonny on guitar, how does the album end? OK Computer concludes with the last playful ding of a triangle. Who says punk is dead.']",3.50 stars

We have the first two tracks making the most of the fact that the direction of the album and the sound on it might not be entirely clear yet, before track 3 slows things down to bring context to the anthemic conclusion to the opening act of OK Computer that is track 4. Now, with a clear sound and a good idea of what the atmosphere here is, we have tracks 5 through 7 capitalizing on these notions, building and sustaining themselves upon the atmosphere of the album. Track 7 is also a great conclusion to this part, leaving the album on a bit of a cliffhanger as to where to go next, and track 8 makes fantastic use of this uncertainty to propel OK Computer in a completely new direction, thus giving us a set up to a darker final act, made great use of by track 9. Sadly, that's where the string is broken. On the last three tracks I get the impression that the bigger picture was kind of lost, track 10 feels especially out of place, a very badly timed cheerful song with little else to show for itself. Track 11 sounds like it was originally a b-side slapped in to salvage the ending as being part of the rest of the album somewhat, and track 12 is another jarring change of pace. Of course, one can argue that tracks 10 and 12 are meant to be cathartic in a way, to serve as a contrast for the darker previous sounds, but if that was the purpose, then they were just badly executed as such. Track 12 is salvaged by the fact that it is a genuinely interesting song, but I really can't say that about track 10, and overall they're way too bubbly and too close together, there was also not enough space in between the cliffhanger and track 10 to actually justify such a drastic change of sound. A cathartic track should serve as relief after a gruelling journey, not as a bump in the road.\n\nOther than that, the songwriting is pretty solid throughout, more playful at the first two tracks, more collected during the rest. I'm afraid this affects the album negatively on the second half, as there's a clear rehashing of ideas with many of the tracks that seems to not accomplish any goal other than taking up space. During the first two it is a lot more inventive, allowing for some really interesting progressions of ideas, but they ultimately seem a bit underdeveloped, with a series of unresolved ideas and dead ends, especially prevalent on track 2. The production is probably the best part of the whole ordeal, creating a dynamic and spacious sound with some very minor blemishes."", '']",3.50 stars

MasterOfShuppets,"[""There are very few bands out there that have confused me as much as the English alternative rockers Radiohead. This is a band that combined rock music with electronica to forge their own niche within the 90's alternative scene. In doing so, they have somehow became one of the most celebrated (and albeit divisive) bands not just on rateyourmusic, but in music in general. To be perfectly honest, I have never quite understood the insane devotion that Radiohead (and especially OK Computer) receives. I've often felt that the music had somewhat of a shallow and clinical tone, although I won't deny that they were an innovative group, especially when compared with the majority of other 90's alternative bands. While I have warmed to the band's sound considerably in the past year or so, but I'm still having trouble fathoming the intense love for this album. To be frank, Ok Computer isn't even my favourite Radiohead record, and I've always drifted more towards Kid A when looking for the best example of the bands creativity. You may call it redundant in me reviewing such a widely known and discussed record, but I want to finally be able to sum up my opinion of this record once and for all (assuming I don't suddenly fall in love with the album some way down the line).\n\nWhile this record does feature some electronic arrangements, this is still a rock record at heart, and it really wasn't until Kid A that these electronic parts became fully realised. It is mainly for this reason that I would pick the latter record over this one. At the end of the day however, I do have to respect Radiohead for not being afraid to experiment in order to find their own sound.\n\nThe track Airbag kicks off the record, this track begins with an oddly harsh distorted guitar riff, before launching into a much more subdued passage, while I can imagine this transition would potentially come across as a little jarring, Radiohead actually pull this off in a pretty restrained manner. Thom Yorke's mellow vocals just reach out of the mix, but I often feel that he was fighting for room over the guitars. Overall, I do like the atmosphere that this song presents, especially with the wailing guitars in the background, but personally I feel that the song could have developed more, especially in the latter portions of the track. When listening, I would often find myself checking the time left on the song.\n\nOne of the biggest hits to come from OK Computer is the second track; Paranoid Android. This track weaves through a multitude of different parts, and as a result is one of the most attention grabbing on the entire record. While the opening minute feels rather bland, the song does start to build in its atmosphere once the chorus arrives, with the vocals and the guitar leads in the background really highlighting this atmosphere. The song eventually builds into a much heavier section, which unlike on Airbag, is handled in a more well thought out manner. This section shows the band playing at the highest gear, with Yorke yelling over the mix, and with the lead guitars adding even more power to the song. The penultimate section sees the band going into the incredibly mellow and harrowing tones that they are known for. The vocals in this section actually shine through very clearly in this part, and the backing vocals add a great deal of despair to the music. While I wouldn't call myself a huge fan of Paranoid Android, I will admit that it's one of the better examples of the band's ability to craft unique, challenging and extremely melancholic music.\n\nIf I were to pick my favourite track from the record it would have to be the song Karma Police. This is one of the few moments on the record where I feel like I fully get the sound that Radiohead are going for. This track builds into a groove with a chord sequence that really brings forth the harrowing atmosphere that I feel that the band often go for. Yorke's vocals feel right at home on this track, as he sounds as if he could start crying at any minute. My only slight concern with the track is its lyrics, this song is one of the strangest songs from a lyrical standpoint that I've heard in a long time. The song seems to be discussing the idea of karma coming back to the narrator after they reported two individuals to the Karma Police, but the analogies the narrator uses (eg, buzzes like a fridge, Hitler hairdo) just sound awkward in my honest opinion. Overall however, this is one of the few tracks on OK Computer that I regularly find myself revisiting.\n\nA couple of other tracks that do stand out to me would be Exit Music (For A Film) and Let Down. Both of these tracks have a similar depressing atmosphere, but each song presents it in a considerably different manner. The first half of Exit Music relies on just the acoustic guitar and Yorke's vocals, which sound especially bleak on this track, as if he's simply giving up on life. The song Let Down has much more of a drive to it, and has an almost britpop feel to it, and as a result, I would say the song does at times slip into the generic side of music to a certain extent. With this being said however, the vocal melody has a tone of finality to it, which is one of the things that Radiohead do succeed in producing.\n\nSadly however, there are a number of tracks that just don't bring much to the table for me. Subterranean Homesick Alien feels particularly unfocused and empty for me. The song seemingly meanders throughout without really building into anything particularly effective. I'd also say that the second half of the record does show a noticeable drop in quality when compared with the first half. The first thing we hear from this half is the utterly pointless Fitter Happier track. I can appreciate the self improvement theme of the lyrics, but there is nothing appealing about hearing this from Stephen Hawking's voice box, at least not on a record. The track Climbing Up The Walls is another slower paced track with another really bland and uninteresting vocal melody. While this song does build to a somewhat intense climax, it ultimately feels wasted on such a dull melody.\n\nThankfully, the song No Surprises does save the second half of the album. This track does remind me a little of Let Down, albeit with a more subdued tone. The song does have a similar tone of finality in the vocals, and when combined with the subtle xylophone and guitar melodies, works very well in creating a particularly haunting atmosphere.\n\nThe production on here is for the most part very well done. The guitars are particularly bright, and I really admire the drum production throughout the record, the snare is especially punchy, albeit sounding a little out of place on a few of the more mellow tracks. As I mentioned earlier, the vocals have a tendency to be rather far back in the mix at times, as a result it can be somewhat of a challenge discerning what he is singing.\n\nSo in conclusion, is OK Computer a solid record? Sure. Is it deserving of the number one spot on RYM's chart,? Well that's ultimately up to you, but personally I'd have to disagree. While the album does boast some fairly innovative, bleak and well crafted material, a significant portion of the songs just lack a lot of depth or direction. A lot of Radiohead fans may just say I don't get this, and I'd agree with them to a point. However, even after revisiting this record on multiple occasions, I still don't see the godly reputation it gets. Maybe I'll come back to the album in ten years time and it'll finally click, but for now I really can't give this anything above a 7.""]",3.50 stars

KyleRainville,"['As almost everyone does, I have a story related to this album. If you\'d like to skip straight to the album analysis, skip down to the dotted lines, otherwise enjoy!\n\nI used to skulk on music forums early on in high-school fairly regularly. One album that I couldn\'t seem to escape seeing was Radiohead\'s OK Computer. I decided that I needed to buy it and see if all the hype and attention was warranted. Not long after I made that promise to myself, I received word that my Uncle had died. He didn\'t die in a normal way though, he died by falling into a river and drowning. He was drunk that day and he had a history of severe alcoholism and drug addiction. Shortly after his death, I accompanied my family to his old apartment to help clean out his belongings. The man didn\'t have anyone close to him other than siblings and nephews. (like me) As we were cleaning out his apartment, I noticed he had a fairly big music collection. I was free to choose what I wanted and take as I see fit. It\'s a weird experience taking from someone else\'s music collection and adding to your own, it feels like you\'re taking something that meant a lot to someone and making it part of yourself.\n\nI listen to albums with the possibility in my head that it may perhaps be a transcendent experience that could not only make you see life differently, but also to encapsulate you into a world that the artist has so meticulously developed and created. OK Computer is one of the albums that has shaped me to think this way. So by this logic, each album is a story or a capsule of force that enriches your life. By taking my late uncle\'s albums, they metaphorically gained a new life, a rebirth if you will, by the happenstance of a new owner.\n\nI didn\'t receive OK Computer from my Uncle\'s collection though. As I headed out with my Mom to run a few errands that same day, I decided that day was the day I\'d buy the album. I did just that at one store and when we got back in the car, I put the CD in immediately. Let\'s just say that in 9th grade, I wasn\'t ready for what this album represented and what it entailed. I distinctly remember putting the album back on the shelf after a few nonsuccessive listens but something kept drawing me back to it. In 10th grade, I returned to it with a determination to see and understand the album because I knew I had to be missing something. Seemingly, it became my sole mission in life to listen to this album. After literally 16 listens, it finally clicked for me that year. I didn\'t fully understand it yet, but I felt like I had finally gain the key to the locked door of understanding.\n\nAnd so that\'s how it was for a while, I continuously listened to this album throughout the rest of my high school career. (although not so much my senior year) The album actually inspired me and incited ideas for the topic of my junior theme. Due to this album, I wrote a 15 page thesis on the dehumanization of society through modern technology. It was an ambitious topic for a kid in 11th grade, but I was determined to write a quality paper on this topic. In the same way that OK Computer gave understanding to me, I wanted to give understanding to my teachers and my peers. I guess I must have succeeded because not only did I receive the highest marks for the paper in the class, but I also won a scholarship with it. Mission accomplished?\n\nMaybe...but maybe not. Here I am now in my first year of college and I still find myself returning to this album. Some have called it the Dark Side of the Moon for our generation and others have called it the most important album during the coming of the 21st century. Others yet said it defined and represented the oncoming digital culture filled with personal phones and social networking. I suppose I\'ll cut the personal stories out and get into this album and what it represents to me.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe album starts off with the broodingly aggressive and gloomy Airbag. Those screeching and unsettling guitar riffs kick off the trip that is Radiohead\'s third album. It\'s a song about a near-death experience in a car that Thom Yorke was in. As the vehicle crashed, seemingly dooming the narrator to silence forever, the airbag in the car popped out and saved his life. So just as technology was about to be the death of a man, another piece of technology saved him. This sets up an interesting and important dichotomy that extensively defines the ideas of this album.\n\nI\'ve heard Paranoid Android described as the modern ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and that description doesn\'t even do this song justice. I\'ve always viewed the song and its multitude of time signature changes as a concept of disillusionment from society and a jaded view of society\'s reliance on material possessions to find contentment and happiness. The progressions and climax of this song root it as one of the greatest songs Radiohead has ever put to tape.\n\nSubterranean Homesick Alien is a small little piece about isolation and cynicism. The singer can\'t seem to relate to anyone around him on any significant level. This cynicism leads him to wishes to be swooped up by aliens so he can see the world from the equivalent distance that he feels emotionally detached from it. An unsettling and relate-able piece.\n\nExit Music (For a Film) is easily one of the most haunting songs Radiohead has recorded. I\'ve always viewed it in a particular way. Judging from its placement on the album, I\'ve always thought that it had a lot to do with the previous track. Although Yorke felt detached from society, he finally found a girl who was just like him, someone he could relate very closely to. It turns out that love was not the remedy for their problems, in fact they only added to the collective depression. Together, they had come up with a scheme to kill themselves, perhaps from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car. That\'s what this song is about to me. This girl remains an important plot point as the album progresses.\n\nLet Down is easily one of the most beautiful and transcendent pieces Radiohead has ever produced. The song seems to take place after a time gap from the suicide attempt in the last song. We can assume the narrator no longer sees this girl (maybe her father found out like Yorke thought) and their suicide attempt was unsuccessful. Another interesting theory is that perhaps Yorke survived and the girl died? If this did happen, Yorke would likely have to flee from wherever he lived by some sort of transportation and the first few lines of this song here support that theory:\n\nTransport, motorways and tramlines,\nStarting and then stopping,\nTaking off and landing,\nThe emptiest of feelings,\nDisappointed people, clinging on to bottles,\nAnd when it comes it\'s so, so, disappointing.\n\nEither way, Let Down has always seemed to me to be about nihilism, depression, and absolute detachment from society. The narrator watches people carry on with their everyday lives and he just doesn\'t get it. What\'s the point? The narrator thinks that relationships, emotion, and life as we know it is futile because it all fades into nothingness by the end:\n\nDon\'t get sentimental, it always ends up drivel\n\nHis feelings from this song has led him to some sort of superiority complex when looking at others. This leads to a developed sense of prejudice, arrogance, and condescension in his mind and this is expanded upon in the next song.\n\nKarma Police is rightfully one of Radiohead\'s most popular tunes. The haunting piano intro sets the foundation for a song about judging others and finally coming to the realization that you are no better than them. By the ethereal climax of the song, the narrator realizes that this anomaly has been sorted out for his own good, and he feels a renewed sense of self by distancing his prejudice:\n\nPhew, for a minute there\nI lost myself, I lost myself\n\nFitter Happier is one of the most interesting cuts from the album and it\'s fairly simple. There\'s a computer voice that speaks slogans and capitalist motifs for a happy life; it\'s got everything in there from holding down a job, sleeping well, having a wife, driving a nice car, eating healthy, exercising and just generally being productive. This is could easily be looked at as the album\'s thematic centerpiece. As the album is about dehumanization and capitalist culture, this song represents someone who tries his best to act according to how the ""experts"" think you should act to have a good life. Despite his best efforts though, he still feels powerless and empty and he realizes that this way of living does nothing but strip all this is human right form your soul:\n\nCalm,\nFitter,\nHealthier and more productive\nA pig in a cage on antibiotics.\n\n\nElectioneering is probably the most straight-forward song on here as it\'s just an energetic rocker on the surface. Beneath the surface though, it\'s a critique and jab at politicians and various sociopolitical affairs. This song suggests that politicians are only out for power and their own gain; they don\'t care about the society at large. So far on this record, our narrator has become disillusioned and disconnected from religion, love, society, technology, drugs, culture, and now politics as well.\n\nSo after all that disconnect, what\'s left for our narrator? Enter Climbing Up the Walls, one of the eeriest pieces Radiohead has ever made. Through distortion, reverb, and great production, Radiohead create a song that not only gets in your head but also is about things going wrong in your head. This song is about the suffering and depression associated with someone who has nothing left to lose. This song\'s about someone whose mind and views on things are quickly deteriorating and the person losing hope.\n\nHow can our narrator possibly find a way out of his precarious situation? The conclusion comes in No Surprises. The glockenspiels that coat the song add a sense of irony to the whole affair. The song is about suicide and this time, carbon monoxide is cited specifically. In my interpretation, this would be Yorke\'s second attempt in the album at suicide. Although suicide is a hefty topic, this song presents it as something more tranquil and peaceful. Our narrator has realized that the \'American Dream\' if you will, is not meant for him. He realizes that all of these things that society says you need to have are nothing more than control tools used by the government and other corporations to keep making money and maintaining control of the population:\n\nA heart that\'s full up like a landfill\nA job that slowly kills you\nBruises that won\'t heal\nYou look so tired-unhappy\nBring down the government\nThey don\'t, they don\'t speak for us\nI\'ll take a quiet life\nA handshake of carbon monoxide\n\nLucky is one of the slower and more mesmerizing tracks on the album. Thematically, it\'s very similar to Airbag and it happens to be about surviving a plane crash. Fittingly enough, I\'ve come up with a theory about it. I think this song is linked closely to No Surprises. Bear with me here, if you watch the video for said song, you see Thom Yorke with some type of mask. The mask fills up with water and Thom looks like he\'s about to die from suffocation when it empties. I believe the thoughts going on in No Surprises are actually happening inside our narrator\'s head while the plane crash described in Lucky happens, take a look at these lyrics:\n\nKill me Sarah,\nKill me again with love,\nIt\'s gonna be a glorious day\n\nPull me out of the aircrash,\nPull me out of the lake,\n\'Cause I\'m your superhero,\nWe are standing on the edge\n\nFrom what I can interpret, perhaps Sarah was the girl our narrator was enamored with in Exit Music. She\'s likely the one who died in their suicide attempt. From these lyrics one can gather that her death still troubles our narrator immensely and he likely feels responsible for her death. The second set of lines that include ""superhero"" are likely not the words of our narrator but rather the words of Sarah that are still echoing in his head. Sarah wants our narrator to save her, the bring forth some sort of redemption. Sarah\'s death has caused her to be viewed as a sort of ""hero"" in the narrator\'s eyes. Due to the words of Sarah echoing in the narrator\'s head, he can\'t go through with the suicide that was talked about and planned in No Surprises. He feels like he\'s on the edge of a turning point in his life, but he\'s not sure what yet. Sarah is with him and together, they\'ll find an inevitable conclusion to their collective suffering.\n\nThe Tourist marks the end of this album and the completion of our cycle of understanding. Let\'s take a look at the lyrics and I\'ll try to wrap this up as well as I can:\n\nIt barks at no one else but me,\nLike it\'s seen a ghost.\nI guess it\'s seen the sparks a-flowin,\nNo one else would know.\n\nHey man, slow down, slow down,\nIdiot, slow down, slow down.\n\nSometimes I get overcharged,\nThat\'s when you see sparks.\nThey ask me where the hell I\'m going?\nAt a 1000 feet per second,\n\nHey man, slow down, slow down,\nIdiot, slow down, slow down.\n\nSarah\'s voice is now an imminent part of the narrator\'s brain, almost like a second conscience. The voice of Sarah is guiding him inside of his head, almost like a ghost that\'s barking things at him constantly. He\'s going crazy, and his driving reflects this. In this song, he\'s in his car driving ""1000 feet per second"". Let\'s look at these two lines:\n\nI guess it\'s seen the sparks a-flowin,\nNo one else would know.\n\nThese lines are about Sarah, or at least her conscience that lives inside the narrator. Sarah is the only one who knows what the narrator is going through and she\'s seen his problems. (""sparks a-flowin"") The line ""No one else would know"" implies that Sarah is the only person the narrator has gotten close enough to who would know about his tumultuous inner-tensions. Then we\'ve got the final and very important line:\n\nHey man, slow down, slow down,\nIdiot, slow down, slow down.\n\nNow if you haven\'t made the connection yet, I\'ll tell you, this song is the precedent to the opening track, Airbag. That leads us to a couple different conclusions and I\'ll put each one that I\'ve thought about out there for you:\n\n1. Those last lines are uttered by Sarah in the narrator\'s head, she\'s trying to pull him to reason. Soon after, the narrator gets into a car accident and that\'s when the airbag saves him. Using some of the lines from that song, you can more fully see the end of the cycle:\n\nIn an interstellar burst\nI am back to save the universe\n\nIn a deep, deep sleep\nOf the innocent\nI am born again\n\nRemember the lines in Lucky about the superhero? Well, perhaps the near-death experience has given the narrator a renewed appreciation for his life. He realizes that he is a ""victim"" of society at large. The narrator is a ""born-again"" appreciator of life, not unlike a ""born-again"" religious person. Sarah has manifested herself into the narrator\'s mind and the narrator realizes what he must do. He needs to ""save"" society, bring them to the same understanding that he has. He needs to make them see what what he and Sarah have seen. Thus the loop-cycle of the album begins, starting with the schizophrenic heroics of Paranoid Android.\n\n2. Maybe the voice that the narrator heard wasn\'t actually Sarah at all. Maybe it was actually the voice of a demon or some inter-dimensional being that imitated Sarah to get the narrator to do what the being wanted. Now what could the being have possibly wanted to gain by imitating Sarah? By manipulating the narrator into near-death experiences, the narrator\'s appreciation of life is renewed before the narrator does anything drastic. Maybe the reason that the narrator can\'t do anything about his situation is because he himself is being controlled by forces around him. Although we realize that the narrator has disconnected from almost everything, he can\'t transcend into anything greater than an average person until he leaves all human things behind. By the end of the album we realize that there was one thing that the narrator couldn\'t leave behind, and that was Sarah. Sarah herself is a metaphor for human connection, emotion, and understanding.\n\n3. The third explanation is the most far-fetched in my eyes, but it\'s still worth talking about. Maybe our narrator exists in the world but to him, it\'s not the world we see, it\'s actually his own personal purgatory, or Hell if you will. With this in mind, it makes sense to assume that the suffering of his purgatory will never end, no matter how hard he tries and fights for it to end. Every time he tries to escape, the purgatory manipulates him and prevents his actions. Although the narrator has reached somewhat of a higher level of understanding, he is doomed to stay in the same world as everyone else and watch them die or mundanely carry on doing things that don\'t matter. Sarah then is a metaphor and an important plot device for the album. Sarah represents the thing that our society is destroying and degrading; beauty. The beauty that is present in all things that we reach sooner to destroy; emotion, love, connections, sympathy, empathy, the human condition. All of it is being destroyed and our narrator can\'t stand to watch it all go.\n\nConclusion: If you\'re still reading this, I thank you for having the patience to read my theories about this record. If it wasn\'t obvious, this album is very special to me. I never get sick of the guitars, the pianos, the synths, the organs, the glockenspiels, the percussion, the smooth and rhythmic bass, or the angelic voice of Yorke. Many props go to Nigel Godrich who made this album sound like it did. Modern day Dark Side of the Moon? Maybe, but only time will tell that. This album has many themes important to society today. The album should be taken as a lesson and a cautionary tale. There\'s not much like kicking back and absorbing yourself in the malicious and non-caring world of OK Computer and every time you listen to it...you can\'t help but relate very deeply to it.\n\nBest Tracks: Paranoid Android, Let Down, Karma Police, No Surprises, Lucky\n\n9.8/10']",5.00 stars

stretalie,"['""We hope that you choke."" The big phrase that, to many, was the most memorable lyric on Radiohead\'s third LP, OK Computer. When I saw this lyric for the first time, it was well before I had listened to the album, on a banner advertising itself. By the time I was ready to listen, I had imagined a thundering roar of ""WE HOPE THAT YOU CHOKE"" to end the album, as an emotional finisher to end all finishers. Instead, I heard a whimpering, sniveling, verge-of-tears lyric over and over again at the end of ""Exit Music (For a Film). Somehow, the phrase\'s wimpy sound gives it more of an emotional boost than any amount of screaming could have. Such is the case with OK Computer. The sound does not have the emotional instability and purity of many other classic albums like it. Instead, it wedges itself into the history of rock with a sound all its own; detached, reserved, and genuinely depressed. This perfectly matches with the monotonous subject matter. The production is spotless, and crisp, keeping the music in perfect condition and bringing out instruments that would create the greatest sound possible. In short, OK Computer is an absolute and complete masterpiece of sonic experimentation unlike any other at the time. An LP that could only have been made by Radiohead.']",4.50 stars

deathprofessa47,"['The fact that Radiohead would disavow Dark Side of the Moon as an influence tells you how much deepening of their self-awareness they still needed to do between this and the first thing they did that might begin to deserve such hyperbolic praise, Kid A. And while I don\'t have much against the rest of Pink Floyd\'s discography, given the binary choice I\'m glad this site\'s algorithm favors OK Computer. (Though I do wish #1 were something... interesting. Like Trout Mask Replica. Or Lil Boat. You know, just spice it up a bit...) This is a stronger album than Dark Side, not least because mercifully, they seem to\'ve stumbled accidentally into a Big Concept Album About The Tragic Inanity Of Modern Life or Somesuch by accident. While much of the songwriting is overwrought, it tends to be operating at the liminal space between what consciousness can and can\'t confront directly in lived experience that tends to make for good poetry. I can\'t believe that Roger Waters was grappling with a problem that needed his talents when he wrote lines like ""Us and them / And after all we\'re only ordinary men,"" but at his best Thom Yorke already sounds like a Gen X Jeremiah. The panic! The screaming! The yuppies networking! Riot shields and voodoo economics! He\'s like a detuned radio! One day I am gonna grow wings! Even having heard this album so damn many times, much of it is still riveting and little of it (I\'m looking at you, ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"") is irredeemably hokey.\n\nBy any standard except conceptual sweep, to be fair, Pink Floyd isn\'t the right comparison. In order to make it to these upper flaps of the snob rock big tent, Radiohead had to absorb and rejigger the canon of charting but still tasteful rock that\'d emerged in the last 15 year, from R.E.M. to the Smiths to U2. This album couldn\'t have made such a splash if the latter weren\'t the predominant formal model through which to channel the two former. And as a result it suffers from the same problem Christgau diagnosed in The Joshua Tree: a tragic case of significance, the difference being that the band seem to already have enough of an inkling to recognize it that they could course-correct. I\'m no Steve Albini, but the bigness of the production and the relative lushness of the singing often lay it on too thick for my tastes. IMO, the deprivations they\'d subject themselves to across their next couple albums are at least as important as their electronic experiments. Look at all the adulation drowning this album here on the site, and consider the wisdom and courage it must\'ve taken to so fundamentally change course.']",4.00 stars

Stefanos_Tsougranis,"['Today, there are so many people stating that one music album is ""the best music album ever"", that seems impossible to the disheartened listener to believe such claims, ever again. But I was so glad that, for once, an album not only met these conditions, but by far exceeded them. Defending myself from being charged for exaggeration, I\'ll start presenting the reasons:\n\nMusic and Songs : After listening to many different music albums, I had formed the opinion that every song is a different entity inside an album, like a living being. OK Computer was the first album that managed to broaden my musical horizons and opinion, making each one of the single living beings a part of a bigger existence, a society (the album as a whole) while maintaining their unique-ness. The songs, even though each one different, have a smooth transition from one to another, giving a strong impression that the whole album is one song...while it isn\'t. The highly-talented musicians of Radiohead come to boost the significance of this experience with their great guitar, drums and synthesizer parts in each song, while complimenting the lyrics meaning (the guitar sounds ""alien"" in Subterranean Homesick Alien, the guitar and drums sound ""paranoid"" in the existential and unique Paranoid Android).\n\nLyrics : The lyrics of this specific album hold a great importance, because they aren\'t just expressing concerns and thoughts about our present and future society, they are making social and political commentary on an era that is changing rapidly in all levels, centered on the technological advance. The album express the stress and fear of the citizens about this advance, while not forgetting the political manipulations that push forward these advances, when needed.\n\nCreativity : The songs sound different with the brilliant conducting of Nick Ingman, feel different when taking in consideration the inspired lyrics, and can be considered one entity. If this is not creative, please feel free to tell me so.\n\nLasting Impression and Value : This is a haunting experience. Never before a music album felt so refreshing, inspiring, thoughtful and creative while reflecting the emotions of some deeply concerned with the society\'s problems music artists. That\'s when a band of artists produces a timeless music album... because art is timeless.', '']",4.50 stars

SculptureOfMan,"['I wasn\'t always a huge fan of Radiohead. For a long period of my life I found their music hard to get into, and at times rather dull. They were one of the most acclaimed British bands of all time and I just didn\'t get it. One year, I went to the Leeds Festival and they were headlining, and despite a lot of my friends being excited about the prospect of seeing them, I just wasn\'t fussed as I wasn\'t a fan. Despite this, I thought I\'d go and see them anyway, as I heard they were good live, and by the end of their set, I finally did get it. To describe their show using a word which doesn\'t do it justice, it was mindblowing.\n\nI stubbornly tried not to pursue my interest in them as I wanted to stick to my word of ""not being a fan"", but I just couldn\'t help myself. I fell in love with them and felt like such an idiot for previously dismissing their clearly incredible music. My friends would tease me about the huge u-turn I did in regards to my stance on Radiohead, but I didn\'t care. I finally knew just why so many regard them as one of the greatest bands ever.\n\nDuring a period of listening to little else but Thom Yorke\'s intricate, innovative, boundary pushing conglomerate of world class musicians, I came to find that OK Computer is my favourite album of their\'s. A lot of people cite Kid A as their finest work, and I agree that it is an incredible album, but there\'s something so irrepressibly epic about this album. It marks the point between where they were still a conventional guitar band, and where they delved into uncharted musical territory. The songs are primarily guitar driven but the guitars are used to create noises that you wouldn\'t expect.\n\nParanoid Android is one of the greatest songs ever written. Period. It has been compared to Queen\'s Bohemian Rhapsody many times. Not surprising. Both songs begin in a rather quiet place before becoming louder and louder before, culminating in an explosive climax which features iconic guitar work. But whilst Bohemian Rhapsody is an epic opus of Glam and Stadium Rock glory, Paranoid Android is anything but glorious. It is nihilistic and bitter, cynical and schizophrenic, volatile and misanthropic. The tempos change, the guitars become gnarlier and the vocals become angrier. The band have said that they wrote the song as a joke. Strange, because jokes serve the basic purpose of making someone laugh, not making someone feel several emotions.\n\nThe other singles are amazing too. No Surprises, with it\'s distinctive guitar hook, is a rather poignant but cathartic number, whilst the slow paced Lucky is pure bleakness featuring guitars that make the darkness sound beautiful. Karma Police is like the twisted, demented cousin of Oasis\' Don\'t Look Back In Anger. That song is like an affable friend, whilst this one is a lone creepy person.\n\nThe album is consistently great. Airbag emits textures of ambience using nothing but guitars and Electioneering is the sound of the apocalypse, if you could hear someone playing an amazing guitar solo whilst the world is being destroyed around you.\n\nJust when the golden period of British rock which was the 1990s looked like it was starting to die, with Oasis releasing the self indulgent, coke addled and critically panned (but nonetheless good) Be Here Now, Blur looking to the American Grunge bands for influences as opposed to writing their usual quirky Pop songs, Pulp also wanting to avoid the Britpop sound which made them popular and the Manic Street Preachers losing their angry Punk-esque nihilisim in favour of radio friendly anthems, Radiohead emerged with this masterpiece. They showed to the world that there was more to music from the United Kingdom than Britpop, and as opposed to the fun, anthemic, poppy songs of Britpop, this album is anything but. It is dark, brooding and misanthropic. And better than Definitely Maybe, Parklife and Different Class.\n\nThe only British albums from the 1990s that I can think of which are superior to OK Computer are The Holy Bible by the Manic Street Preachers and Pulp\'s This Is Hardcore, two albums which are also dark and uncomfortable to listen to, and are the sound of a band deliberately trying to alienate casual listeners for the sake of artistic license.\n\nMoral of the story is, give any band a chance. Don\'t dismiss them just because you don\'t like the sound of them, and if you follow that rule you may end up reaping the rewards of it, like I was with Radiohead.']",5.00 stars
dogshitman,"['With an album as renowned and legendary as OK Computer, you\'d think that all contemporary reviews could just be whittled down to a generic ""What can be said about this album that hasn\'t already been said?"", but that\'s not the case. 20 years later and people are still finding things to say about this album. Maybe it\'s because younger people keep discovering. Maybe it\'s because people find that its themes of technological anxiety are being more relevant with time. Maybe it\'s both. Especially with its 20th anniversary this year, it\'s been back in the spotlight and the center of dozens of articles on music sites. One I saw from Pitchfork described Fitter Happier\'s lyrics as ""robot overlords commands for humans"" or something like that. I know music is very subjective, but I don\'t think I\'m alone in thinking that Pitchfork is way off with that interpretation. Thom Yorke himself has called Fitter Happier\'s lyrics as ""the most depressing thing he\'s ever written"". The track isn\'t much more than a list of mundane qualities and lifestyle choices that are typically deemed desirable and by the general public. TV, magazines, our peers, they all tell us that going to the gym is good, safe cars are good, eating healthily is good. Everybody should do these things. Everybody on Earth should be the same and live this ideal western lifestyle. And what do you say to this list? ""No, I don\'t want to eat healthy, or get along with coworkers, or worry about my safety!"" Of course not, you\'d be an asshole. Thom says these are his most depressing lyrics and I think it\'s because the advice this robotic voice is giving isn\'t bad advice. A lot of the things he said would lead to ""the ideal life"". You could stray from this advice, but what would it lead to? Reckless behaviour, binge drinking, an irritating personality, and ultimately social isolation. The title of the album is an allusion to the submissive acceptance of the sterile, benign instructions for a ""normal life"". He\'s not saying ""I shall do your bidding computer!"", but he\'s also not saying ""No way, fuck your advice computer!"", it\'s just an unenthused ""OK computer"". I think that\'s why people find this album so depressing, because it\'s an acceptance of the societal assimilation of uniqueness. No use fighting it, you can\'t survive unless you conform to the way the world works. A more and more calculated lifestyle, the only casualty is a unique human experience.\n\nOK']",4.50 stars

Given it's high reputation, I expected to think that it's overrated, even taking into consideration that RYM is more rock-oriented than I'll ever be. However, I LOVE this album. I could spend all day describing the technical details that make it great, but ultimately, what it boils down to is that this is, simply put, fantastic music. That's all there is to it.

OK Computer came out and I thought that while it\'s had some good tunes, without being able to put my finger on it, I just felt there was something not quite right about it. A couple of years after it came out (on a Christmas Eve in fact) I was coming down with the chicken pox although I didn\'t actually know it yet. I was feeling a bit spacey and a bit out of it and had this record on and it\'s the first time I remember it clicking with me, specifically the song ""Lucky"". This was when I realised that the ""something not quite right"" feeling was purposefully built into the album by Radiohead, it was the essence of what the band wanted to get across. Since I first came up with my favourite 10 albums of all time list, probably 14 or 15 years ago now, there have been a couple of changes but OK Computer has been a consant. It\'s gotten better with age and now never fails to blow my mind. Its records like this that make me so passionate about music. Airbag introduces the album with a riff that\'s got a hint of the East about it but the vocals, guitars and rhythm section come together beautifully to begin this masterpiece. Only Radiohead could write something so magical about a car safety device. This leads into the epic Paranoid Android, up there with Bohemian Rhapsody as one of those songs whose creation process will raise as many questions as the origins of the Universe itself. The paranoia levels are maintained across the rest of the album. At its heart is the track ""Let Down"", a song that just swells with downbeat emotion and is one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded by a rock band. ""Electioneering"" and ""Climbing Up The Walls"" give you that frantic feeling of being stuck in a broken elevator and are particularly easy to relate to these days. ""No Surprises"" calms everything back down and the album cruises to a relaxed finish with ""Lucky"" and ""The Tourist"".

NeoSurrealistDadaRevival,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'This album is often hailed as Radiohead\'s masterpiece, but I\'m inclined to disagree. It loses its potency about halfway through, starting at the godawful Fitter Happier, and never fully recovers until The Tourist. But hey, all of the songs before that are actually quite amazing. Hell, if the first six songs and perhaps The Tourist were released on an EP and everything else scrapped, OK Computer would have likely been one of the best EPs of the 90s.\n\nAnyways, lets start on a light note by talking about the first several tracks. This album kicks off with Airbag, which is probably my favorite song off of this album. It\'s one of Radiohead\'s best ""upbeat"" songs, and manages to be fairly creative and highly atmospheric while still be very accessible. Paranoid Android is also an amazing track, and likely the most (successfully) experimental track off of OK Computer, smoothly transitioning though several, completely different phases before it ends somewhat suddenly to great effect. Subterranean Homesick Alien probably the lushest song here, with heavy use of electronic instrumentation and effects. Exit Music (For a Film) is probably the heaviest track, and is actually genuinely depressing. It\'s fairly minimalistic and actually seems to predict the general direction of Radiohead\'s next album Kid A. Let Down\'s titled is misleading because it\'s not actually a letdown (HA HA LOOK GUYS I MADE A FUNNY LAUGH WITH ME LAUGH AT MY JOKE PLEASE ;___;). Hell, Let Down is probably the most upbeat song on this album, even though it\'s not as ""out there"" as the other highlights. After that is ""Karma Police"", which is likely the most popular song off of OK Computer, and it\'s easy to see why. It\'s probably the best song lyrically, and the music really captures the vibe Radiohead seems to be going for. This would have been a great end to OK Computer if it was an EP.\n\nBut sadly, Fitter Happier had to happen. Really, the term ""pretentious hipster bullshit"" has never been more applicable to a song than here. I can sort of see what Radiohead was going for here, but they really miss the mark. Fitter Happier might have worked as an intro to a longer song, but on its own, it\'s shit. As bad as Fitter Happier is, at least it still kept with OK Computer\'s general mood. The next song, Electioneering, although a fairly solid rocker, is completely out of place here. Climbing Up the Walls is probably the most unmemorable track on this album, and beyond that, there\'s not too much to say. No Surprises is actually pretty good, but is also a bit out of place, although not as nearly as much as Electioneering is. Lucky is another unmemorable tune like Climbing Up the Walls, but does manage to be somewhat more interesting. After all of this shit, OK Computer actually manages to finish up on a high note with The Tourist, which is pretty damn breathtaking. It\'s just a shame so much mediocre and out of place material came before it.\n\nSo what\'s the final verdict on OK Computer? Well, I can some it up as an album with a great first half, a mediocre second half, and a great end. If you cut out all of the out of place and flat out bad material, OK Computer would live up to its reputation. Still, the good tracks are good enough so I\'d feel bad to give it anything lower than a 4 out of 5. It\'s also a big step forward for Radiohead, and they did seem to be experimenting a lot. It\'s just that they\'d end up doing much better on later releases. If the bland tracks were distributed throughout the album rather than all concentrated in the second half, I\'d probably rate it higher. When you really think about it, OK Computer is an example of how the tracklist organization can actually end up ruining an album. Anyways, I just don\'t see what the big deal is here. As the ever so infamous Piero Scaruffi said, Radiohead is basically ""faux avant-garde"". However, unlike him, I don\'t see OK Computer as the masterpiece of it.\n\nEdit: My opinion of this album has shifted a bit since I last reviewed it, and probably not for the better. Still think the second half is definitely the weakest aside from ""The Tourist"", but I find the whole album a bit lacking.']",3.50 stars

Its eerie, odd, all over the place and somewhat distant, its solid in what it is but by no means does it impress me. Its a good album worth the time of anyone who desires to hear every kind of music at least once like I am. If you simply want to search for THE sound you want and know it’s out there but don’t know what that sound is, you do have to check this album out for yourself, don’t follow any ones overwhelming opinions like the 2 examples I used, and if you do check this album out, good luck friend.\n\n---------\n\nWhat a cryptic statement of mine that is. Its about a year later since that “review”, whatever it is and I have decided after extensive musical discoveries since then to start the year 2013 with a “Radiohead Day”, because their discography really is one I need to get through. Having listen to every album twice (more or less) and relistening to “Ok Computer” I would like to say I have a much much much better grip and understanding of this band. So here it goes: my much better review of Ok Computer:\nStarting with “Airbag”, this song is way better than I remember, making me think of Our Lady Peace’s Naveed and then the surprising warping of noise at the end which I have to say I really like. Now I hear “Paranoid Android” is considered still to this day one of Radiohead’s best songs, and they might be right, its very powerful and kind of like “Airbag” but with more purpose and emotion. Something this album suddenly feels to weigh out to me – purpose. “Subterranean Homesick Alien” is rather spacious and easy, though it glides and doesn’t feel like a pointless “we need this” ballad like many songs of this structure feel to me in later albums. I never really got why people compared Muse to Radiohead, but now “Let Down” has showed it to me, damn. But I will say “Let Down” is beautiful, again, spacious and with REAL (not forced) emotion and some since of strange purpose. Very very good song. “Karma Police” is another very… just wow, rather genuine and clean, not stained by the ego I think this band gains in later years. To me this album is just working on music, not on the image Radio head seems to garner after this album. Maybe this is what happened. This was the catalyst… I think I’m getting it now. More about that later. More reminding me of Our Lady Peace with “Electioneering” which has some killer guitar, which most of the album really does. The back and forth with the upbeat and melancholy really gives an odd but delightful vibe to this album, something I feel is lost on later albums actually. The prime example is after the happy and energetic “Electioneering”, you get saturated in melancholy with the dismal and powerful “Climbing Up the Walls”. I guess they thought “hey, lets get even sadder with “No Surprises””, but I will say there is a slight feeling of hopefulness in those lullaby like twinkles and atmosphere. Besides really good guitar and that deep space feeling on very song “Lucky” and “The Tourist” just follow in the steps of “Climbing Up the Walls” and “No Surprises” but not as good I guess, but there isn’t a bad song on this album, not at all. Hopefully I understand this album way better now than I did a year ago. I feel like I do. Its pure, its genuine and very common, and that makes it rather uncommon. I feel like the albums to follow don’t possess this genuine feeling, not trying to say they lost themselves, but rather found themselves and knew what to do, therefore Radiohead gained much confidence and cockiness, therefore losing their modesty. But they are still really talented, so I guess…. I guess its ok.']",4.50 stars

GeneralError,"['So now I\'ve finally dared to seriously listen to what, according to RYM, is the #1 album of all times, which I have always strongly doubted -- I listened to this once about 10 years ago, it didn\'t leave any memories.\n\nMy first impression was: Although the music is interesting, complex and often beautiful -- I just can\'t stand Thom Yorke\'s singing. That bloody nagging, bratty voice and this moaning singing that was oh so en vogue in 90s britpop. It gets on my nerves on a very basic, primal level, so I knew I wouldn\'t be able to really enjoy this album; especially ""The Tourist"" really hurts my ears. However, on further listens, I started getting a little used to that voice, and the songs where Yorke\'s singing stays in the background started growing on me, like ""Airbag"" and ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"". It wasn\'t too artsy-fartsy as I feared, the production is immaculate, and the songs are full of little surprises, synth details, interesting twists, without breaking apart, staying a coherent, pleasing whole.\n\nAnd that exactly is my gripe with this album. It s a little too coherent and pleasing for me to really raise my interest. It all feels too intellectual, too thought-out, too self-conscious, too slick and polished to me. For me, great music needs more than just a pleasing melancholic mood (melancholy sells well), it needs more than sophistication and ideas -- it needs an element of irrationality, of spontaneity and exuberance, of revolt and fracturedness: of PERSONALITY. Which OK Computer just doesn\'t have. And thus, it can\'t compare with, i.e., Angel Dust, my own personal perfect 1990s alt rock album.\n\nAnd of course, great music needs a voice that doesn\'t piss me off. Considering this, the fact I have this album a good rating is no minor feat. It is no coincidence that my favourite on here is ""Fitter Happier"", this weird text read by some Microsoft Windows 3.x-style computer voice -- this is the only song that has some genuine darkness and experimentality (and none of that nasty voice).\n\nAll in all, as much as I would have liked (pompous ass that I am), I can\'t say this is a bad album, quite on the contrary: it\'s a remarkable britpop album with a proggish edge for mature mainstream alt/indie audience, and I understand now why it is so popular. But no way would I call it ""greatest album ever"".']",3.50 stars

slipstreams11,"['I have interesting feelings over this album.\n\nIf you were to strip away every single concept from this album, it sounds pretty alright. It\'s atmospheric and melancholy in strange, jagged ways and that\'s kind of neat. It does it well enough that I think this would probably be a really nice experience for some people. It\'s a little too lacking in energy and purpose to appeal to me for more than a few songs at a time but still, it\'s not bad and it\'s not exceptional, and it fills your ears in a respectably pleasant, consistent way and for that I give it the score it has.\n\nSo what about the concepts? Actually ... that overarching ""oh woe is me, I am so sophisticated and modernity is making me so lifeless and purposeless"" thing irritates the crap out of me and as a result I can\'t really warm up to the genuinely decent melodies on here.

wordswithoutletters,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(note: I want to have a review written for at least the top 50 albums by the time this summer is over. This is the first review in that project.)\n\nWhen this album was released I was a year and a half old. I doubt my dad ever played it for me when I was so young; actually, talking to him about the album years later, when I was fourteen or fifteen, he explained to me that it took him six months to buy it because he wanted to wait for the hype to die down. He was afraid that if he bought it right away, he\'d be disappointed. after the soaring, angst-filled yet beautiful The Bends, my dad was among the many waiting for the best pop album of all time. It\'s probably for the best that he tempered his expectations. This album was not made for him. He still enjoyed it, of course -- but Radiohead had something else in mind.\n\nIt\'s actually strange to me, then, because this is the first album I have a distinct memory of listening to, really listening to, free of distractions, giving my full attention. I was in third grade. My dad would play ""Fitter Happier"" sometimes and I thought it was funny. I thought the song itself was called ""OK Computer"". I had a shitty little CD player, I\'d had it for a few years then. By this point it had lost the ability to skip tracks. So I popped in the CD and figured I\'d just wait for it to get to track 7, thought it would only take a few minutes.\n\nI don\'t remember what I thought of ""Airbag"" then, but I do remember listening to ""Paranoid Android"" for the first time very clearly. The eerie jangly guitar that opens the song grabbed my attention immediately. And the sudden mood shifts scared the crap out of me. It was probably the most progressive song I had heard up till that point, but I don\'t know for sure. But I remember it so clearly.\n\nThe problem with this album, and writing about it, is that it\'s become impossible for me -- and so many others -- to separate their emotional bonds with it from the music\'s actual, individual merit. But I think that\'s in part because Thom Yorke and Co. did such a brilliant job at tapping right into the reservoirs of existential angst that were following us as the 90\'s turned over into the new millennium. Even ""Exit Music (For a Film) which could have been a simple throwaway track for the Romeo + Juliet soundtrack, has the haunting mellotron arrangement, gently whispered vocals, the jaw-dropping drum break and of course the eerie samples during the fade out. And it\'s basically the best song ever written for a movie, in my opinion. Yet it wasn\'t even nominated for the Original Song Oscar. Wonder why.\n\nI know I rated a stretch of tracks 4 and under -- but that\'s in part because those tracks don\'t really transcend the beauty of the album. Well, ""Karma Police"" was a victim of being awfully overplayed. It\'s a good tune, but I\'m a little bitter that it was the most successful single from the album here in the U.S. ""Electioneering"" is a great rocker and would be a highlight on any other album, but here it plays it safe in comparison to the crazy innovations we see elsewhere on the album. ""Climbing Up the Walls"" is brilliant, and the string arrangement is mindblowing, but it\'s also so painfully bleak that it\'s tough for me to listen to when I\'m not listening to the album straight through. But I wouldn\'t bat an eye if someone else were to cite them as a highlight, they\'re just not what stood out to me.\n\nBut I feel the album hits its peaks when Thom mixes cautious optimism into the albums generally bleak, uncertain mood. ""No Surprises"" is a bright but melancholy song, and it\'s unbelievable to me that it reached the top 10 in the U.K. And then there\'s ""Let Down"".\n\n""Let Down"" is probably my favorite song of all time. That\'s partially because it\'s gotten me through lots of tough times, but it\'s also brilliant, musically. Let me outline why I think this for you:\n1. The guitar is playing in a different time signature than the rest of the song. This plays back into the song\'s general idea of trying to find your place in the world.\n2. Each element of the song gets more and more confident as the song goes on. For example: the uncertain guitar which opens the song shifts to being assertively strummed at the song\'s climax. Similarly, Thom\'s vocals, which at first sound fragile and vulnerable, shift to confident, graceful, and soaring.\n3. The lyrical turns of phrase allow the song\'s chorus (One day, I am gonna grow wings/A chemical reaction) to turn from an ironic, scathing comment on today\'s society (i.e., there are so many chemicals in the world that I will mutate, grow wings and escape) to a life-affirming sentiment when they\'re prefaced with ""You\'ll know, you\'ll know where you are...""\n4. When the harmonies kick in at 4:00, it\'s perhaps my favorite moment in any song, and has moved me to tears several times.\n5. The outro -- which consists of an acoustic guitar and arpeggiating synths -- has the comforting effect which drives home the ultimate point which I drew from the song, that is: everything will be okay.\n\nThe thing is, I\'ve only begun to skim the surface, and I could do this for every song on this album. All of them. I won\'t, but the point is, this is an incredible album, the kind of album where I wouldn\'t question anyone choosing any track as their favorite. And it\'s become such a deeply ingrained, personal album for me, but I\'m confident that everyone with an interest in rock music can find something here.\n\nI wonder if I\'ll see another album like this released in my lifetime. Who knows? Do they make them like this anymore?']",5.00 stars
checkeredtape,"[""EMI shows how great it is at marketing. It is not bad but it is not the greatest album ever made either. I can see why it people love it so much, the electronics used in a time when there was a big rebellion against it (Britpop and Grunge) and they were used to make texture and atmosphere and not to get a cheap synth pop hit (How much credit can Radiohead take from that? A lot of it has to do with the improvements of synths and effects pedals etc. from the 80s) and Nigel Godrich's production put together the acoustic, electro-acoustic and electronic experiments into a seamless statement plus pop songwriting was at the core.

Maciej_Morawski,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Choć czas sobie uświadomić, że OK Computer nie jest jakimś szczytem szczytów ani muzyki w ogóle, ani nawet muzyki rockowej, to trzeba tej płycie oddać wielkość pewnego rodzaju. W pewnych kategoriach rzeczywiście może być najlepszym albumem wszech czasów, a mianowicie w kategoriach pop-rockowych. Choć wiele wielkich słów zostało powiedzianych o przełomowości i progresywności tej płyty, należy ona wszak ciągle do szeroko pojętej rodziny pop-rockowej, niebezpośrednio (jak, powiedzmy, post-bop do bebopu), ale zdecydowanie.\n\nBo z jednej strony zabiegi w pewnym sensie „progresywne”, z drugiej wciąż zwrotka-refren-zwrotka-refren-mostek-refren i bazowanie na arcyzgrabnych, choć jednak dość prostych emocjonalnych klimaksach, jakie chwycą za serce legiony odbiorców, których tylko nie odstraszy niesztampowe brzmienie i ciężka jak na pop atmosfera (a jak pokazuje popularność Radiohead w Internecie, popularność ich albumów i koncertów – nie odstraszyła całych zastępów ludzi). To tłumaczy też fenomen albumu, to znaczy czemu tak często jest to album wygrywający rankingi. W pewnej mierze zaspokaja oczekiwania ambitniejszego odbiorcy muzyki rozrywkowej, wynagradzając prostotę kompozycji prawie wszystkich utworów interesującymi aranżacjami, klimatem i jednym bardziej złożonym kawałkiem, a z drugiej strony dzięki piosenkowej strukturze nie zniechęca słuchacza typowo popowego, przy odrobinie wysiłku z jego strony dając mu jeszcze w dodatku poczucie obcowania z czymś nie z tego świata.\n\nWiele w temacie wyjaśnia zresztą tutejszy opis gatunku rocka alternatywnego, do którego bardzo zgodnie OK Computer należy: „Alternative rock is a style of Rock music that generally consists of typically Pop Rock-based song structures performed with a less commercial, more underground sensibility.” Dokładnie takie podejście zostało tu przyjęte przez Radiohead i trzeba przyznać, że zostało doprowadzone do mistrzostwa.\n\nGrupa poczyniła w ciągu ledwie dwóch lat (znowu) imponujący progres, choć zachowując znaczącą ciągłość z poprzednim osiągnięciem. Jak już sygnalizowałem, prawie każdy kawałek na OK Computer to – tak samo jak na The Bends – piosenka pop-rockowa o prostej kompozycji zwrotkowo-refrenowej, której głównym zadaniem jest zbudowanie, a następnie erupcja klimaksu emocjonalnego. Ale to tylko jedna trzecia historii. Artystyczne/progresywne/alternatywne walory ujawniają się na paru polach, przy czym przede wszystkim w oryginalnym brzmieniu/aranżacjach i atmosferze (dwa podstawowe kierunki, w których należy podążać, jeśli chce się tworzyć ambitną muzykę rozrywkową, a nie mając znaczących predyspozycji kompozytorskich czy improwizatorskich – wcale niewielu to zrozumiało, przed RH chociażby Joy Division, Cocteau Twins czy My Bloody Valentine). I w jedynej bardziej skomplikowanej formalnie kompozycji, Paranoid Android.\n\nAranżacje i będące ich efektem brzmienie to skutek eklektycznych inspiracji, pomiędzy wieloma pośledniejszymi dwóch tak prominentnych jak Bitches Brew i Tren dla ofiar Hiroszimy. Co prawda osoba, która przed zapoznaniem się z albumem o nich przeczyta, będzie mocno rozczarowana, bo mówimy o jednych ze ściśle najwybitniejszych muzycznych osiągnięć XX wieku, a efekt jest bardzo odległy od ich wielkości, natomiast swoje najwidoczniej zrobiły (oczywiście dużo więcej ta pierwsza inspiracja). W każdym utworze jest trochę inaczej, ale możemy wskazać chociażby na: bardzo zróżnicowane podejście do korzystania z gitar, a nawet do perkusji; śmiałość w wykorzystywaniu bardzo różnorodnych, syntetycznych i akustycznych dźwięków i wplatania ich w odpowiednich momentach; dobra robota odwalona w studio, dzięki której dźwięk zdaje się często rozchodzić na dużej przestrzeni; w końcu walory brzmieniowe wokalu Yorke’a, który na pierwszych dwóch albumach był jeszcze wokalistą średnio interesującym. Jedno, co mi się nie podoba, to znacznie za głębokie schowanie linii basowych w miksie, zwłaszcza że często są bardzo ładne. Tak czy inaczej stapia się to fragmentami w piękną masę.\n\nTak chwalony klimat albumu jest w pełnej krasie obecny tylko na części utworów, ale powiedzmy, że emanują nim one na utwory pozostałe i można nazwać OK Computer dziełem o mocnej i oryginalnej, aktualnej w swoich czasach atmosferze dekadenckiej neurozy, melancholii, samotności, pesymistycznego spojrzenia na przyszłość, alienacji we współczesnym świecie, coraz mocniej rugującym z życia wszystko poza pracą i hedonistyczną konsumpcją, niepokoju przed rozwojem technologii. Poprowadziło do owej atmosfery między innymi wspomniane brzmienie, a również minorowe i pełne dysonansów harmonie, umiejętnie melancholijne melodie i ekspresja wokalna Yorke’a.\n\nAirbag, utwór rzadko wymieniany wśród największych osiągnięć Radiohead, w gruncie rzeczy zasługuje na miejsce w ich gronie. Poprzez niego album od początku narzuca swoją neurotyczną, melancholijną atmosferę. Hipnotyzująca rytmicznie i brzmieniowo perkusja, różnorodne i otaczające zewsząd gitary nadające poświaty paranoicznej, ledwo dostrzegalny, ale pięknie wzbogacający fakturę bas i fatalistyczny, ekstatycznie depresyjny wokal Yorke’a, mocno rezonujące brzmienie. W końcu świetna melodia z niezłymi zabiegami chromatycznymi.\n\nParanoid Android zalicza się do ściśle najlepszych osiągnięć zespołu i w ogóle muzyki rozrywkowej nie tylko dlatego, że twardo przełamuje prostą formułę rockowej piosenki (wychodzi od takowej, lecz schizofreniczna pieśń zostaje brutalnie przerwana przez wściekłą burzę zniekształconych, ostrych gitarowych riffów, by przejść w rozpaczliwą, emocjonalnie rozdartą elegię i zakończyć się drugim atakiem agresji – trzy oblicza umiarkowanie do siebie pasujące, tutaj z wyczuciem połączone w doskonale współgrającą całość). To również utwór o rzadko spotykanej w rocku precyzji fakturalnej, imponującej zwłaszcza na obszarze gęsto usianych gitar, o pięknych i często dysonansowych melodiach, inteligentnych harmoniach budujących bardzo mroczny klimat. To perełka brzmieniowa, prezentująca trzy różne brzmieniowe oblicza, przy czym szczególnie imponujące jest to pierwsze, z gąszczem gitar o zróżnicowanej barwie, melotronem i schizofrenicznym wokalem Yorke’a. W końcu to bomba atmosfery, wychylającej się już z OK Computer w stronę następnych albumów zespołu, nie tyle neurotycznej i melancholijnej, co po prostu pełnej lęku i depresyjnej. Jeśli odmówić tego statusu całemu albumowi, trzeba się chyba przynajmniej zgodzić, że Paranoid Android to arcydzieło muzyki rozrywkowej, choć moim zdaniem nawet w ogólnych kategoriach muzycznych robi spore wrażenie.\n\nSubterranean Homesick Alien powraca do bliższej Airbag atmosfery bezpieczniejszego neurotyzmu i melancholii, jak i do prostej piosenkowej formy. Jest jednak fantastycznym utworem po pierwsze dzięki sile tej atmosfery, po drugie dzięki pięknemu brzmieniu ze swobodnie rozchodzącymi się w przestrzeni dźwiękami gitary i klawiszy, zaszczepiającej atmosferze cząstkę kosmosu, po trzecie ekspresyjnemu wokalowi, po czwarte świetnym melodiom i po piąte dzięki emocjonalnemu klimaksowi w refrenie, jednemu z najlepszych jakie udały się Radiohead.\n\nApetyt w tym momencie jest ogromny, ale zaczyna się zjazd. Pierwsza część Exit Music zda się zaledwie pretekstem to spektakularnego klimaksu na sam koniec, aczkolwiek jest on na tyle udany, że wybacza się prostotę i nieco zbyt dosłowny smutek tego długiego wstępu. Zgrabnie bardzo wyszedł kontrast jego ciszy i względnego spokoju z hałasem i rozpadem emocjonalnym finału. W Let Down zespół niepotrzebnie wycofuje się z neurozy i pozostawia samą melancholię, w dodatku przyprawioną trochę zbyt mocną dawką słodyczy; struktura piosenki jest już naprawdę banalna. Mimo to wychodzi obronną ręką dzięki urzekającym melodiom, błyszczącym, połyskliwym dźwiękom gitar i elektrycznego pianina, zgrabnemu połączeniu dwóch linii wokalnych pod koniec i – jak zwykle – rozczulającemu klimaksowi wokalnemu Yorke’a. Karma Police ucieka w stronę zachowawczego pop rocka niestety jeszcze mocniej. Wciąż liczba zalet jest niemała – udane przełamywanie gitar elektrycznych fragmentami z samym fortepianem, ładne melodie i na koniec powrót do ciekawszego brzmienia ze ślizgającą się gitarą w roli głównej. Można żałować jednak, że zamiast zapychać album takimi przyjemnymi banałami, nie zdecydował się zespół na rozwinięcie następnego na liście Fitter Happier, które jest ze wszech miar dobrym pomysłem, mimo że trochę za mało śmiałym i zbyt miniaturowym. Mogłoby pięknie skonsolidować neurotyczny klimat albumu w bardziej rozwiniętej formie, ale i tak robi swoje.\n\nDość mocno oderwane od rdzenia Electioneering ze swoją nieposkromioną energicznością wydaje się jeszcze jedną bombą bezpośrednich młodzieńczych emocji rodem z The Bends, przy czym na rzeczonym albumie byłby to jeden ze ściśle najlepszych kawałków. Są tu jedne z najbardziej porywających gitarowych riffów, jakie Radiohead kiedykolwiek dostarczyło, całość jest również rytmicznie chwytliwa i tętni naprawdę arcyprzyjemną energią, więc tu akurat wybaczam pozbycie się programowej atmosfery albumu. Climbing Up the Walls powraca do neurozy i smutku, a jest to jeden ze szczerszych wyrazów smutku na albumie; Yorke ze zdewastowanym emocjonalnie wokalem w świetnej formie, melodie o nieodpartym uroku i w końcu bardzo umiejętna, śmielsza niż zazwyczaj aranżacja, obtaczająca piosenkę z jednej strony w nienachalne smyczki, a z drugiej w surrealistyczne elektroniczne dźwięki.\n\nNo Surprises to najsilniejszy wyskok w stronę popu, ale jest to pop z duszą i ładnymi emocjami. Formalnie rzecz banalna, może poza niezłą melodią linii wokalnej, zdobywa mnie jednak zgrabnym zabiegiem przedstawienia załamania nerwowego pod maską błogiego uśmiechu oraz – w przeciwieństwie do podobnego trochę Let Down – wcale mimo swej słodyczy nieodbiegającą bardzo od rdzenia albumu atmosferą, nieco oniryczną dzięki wykorzystaniu dzwonków. Elegijny smutek w Lucky jest może odrobinę zbyt oczywisty, ale rozsądnie zaprawiony niepokojem i wzbogacony psychodelicznymi gitarami, natomiast refreny tego utworu to wzorcowe wykorzystanie patosu. The Tourist to doskonale trafiony closer. Powraca raz jeszcze atmosfera neurozy, melancholii, osamotnienia z początku albumu, cudownie słucha się wykończonego Yorke’a, urzeka senność i lamentacyjne melodie, zaś refreny, szczególnie wydłużony ostatni, to już doprawdy małe arcydzieło Radioheadowych klimaksów, zapewne dlatego, że angażuje się w nie mocno nie tylko wokal, ale też gitary i perkusja, a poza tym mają wydźwięk nie tyle emocjonalny, co kathartyczny.\n\nKiedyś uważałem ten album za obłędnie równy, już nie uważam (aczkolwiek wreszcie udało się RH nagrać płytę bez ani jednego koszmarka, ba, nie ma tu nawet nic przeciętnego). W gruncie rzeczy tylko połowa piosenek spełnia obietnice, jakie składane są słuchaczowi: obietnice wspaniałych aranżacji i intensywnej atmosfery. Druga połowa na ogół nie odcina się od tych walorów całkowicie, jednak jest mocno złagodzona. To ogromna szkoda. Wciąż jest to album bardzo imponujący (już poza tym że obłędnie przyjemny) i nie podoba mi się odsądzanie go od fałszywej awangardy. Jasne, sporo osób zostało przezeń uwiedzionych i już nie wypuszczonych wyżej, ale to chyba tylko ich wina, natomiast proszę się zastanowić, jak wielu osobom ten album jako łącznik pomiędzy mainstreamowym a ambitniejszym podejściem do muzyki otworzył bramy do czegoś więcej. Jestem zresztą w pewnej mierze jedną z nich.

GARFIELDACRES,"['A big step forward musically and sonically if not particularly song wise from ""the bends"" the bands follow up ""ok computer"" is touted as the ""dark side of the moon"" of its generation and counted as One of the best albums ever made in music polls .\n\nWhat you actually hear is a band experimenting , with electronic textures,with nods to prog rock and eastern musics in the guitar sounds, with atonal effects and vintage synths. It says a lot for the bands natural melodicism that they manage to make the whole thing sound so appealing ,even though its far from commercial. Much of that of course is to do with yorkes vocals -superbly recorded and performed.\n\nFrom the droning guitars and squelchy synth sounds of ""airbag"" through the suite like ""paranoid android"" and the white album homage of ""karma police"" the record rarely loses its focus . Its perfectly sequenced, in a way records were in the old days. ""let down""s twinkling 12 strings and oppressive melancholy and ""luckys"" soaring stadium downer rock are 2 of the finest moments in the bands catalogue. ""climbing up the walls"" doomy paranoia on the other hand would give tricky nightmares. The bands confidence is quite staggering, they KNOW they are brilliant.\n\nOnly the flat out rock of ""electioneering"" feels a little forced ,otherwise ""ok computer"" is one of those rare albums that fitted the times perfectly , capturing the hollow sadness at the core of our modern technology based, materialistic driven existance perfectly and it catapulted the band to a new level of fame .

RWHN,"['This is an undeniably spectacular album. Certainly the ""Dark Side"" of the 90s generation. Like ""Dark Side"", this album manages to channel a simple melancholic vibe that seemingly serves as a commentary on existence as defined by the times. ""Dark Side"" was steeped in the context of crass consumerism and the rise of the ""me"" generation. OK Computer is steeped in the rise of crass technologism and the rise of the ""look at me"" generation.\n\nLike ""Dark Side"" it is one of those albums you don\'t just listen to, it\'s an album you experience. The sonicry seems to take on an extra dimension, and it as though it is being absorbed by all of your senses. It is music that seeks out total immersion.\n\nI will say, OK Computer doesn\'t really call for me, personally, as much as Dark Side still does. OK Computer seems to have just a bit of cold detachment to it and just isn\'t quite as universal in feeling as Dark Side. There is the other issue that Radiohead, for me, kind of went off the rails after this album, and rightly or wrongly, it has sullied my desire to listen to anything Radiohead, even this marvelous album.\n\nHowever, that all aside, objectively speaking, there can be no doubt that this is a 5-star album that deserves its place in rock history and esteem. As of this writing it is #1 on RYM just ahead of Dark Side. I of course would flip the two, but I can agree with it being in that neighborhood. It honestly is probably the last great rock album that was ever written. Which honestly is quite a sad commentary on the state of rock music in the 21st Century, but that\'s a discussion for another place and time.']",5.00 stars
Halvor,"['The top spot on RYM of this album is what caught my attention and got me started listening to Radiohead about nine months ago, so I\'m approaching this album fifteen years after it was released. This was not what I expected - it sounds a little like a more hip version of eighties Marillion. The first six songs on this are all great. The album does get a little weak in the middle - ""Fitter Happier"", ""Electioneering"" and ""Climbing Up the Walls"" aren\'t great and bring the album down just a bit. If push came to shove, I guess I would have to say I love the way this album ends - the last three songs are so amazingly good.\n\nIf you\'re thinking about getting this, you need to realize this has more of a prog feel than The Bends or their later albums, so although it clearly fits in with their nineties work, it\'s unique in Radiohead\'s catalogue. I love the guitars on this - after this release Radiohead would rarely use so much electric guitar in their music. Here you have two or three complementary guitar lines along with keyboards and bass and of course vocals and drums, so it\'s a very complex sound. The melodic content on this is just out of this world. This is very depressing, too which I also like.']",5.00 stars

The author of these songs, in both content and delivery, shows that he not only knows the value of nothing, but he doesn't know the cost either.

""Paranoid Android"" is hands down the best song ever written. Pace-changing, unforgettable and just completely emotionally overwhelming. That\'s how most of the album works, it just overwhelms with feelings that once you\'re done with it, you will not know what hit you.

Average people are too often being mesmerized by the special effects of OK Computer, but if you were to remove these computer-generated sound effects, you’d see that there’s really not much to the album. The album opens with Air Bag. It starts with a computer-processed guitar droning made to sound “futuristic” in a cliché sort of way, but it ends up being a good song though. It then proceeds into Paranoid Android; probably the masterpiece of the whole album, with the exception of a few flaws. The “Rain down on me” ending segment of the song is touching, but it sounds a little conceited. Subterranean Homesick Alien is probably my favorite of the album. Its fascinating, with its lightshow display of sounds, it really captures that desire in all of us to be taken away from this boring world we live in, and explore extraordinary areas of the universe light-years away from here. But even still, it’s all studio trickery. If you were to disregard how distorted the sound is and examine the melodic structure of the song, you’d see there’s almost nothing to it. Radiohead always emphasized the effect of the sound over musical content. With the mournful Exit Music, we find Radiohead burying its nails deep into our subconscious. Anybody who has had a bastard father that they couldn’t bare to live with can relate to this song. Let Down was a nice song, with its influence of The Byrds’ jangle pop. However, the segment of computerized bleeps, bloops, and blops just sounds embarrassing to me. Karma Police has a very strong melodic piano progression, even if it is sort of a rip-off of Sexy Satie. This ends up being the last good song on the album, it’s all downhill after this. After listening to songs like Electioneering or No Surprises, you’re left wondering what the hell happened to this album. Similar to the album Ten by Pearl Jam: the first half of the album is great, but the second half is rather unsubstantial. In fairness, Ok Computer is a decent album. Even if it was, for the most part, a showcase of computer-generated effects; an emphasis on the emotional effect of sound instead of musical quality, it’s at least worth checking out. I still enjoy listening to it every now and then. But there are far more significant albums coming out of the 90’s, such as Loveless by My Bloody Valentine, Spiderland by Slint, and Well Oiled by Hash Jar Tempo. I’d consider those albums to be the essential masterpieces of that decade and were created by artists who are much more deserving of the word “innovative” than Radiohead was.']",

The album simply archiever in so many ways, but more importantly it sounds fresh and really enjoyable.

vaguelyhumanoid,"['For a while, there was sort of a dialectical progression of Radiohead albums. Up until Kid A each album by the group was both a fulfillment of the last album and a departure from it, displaying a consistent progression towards greater experimentation with non-rock styles of music. This is still distinctly a rock album, unlike the nigh-unclassifiable atmospheric experimentation of Kid A. However, it is also the first album that displays the sound now associated with the group: there were albums by Radiohead before it, but this was the first ""Radiohead album"".\n\nAside from its significance as a turning point in Radiohead\'s sound, it is musically amazing and my favorite Radiohead album. The main instrument, as with their previous two albums is the guitar, which conjures up an admirable range of tones from the simple, somber acoustic strumming of Exit Music to the distorted aggression of Paranoid Android and the clean, chiming lyricism of Let Down. However, the often guitar-oriented sound is augmented with a wide variety of melodies and textures ranging from strings and glockenspiel (?) to cut up, processed drum loops and electronic effects. The songwriting itself is brilliant, varying sharply in mood while consistently conveying the alienation of modern consumer society - this album deals with sociopolitical topics to a greater extent then probably any other Radiohead album barring Hail to the Thief.\n\nUltimately, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. I could write an entire essay, perhaps a book, about it, but in brief, I\'d say that it is an unparalleled musical experience and perhaps the best rock album I\'ve ever heard. I\'d recommend it to anyone who appreciates emotionally powerful, politically aware music with a wide variety of guitar textures and an experimental touch.']",5.00 stars

Ok Computer is an extraordinary journey, and every song works perfectly, from the crazy experimental interlude ""fitter Happier"" to the absolutely mind blowing ""Paranoid Android"".\nThere are very few conventional songs with simply a verse chorus verse chorus formation. They all build up, change in tone, there\'s optimism and despair, nothing is boring and everything is exciting. In ""Lucky"" the lyrics are full of hope but the music tells an entirely different story! There is something interesting to say about every song.\nSome of the highlights: that incredible crescendo in ""Exit Music (For a Film)"", Thom Yorke singing over himself in both ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Let Down"", the lyrics in ""Karma Police"" and the psychodelic ending, the equally psychodelic uncontrolled sounding ""Climbing Up the Walls"" and finally just the sheer beauty of ""No Surprises""!']",5.00 stars

It\'s rated highly though because it\'s an artistic album that can appeal to many different people who can appreciate artistic qualities of many different genres.

I\'ve given this album over 10 forced listens and granted, while it is agonizing at first it got less painful the most I listened to it. The problem is Thom Yourke\'s whiny singing voice that sounds like a cat\'s being tortured. And he sings like that on every track and doesn\'t mix it up, making the entire album sound the same in that regard. For those of you familiar with Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (a vastly superior album) imagine if Billy Corgan sang the entire album like he did on ""Here Is No Why"". Or ""To Forgive"". Or ""Bodies"". Or ""Stumbleine."" It wouldn\'t sound nearly as good. Granted, ""Paranoid Android"" is an outstanding song and ""Karma Police"" is good too, but by the time you get to the latter you\'re just tired of that whiny singing. The rest of the tracks kind of describe my feelings of the album: ""Let Down"" is what I think this album is, ""No Surprises"" is what it gives you in the singing style, and ""Lucky"" is what you\'ll be if you can make it through a listen without gouging you\'re ears out.\n\nBest Tracks: ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Karma Police"".\n\nWorst Tracks: Pretty much the rest.\n\nOverall: Proceed with caution.

Then I bet that people would rate it so highly that it would reach the Top 100 on this site.""\n\nThat was my initial review from March 10, 2010. Right now it is June 29, 2011, 3:25AM EST as I type this. There is a good chance that whoever it is spending their time to read this knows next to nothing about me. I appreciate you sticking around this long after such a lazy critique. Now onto the review:\n\nMy skepticism of Radiohead began in 10th grade. It was not so much the music, rather the people that I knew who listened to them. Among them were two people that I despise to this day. My scorn for one is barely justified, but I digress...I tend to hate the bands of a person that I dislike. However, Radiohead was not just any band to place such hate upon. Want proof? The 4chan-quality review up top was just a review since I felt wrong giving this album - one of such high praise and love - a low rating. Even back then I knew that everything about this band would intrigue me if I just gave them a chance. Instead, for the longest time I\'d only hear snippets of songs, see an occasional video, and just go on rants with friends about Thom Yorke\'s voice. However, I was lying to myself.\n\nApproaching two weeks ago, I decided to give Radiohead a real, honest-to-goodness listen. I\'d like to thank oldguywithsticks92, Björk (they\'re like cousins, musically, and I LOVE Björk), and of course Pathmark for having the album among their assortment for a fine $7 deal. A wise investment in retrospect. During the purchasing process, I was ashamed of what I was doing. I was embarrassed. Here\'s an album that I said that I\'d never buy from a band whom I hated and yet here I am buying it! I hid the disc in the cart upside down and between two other things just to disguise it. Once I came home, I gave the album a listen. I was doing a few things at once and even just left while the song was playing, and to No Surprise, it didn\'t stick.\n\nThat night I got no sleep, for the first time ever. Instead I just laid down on the bed and played OKC on the stereo; an old ritual of mine that I recently revived. Even though I had gone the longest time in my life without sleep, the music swept me through an onslaught of its sonic textures, fragile falsetto vocals, and consistent invention. <-Last one is a LIE!\n\nUnlike many first time listeners, I was well aware of the musicians that inspired Radiohead, I\'m even a fan of a good portion of the ones that really inspired this album (namely DJ Shadow, Charles Mingus, etc.). Much of this stuff was likely not as fresh to me as someone who was less versed in electronica and 90s underground music (as snobbish as that sounds) in general, and yet, the way this album uses atmosphere just seems to create memories for many of the listeners - yo. 1997 was Hell for me but this album makes it sound so beautiful that I don\'t even care about my silly personal history. It\'s not so much the sounds, rather the way that they were used in sharp contrast to much of the popular music at the time.\n\nThe smart ass talk ends here, instead I\'ve got unfiltered opinions!:\n\nThis is a fine album. I like every song. I think the order is perfect. Even if you are not the biggest fan of the inclusion of ""Fitter Happier,"" I appreciate how they added one song to try to break the barrage of classics, and yet this defect goes unnoticed (at least by me anyway).\n\n""Paranoid Android"" has the most ridiculous line ever.\n\n""Karma Police"" > ""Paranoid Android"" as a result.\n\n""Climbing Up the Walls"" is my favourite song.\n\n--I spent a few minutes making fun of every song while I was still skeptical, here\'s a few samples:\n\n""Paranoid Android"" - Oooh, they found a word that rhymed with paranoid!\n\n""Exit Music (For a Film)"" - Exit music? It\'s only the 4th track. Are they saying to stop listening now?\n\n""Let Down"" - Good thing I took their advice to leave when I did.\n\n""Fitter Happier"" - I used to be until I bought this...\n\n""No Surprises"" - Got that right, I\'ve heard this all before.\n\n""Lucky"" - They\'re lucky I bought this piece of *** ** * * ** * * ** * * * * * * ***\n\n----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n\nI understand the Radiohead formula now. Radiohead tends to take (at least back in the day) the underground music of the time (i.e. ambient, IDM, etc.) and mix it with their own blend of the popular style at the time (i.e. Britpop). The way that Thom defiantly uses his falsetto in contrast to much of the more grizzly contemporaries reminded me quite a lot of Curtis Mayfield. Ironically (hipster\'s favourite humour and yes I like the letter u), the electronics on this album sound quite basic and /dare I say it/ conventional. Luckily, often times this is not the case. They use the electronica-stylings sparingly and even the most simple effects are pulled off quite convincingly (refer to the climax of ""Karma Police""). This is where its successor, Kid A, differs. Radiohead moved on from being a rock band with underground yearnings to a collective that attempted to alienate their listeners and become the underground. Kid A was a great impersonation, and I mean that in the most endearing sense possible, yet it came out in 2000, practically at the end of the classic electronica period. That album features the band much more immersed in the music that they only sample here and yet, I think I still prefer this album. Hear me out, they\'re both splendid albums. It\'s just that this album sounds almost like its own genre with its not-too-complex-yet-complex-enough lyrics and the music itself whereas Kid A sounds more recognizable. I seem to feel the opposite in that regard compared to many of the other reviews that I\'ve read on here but if you were to listen to say Aphex Twin or Autechre, it would sound just as strange (perhaps even more so considering they were making the music much earlier than 2000). Point is, I like this band and album very much and I am sorry for writing my initial review without properly listening.\n\n[BTW THIS IS A ROUGH DRAFT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.]']",

The album itself is excellent for breaking new ground in a rather stagnant rock crowd that was befalling the genre in the early and later part of the decade, but in all honesty, there is something about it that always leaves a stale taste in my mouth whenever I re-listen to it. It is a cold, metallic, almost lifeless construct of chords and chorus structures. It just feels so artificial, despite how progressive it actual is for an alternative rock album.\n\nI always liken it to The Dark Side of the Moon if it was made in the 90\'s, and had its cynical edge turned up and a touch of 80\'s IDM/punk like aesthetic thrown in.

There is nothing quite like it and there wont be again, but at the same time it sounds so tired a dull, I just......I cant call it a classic. It is dripping with the whole corporate/self pittying Malaise that the 90\'s seemed to bring out in everyone, from musicians to hollywood, it does it though in such a way that really does put you out of sorts (at least for me anyway).

Its melancholic and malaise ridden theme makes it an absolute drudge to get through. Playing the album through must have been one of the most depressing exsperiences Ive ever had. In that regard though, it deserves some merrit.\n\nTrack pics: Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music (For a Film), Let Down, Karma Police, No Surprises.']",3.50 stars
40footwolf,"['I went from thinking OK Computer was just “pretty good” to believing that it is a masterpiece after my most recent listen. And I think it’s because I finally understand what this album is about: definition. Being defined by things that you never consider to have very much power over you but ultimately consume you and come to be your signature. Your politics, your taste in music, your neuroses, your love life…everything that you think is a choice but isn’t, not really. It’s 53 minutes of describing what happens when your Facebook Likes start controlling you and you begin to censor yourself at the behest of unknown enemies, people you do not know but whose names you curse and snarl at with all your heart. If only they would show themselves.\n\n“If only,” I think, being the phrase that most describes the general tone of the album. It kind of stuns me that this album is considered by so many people to be the greatest album of all time; not because it’s necessarily undeserving, but because I had no idea so many people would be able to identify with this kind of self-loathing. Because if there’s one thing OK Computer shows it’s that you can never hate anything more than that which is fully intangible.']",5.00 stars
CliffordthebigRedCat,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'When sitting down to review OK Computer, I really had to think about what I wanted to say. Everything that could ever be said about this album has been said a hundred thousand times more eloquently and effectively than I ever could. But then again, if you are affected by a piece of music, more specifically, a piece of art, why should you not feel entitled to express your thoughts about that art? The thing about OK Computer, it\'s such a seminal beast in the face of influential and emotional music that it\'s hard to sum up in a mere review...so I\'m going to do my best. There is a reason, after all, that this is the number one ranked album of all time on Rate Your Music\'s chart. Without further ado, I give you my thoughts.\n\nI was born in the nineties, right when Radiohead was first becoming the huge, international success that they would soon be known as, and the legend that their name holds in the industry these days. So, yeah, I was only about three years old when OK Computer was released. I wasn\'t there to hear it for the first time like so many others. I wasn\'t there to slide the audio cassette of OK Computer into my car\'s cassette player and slowly let my jaw drop as the tidal waves of ambience would so inevitably slide into the ears of millions and infect their musical tastes...and their ideas of music as an art form. With that being said, I grew up enjoying a wide variety of music, and slowly and assuredly, my musical tastes expanded like so many others had. I had my years of discovery where I stumbled (ala the Linkin Park and Disturbed days), but eventually, my ears sought to discover the world beyond the close encapsulated walls of radio rock music...there was something so cliché and worn out about much of the music that those stations played that I remember my father drumming along in the car to in my youth. I was a child born of circumstance...and eventually I broke those boundaries and ventured far into the progressive fields of unconventional music. I think the first step I made towards true self-discovery of my actual tastes and of creative, artistic music was with Nirvana\'s Nevermind. The moment I heard the rawness of those guitars and Kurt Cobain\'s shattered screams and yells...I was captivated. Through the years I gained a foot in the vast array of independent and progressive music that I had so often seen, heard, or glanced it on the internet. And like many circumstantial children of 90\'s radio rock, I first heard of Radiohead with their commercial success, Creep. Even though that song was far from what Radiohead truly was, and what I had no idea they would come to mean to me later in life, I adored it.\n\nThen through the years, I downloaded The Bends, Kid A, and OK Computer. Initially, because Rolling Stone magazine had named Kid A as their album of the decade...you see where I was coming from now?\nWith Kid A, I never truly understood the hype. I thought it was, yet another overrated, overhyped, overindulgent piece of drivel that this music industry seemed to deem art. Then again, I was only thirteen at the time. But unlike many a peer my age, I wasn\'t one of the thirteen year olds obsessed with billboard, bubblegum pop, or marketed cheap sounding hip-hop. Bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins helped begin the expansion of my tastes at an early age.\n\nIt actually wasn\'t until a couple of years ago that I was actually genuinely affected by OK Computer. I had enjoyed songs like, Karma Police, Paranoid Android, and even No Surprises to a certain extent. This was before I re-listened to the album to understand its revery and honor in the music world. But upon re-listening to the album for the first time since I downloaded it at the age of thirteen, I noticed something. The songs all did seem to carry a cohesive place together. They all seemed to flow into one another. Each song was incredibly unique and distinct. I was a little baffled that I hadn\'t noticed this before.\nSo, after I listened to it for the first time, out of sheer curiosity and infatuation, I listened to the entire album immediately after having just finished doing so. This time...it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. As if I had some sort of sudden epiphany and realization of what I was actually listening to. I think the moment that I had this sudden realization was when Thom Yorke goes into that beautiful falsetto on Exit Music (For A Film). I realized it was the most beautiful piece of music I had ever heard. I was giddy, like a kid in a candy store with unlimited funds. I felt like I could literally reach and out and touch this music physically with my hands. It had such a body to it, such a heart, such a soul. It was profound and completely enthralling. For the remainder of that listen, I was glued to my computer, with my headphones a harbinger of lush noises and sounds bouncing around one another in some odd, genius perfection. I loved how the band worked together as a cohesive unit, allowing each and every member to compliment one another...allowing each and every member their own moments of recognition. I loved the sweeping melodies and incredible arrangements. Immediately after I had finished listening, I looked up the song lyrics for the album and discovered how deep and meaningful they all were...and how these song lyrics that inhabited each song on the album, all tied together with one another on the album to create, more or less, a story of isolation and alienation, of despondence and frustration, of disintegration and decay of society, but also, of beauty, romanticism, and love of small facets of the world around.\n\nAfter I had finished that listen of OK Computer in deep analyzation and contemplation, I understood it. I \'got it\'. The album, the music, and its deep, intrinsic meanings hit me like a slug to the chest. My world was changed. OK Computer, in that moment, was both life changing and life affirming. It was everything that my tastes had been searching for in an album for so long, but had not the slightest clue...and it was right in front of my eyes for the longest time.\n\nI discovered that OK Computer\'s inception was based upon a deepseated disinterest and disarray from the society around it. It was an album that saw the future ahead of it, and bore it like a cataclysmic foreshadowing of sound and destructive emotion. It was kind of like reading Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury for the first time. It just kind of changes you. It enlightens you. It opens your eyes. It shows you how frail and shallow almost everything around you is, and how every day the society that everyone seemingly praises, is collapsing upon its own self indulgence. I guess I knew that before OK Computer came into my life, but then again, everything just clicked thrice-fold in my brain after having fell in love with this incredible creation.\n\nIt was an album about insightful, introspective, and analytical people who could see the rampant problems in society, hiding behind the thin veil of plastic smiles and radiant faces. Plastic surgery, public transport, the ideas of love in modern society, the fakeness and shallow nature of much of everything around it, the strive for progression in technology that was and is slowly tearing society apart on its own seems. These are many of the themes of OK Computer.\nAs society strives towards perfecting technology and using its beneficiaries to its advantage, it fails to see itself losing its own fragile humanity in the centerfold. And I think that that is much of what OK Computer is about, as a musical expression, and a social statement. It beckons for a return to real, raw, genuine, emotional, human qualities and aspects in society. And then you have parts of the album that entail the inevitable descent into paranoia and even further to insanity, due to the broken plastic shell that civilization brings on with its lucrative focus on advancement and security, rather than maintaining actual human morals and characteristics.\n\nI think the album has a lot of commentary on the idea of the ""android"". And more or less, I believe Radiohead placed the idea of an ""android"", or ""robot"" into the album so often because it is nothing less than the epitome of everyone that the society in which Radiohead illustrates are headed to become. ""I\'m paranoid, but I\'m not an android"", is a perfect example. And maybe, with a bit of a subjective analyzation, this is pointing towards the idea of human beings that are so obsessed with this dangerous idea of technology, that they are slowly turning into these androids, controlled by the technology they once sought to use to their benefit. So maybe, in the end, the message of a song so epic as ""Paranoid Android"", is perhaps its better to be paranoid than to let oneself disintegrate and formulate in the cogs of society\'s machinery, and let oneself become nothing less of an android. The fragile humanity that Radiohead so endearingly brings to life, are a bunch that believe they are free with all of their advancements in civilization and technology and culture, yet they fail to see that it is all a frail mask brought on by the \'society\' that is controlling their every action. Sound familiar? Well, Radiohead could see the future coming from a million miles away, and so, they set about using that very destructive technology that they despised so dearly, to create this masterpiece that we have today. They wanted to show their listeners, and perhaps, non-listeners that the freedom everyone held so highly was a blight that was ever-so-steadily playing with fire.\n\nEven more than that, I think that OK Computer places a lot of emphasis on a sort of unsatisfied and insightful character...one who sees through all the thin plastic veils of indulgence. I think that the character Radiohead are trying to convey, with their lyrical depth and their musical tone, is someone deeply isolated and alienated from everything and everyone around. He or she is a person that, against the wishes of society, chooses to maintain their humanity in a time of fleeting values and character. This is where the album becomes not just a prophetic siren song for the future (the ensuing 21st Century at the time of this record\'s release), but also an incredibly relatable, emotional, personal, and intimate summary of someone who feels deep dissatisfaction in their lives. Someone who is shattered and broken by their peers and by their environment. Someone who is desperately vying to break free from that place of anguish. And I think that is an incredibly relatable theme for many people. It\'s as if Radiohead have this vision of a Bruce Springsteen Born To Run type character, only set in a futuristic society, in a different time and place. I think the album has a lot of commentary on that of introverts and lonely people. Wide-eyed, emotionally unstable subway sitters and public transport junkies, window starer types, that embody much of that same isolation and despondence that Radiohead seem to feel so intimately connected to. It allows for almost any type of person to access this album and find an immediate connection with it, even if they are unfamiliar or turned off by the thought of experimental rock layered with electronics.\n\nIt is an incredible motif, and Radiohead do an exceedingly brilliant job at conveying these messages with their even more brilliant musical production. The music itself on ""OK Computer"" should never be understated. This isn\'t just a beloved album because of its messages about society and its symptoms of isolation and hollowness. There are many other albums that have themes and messages much like OK Computer. No, what seemingly sets OK Computer apart from the other experimental artsy alternative groups in the genre, is their masterful attention to detail when it comes to their music and sounds.\n\nRadiohead are a band that are constantly evolving, a band that gets off to the thought of reinvention and challenging their fan base. And with that, their entire discography is a constant shift in sounds, tones, ideas, and experimenting. With their debut, Pablo Honey, they were met with very mediocre critical acclaim. Had they not strived for more and probed their inner-genius, then we might be looking back at a band famous for its one-hit-wonder. But instead of simply settling for second rate, Radiohead went on to produce The Bends, one of the best guitar rock and alternative-centric albums of the nineties. With that album, they blew heads away. Critics and fans alike were awe inspired that such a mundane band could go on to craft such a fantastic record. But they did.\n\nBut even after that, Radiohead weren\'t satisfied with sticking to one definitive sound and in a shallow way, capitalizing upon it like so many other derivative bands have done. Instead, they understood that to keep their music fresh, to keep their music original, and to become the influential, groundbreaking centerpiece of the music world that they are today; they knew that they had to explore new ideas of reinvention and progression. Taking cues from other critically acclaimed artists (The Beatles, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, DJ Shadow, Can, etc.) who had also understood that reinvention and unconventional deviations from the norm are key to progression and originality in music, the early ideas for their masterpiece, and eventually, the world\'s masterpiece began.\n\nSo, with OK Computer, an album that appeared at the helm of the nineties, (a decade already ruled in original, experimental music) all of the pieces lined up in perfect symmetry for once, almost as if they were to set to fall into such a circumstance. With all of these frustrations and angers, all of these feelings of isolation and despondence from this slowly dwindling society, they created an album that would go down in history as legend because of all of that existential angst and crisis. Thom Yorke\'s howling vocals and beautiful range showcase the album\'s voice. It is a voice of desperation and disappointment, but also a voice drenched in fear and uncertainty of what the future was set to hold. With all of these emotions and all of this artistic vision, Thom Yorke perfectly inclines with the beautiful instrumentation at hand.\n\nSpeaking of the beautiful instrumentation, that may just be the album\'s defining characteristic. Because, behind all of its deep, intellectual and introspective themes and ideas, behind all of its layers and cacaphonies; there is one thing that OK Computer is heralded for more than anything else. And that is its incredible influence on music as a whole. Perhaps, an album that was released perfectly for its place in the genre. It came trodding along right as britpop was coming to its mighty end, and bands like Pulp, Oasis, and Blur weren\'t producing the same quality records that they once had. It came upon in a time of great musical change, both in stylistic approach and in purpose.\n\nAs it was released in 1997, the musicality that shines through on OK Computer was like nothing anyone in the music world had ever heard, nor had dreamed could ever work together in an album. The boys who had once released the infamous, ""Creep"" song, had no less than redefined a genre of music listeners and music creators in that same decade. Even today, OK Computer\'s influence can be seen far and wide in the industry. Bands like Coldplay, Keane, and Muse owe the entirety of their sound to Radiohead. Believe it or not, back in the day, alternative music didn\'t automatically include the use of electronics and synths. This is mainly due to the fact that Radiohead had a vision of a different alternative music landscape, and so, with OK Computer they saw their biggest departure from the days of the \'guitar, drums, bass, repeat\' cycle. And while that cycle in alternative and rock music is timeless and has always been seminal and most likely, always will be, Radiohead\'s sheer inventive force and insightful originality in their use of electronics working with those classic instruments was spellbinding and awe-inspiring for the music world. Little things like this all accumulate to make OK Computer the master class of musicianship that it is.\n\nAnd that\'s without even going into deep detail about Johnny Greenwood\'s redefining use of the guitar in alternative music, as he creates electronic and synth effects with his sharp skill and honed ability. Their sharp and forward thinking use of electronics in tandem with guitar rock helped light a fuse that had just been sparked before by other artists. This fuse exploded and fully took flight in the 21st century. In many ways, there were a lot of great albums that take direct creative inspiration and design from OK Computer, but then again, there is a pile brimming with deplorable ones as well. Nevertheless, one cannot argue the influence that this album has had on modern music. The funny thing is...if asked about how they would be viewed in ten years time before the release of OK Computer, I\'m quite positive that Radiohead would have never guessed, nor could they foresee how encompassing and legendary their names would go down in music history.\n\nLastly, the songs themselves on OK Computer...well they\'re something else aren\'t they? Each and every last song is notable on its own merits, as each one is entirely unique. No one song sounds alike to any other song, yet they all seem to flow into one another in perfect harmony, like the soundtrack to the collapse of a futuristic society...a society that Radiohead brings to life that feels not too far off might I add.\n\nWith each and every song, there\'s a hundred thousand different sounds, and the attention to detail is easily conceivable when you play the record for the fourteenth time and are still noticing slight details in the songs. From ""Airbag"", the opener, which is perhaps one of Radiohead\'s finest songs on its own merits. The guitar that opens the album is simply jaw dropping and brings a smile to my face. While the lyrics, which are intern much darker by all means. ""I am an interstellar burst. I am back to save the universe."" A lot of Radiohead\'s music has certain ambiguous qualities to it (a.k.a Kid A), but there\'s just something about that line that makes me shiver every time I hear it. It\'s almost like a siren song, a mission statement for the album, to me. As if the music at hand is actually larger than life, and is in place to provide a warning and a calling card all the same, for the album.\n\nI won\'t talk about each and every song in detail, since this review is already much too long, and I\'ve already exhausted expunging my passion and love for this record to the grave. But as the album continues, you have ""Paranoid Android"", which is ALMOST, the song of the album. It\'s a song that fully summarizes this album, or at least I think so. It has been called, by many, as Radiohead\'s ""Stairway To Heaven"". That\'s a statement that I completely disprove, considering ""Paranoid Android"" is a song that is leagues ahead of anything Led Zeppelin ever created. Yet, I can see why some people would believe that. It has this incredible bending of tempos and structures throughout, and all throughout I believe it details the slow descent into paranoia due to society\'s urgencies and pressures. It\'s a song about how that paranoia may be more freeing than falling victim to the cycle of conformity that the \'androids\' are so inclined to. Tracks like, ""Exit Music (For A Film)"" (which is apparently a song about Romeo and Juliet), prove that Radiohead has the ability to craft some of the most haunting music you\'ll ever hear. As it begins slowly and softly and foreshadows something much grimmer, it pulls you in, only to throw you for a loop towards the end where ""all hell breaks loose"". Then you have, ""Let Down"". This is my favorite track on the album. It\'s just simply perfect. It\'s one of the most beautiful expressions of disdain and despondence that I have ever heard, as we hear Thom serenade some of his most tasteful vocals ever over a story of ""transport, motorways, and tramlines"", and in the end, how disappointing and depressing it all is. Then you have fan favorites such as, ""Karma Police"" (a haunting tale of censorship and restriction), ""Climbing Up The Walls"" (a headfirst nosedive into a frighteningly realistic take on insanity), ""No Surprises"" (a song about the dissatisfaction of day job life and its pressures, as well as a testimony about the fake nature of many people in society due to the place of plastic surgery and cosmetics erasing our humanity), and then of course, there\'s, ""Fitter, Happier"", a song that I believe to be criminally underrated. While, yes, it isn\'t a full-fletched song like the others on the album, I believe that the song plays its part perfectly. Voiced by an android like character that carries a very unsettling nature, ""Fitter, Happier"" is more or less a reading of day to day normalities and pressures of modern society, and how they all more or less, tie together to unhinge one\'s humanity and turn them into the very android that narrates this unsettling monologue.\n\nOverall, I really can\'t think of a short summary for OK Computer. Because it is an album that deserves so much more than a few words. It\'s an album that deserves to be praised more and more with every passing year as its sheer influence can be seen far and wide. It\'s also an album that through all the beautiful instrumentation and innovative use of production, has so very much to say. About the modern world, about society, about the dangers of technology, about humanity, morality, love, censorship, and further existentialist ideas and thoughts. It\'s simply the most perfect album that I\'ve ever heard. I know that it\'s an undying cliché to say this, but OK Computer is my favorite album of all time, like so many other people. But in this case, this is a cliché that works. It\'s because this album is that damned good. It\'s so well thought out, well made and executed, that for anyone to say that it\'s their favorite album ever made...they have ever right. Music owes a lot to Radiohead. And so do I, as this album opened my eyes like I had never seen before to the bouquets of genres and styles of music at my access. So just for that, I\'d like to thank Radiohead...if not for anything else to begin with. No one ever anticipated that in the late nineties, the guys who put out ""Creep"", would go on to produce one of the most widely regarded and critically acclaimed albums ever created...but they did. I don\'t know if they\'ll ever top it, but who knows. It just goes to show, that the best things in life truly are not predictable.']",5.00 stars

Ughughugh,"['The most popular album ever. Not just is this the most popular album on RYM, but it\'s the one that\'s always coming on top of TV/radio/magazine polls.

I\'m not a big Radiohead fan, but I don\'t rate this as really shit compared to their other stuff, which is where I feel I stand out. In fact, I\'d say this is average or so.\n\nOne of the problems I have with it is how much I\'ve listened to it. I put it onto my mp3 player and PC years ago, when I only had a few thousand songs, and the tracks came up on shuffle so often. I really couldn\'t help but sicken myself of it. Most music probably would become a bit dull after so many listens, although certainly not all, and I can think of a good number of records I had at that time which I never became bored with and still hold as very dear to me. In other words, not being sick of this album would not increase my rating. I\'ve been as objective as possible here!\n\nTracks like Paranoid Android, Exit Music and Karma police, regardless of what I\'ve just said, will probably never bore me. But not much else has such resistance to over-listening.\n\nI suppose the lesson you can take from OK Computer is that it shows you the bad and the good of what Radiohead are. There are some really beautiful moments in the aforementioned tracks, but there are also some really dull, dreary moments. Of course, even in the best moments, it\'s pretty easy to become more than a little melancholic. Exit Music is about the worst for this. I cannot listen to it without feeling my soul being torn apart just a little.\n\nFact: I\'ve never listened to this album in the correct order. I put it onto my computer years ago (the CD is my father\'s), but for some reason it ended up in m4a format, and when I converted to mp3 I had lost the encoding on the files, thus the track numbers were all set as ""1"". I could, of course, have sorted it, but I\'m really not that anal.

Best song in the world, also. Short and sweet, lyrics are excellent. Happy music coupled with dark, violent lyrics.\n\nLucky- 7/10\nBorrows much from Pink Floyd. Showcases Jonny\'s guitar work.\n\nThe Tourist- 9/10\nGreat ender. Has a jazzy feel to it, possibly because the writer of this song is Jonny Greenwood who really likes jazz. Reminds me of Kid A\'s jazzy songs like How to Disappear Compleatly and National Anthem.']",

I get this feeling about them now like I do the Velvet Underground and Wu Tang Clan - I feel like I ""get it"" now, but eventually, I\'ll mature musically and fade out of it. Well, for those of you that haven\'t enjoyed a psychedelic experience, it often tends to cleanse my doors of perception, so to speak, and completely eliminates the pre-concieved notions temporarily that make up our conscious and subconscious judgements. During an experience such as above stated, I put on my Kid A 10 inch LP and it clicked...again. This time, it clicked that these guys may make decent popish- art rockish- stuff, to me, similar to Beatles and Pink Floyd (and other brilliant modern British pop performers in the realms near, but below them), but they haven\'t PIONEERED it. Ya know? It\'s good, but I don\'t feel it\'s groundbreaking like their forefathers. Not that this is Radiohead\'s fault.. you don\'t choose when you\'re born. Who knows?

rejeanne,"[""IT'S OK Computer !!\n\nNot one of the Radiohead following legions did a very good job ripping off this album, because for all of its echoes you hear in alternative rock of the 2000s, it still sounds completely unique, completely fresh. This is a record where the thinking wasn't done outside of the box, THIS is a record where the box was fed to a COW, and the cow's milk tasted like cardboard afterwards so little Jimmy poured it down the drain, which went into a garburator, which fed then into the city water supply, causing the sewers to EXPLODE. YEAHHH.\n\nThe songs in themselves are all great, it's technically brilliant, full of electronic strands waiting to be discovered. The first track, Airbag, is about a man surviving a car crash, or easily any near-death situation, and taking on a new view on life because of it; it's just as excitable as it sounds. Of course famous Paranoid Android follows, the six minute epic that simply must be heard to be believed. Subterranean Homesick Alien is a nice breather, a throughly reverberated daydream. The album flows nicely through to the next two songs, Exit Music and a soaring highlight, Let Down.\n\nThen we hit Karma Police, the album's centrepiece, and arguably one of Radiohead's crowning achievements, the only song that never fails to give me goosebumps with every listen. It has an impeccable buildup; the lyrics remind me of a feverish nightmare. In the first verses, people are being arrested for opaque reasons, up until the protagonist himself is prosecuted, frantically trying to save himself. Offering no closure, the song takes off in an unforgettable climax.\n\nIn Fitter Happier, we cross over into the darker half of the record. It's a computer reciting a list of positive attributes that could easily come from a self-help book, and if you pay attention it's appropriately disturbing. Electioneering is really Bends flavoured guitar rock as is sometimes suggested, one of the weaker tracks on the record but hardly a throwaway. Climbing Up the Walls is the last track before the album's downtempo ending stretch, a song written from the viewpoint of a murder or maybe a psychiatric patient, with distorted vocals and some gorgeous strings.\n\nNo Surprises is one of the only real 'modern alienation' tracks on OK Computer. It's the old story about a character with a throughly soul-draining life in the suburbs, with everything anyone would ever want but never really happy. It's not difficult to hear it as being about suicide, and the beautiful, soothing melody only ends up twisting the knife. One of the most affecting songs here.\n\nThe only real misstep here is at the very end. Lucky continues in the vein of No Surprises, but despite its optimistic lyrics it's a very sombre song - revealingly, it was recorded not long after The Bends. It would make a brilliant closer, but instead it follows with The Tourist, a ballad neither as heartrending as Lucky and No Surprises nor as simply <i>good</i> as Karma Police or Paranoid Android. It's not bad, but not very interesting either.\n\nBut that hardly seems to matter when so many great tracks come before. It's not quite the Modern Alienation album that you've probably heard it summed up as. But it's still great, and it's still relatable. And it's as relevant as it was the day it was released.\n\n<i>Please, could you stop the noise?</i>""]",5.00 stars

Dogs_Body,"[""There's little that can be said about Radiohead's OK Computer that hasn't already been said; apart from that fact that I prefer Kid A..... (2011 UPDATE: I'm not so sure now!?) Besides that, Rate Your Music's 'most owned album' is a progressive rock masterpiece which oddly enough has never really been considered 'prog'. This aside the unique blend which is 'Radiohead' is a pleasure to behold, and with the mega hits Paranoid Android, Karma Police and No Surprises the album could do no wrong (I openly admit to being a 'greatest hits junkie').\n\nThe odd little intermission track Fitter Happier is the albums only real weakness; at first I didn't mind this electronic voice preaching at me however several years on it has become more tolerable.

It's one of the album's shorter cuts, which helps it a lot. 3.5/5\nLucky - Though not offensive, overly repetitive and drawn out. 3/5\nThe Tourist - Back to the drawn out mopeyness, and without anything interesting in the music to take away from it. 2/5\n\nSo overall, a 3.5 which I'll bump to a 4 since the 0.5 was a filler interlude.

violetmasks,"['You know, I don\'t think many people have taken a step back and looked at this album, or Radiohead in general, and asked themsevles ""what is it about this band that I like?"" I feel like it\'s become this default notion that people who like alternative rock, art rock or generes similar to those, have to like Radiohead. They\'ve been around for a long time, are still making music, keep themselves out of the public eye and stick to their signature sound and style for the most part. Nearly everyone i\'ve talked to about Radiohead, says with confidence that this is their best ablum. With all due respect, I disagree. I actually think the album is overrated.\n\nI used to listen to Radiohead much more than I do now. As I got into other forms of music, and started making my own music, it kind of pushed me away from them a bit. I started thinking about each of their albums, and when it came to OK Computer, I realized that I only really listen to maybe 30% of the album. Airbag opens the album wonderfully, i\'ve always enjoyed it. Everyone knows Paranoid Android but I actually think this song could have been a lot better. I think the song is a bit too complex for it\'s own good. I think it should have been a slower song in general. Everything before the heavy breakdown should have been at a slower tempo, and the chorus could have been something different. I like the heavy breakdown, but after that, I almost never listen to it.\n\nSubterranean Homesick Alien has A LOT of potential, I think if it would have been an instrumental track, it would have been much better. Exit Music (For a Film) is a bit too somber and plain, but it holds it\'s place on the album more than others. I think if Thom Yorkes vocals on it would have been a bit lower, and with effects, it would have been better. Let Down had a lot of potential as well, but where they took the song with the drums and rhythms just doesn\'t grab me. A lot of the vocals on this album I just don\'t like enough.\n\nKarma Police is the first REAL standout track on the album. I wouldn\'t change anything about this song. I actually would have probably made this song longer, but isn\'t that a compliment? Fitter Happier is a take it or leave it song, purely filler but it has the lyrics that many Radiohead fans seem to like. Electioneering has a Pearl Jam feeling to it that I know many people like, but it\'s never been a good song to me. Climbing up the Walls should have been a strictly instrumentals song, MAYBE with faint vocals with lots of echo effects as the song picks up.\n\nNo Surprises is the second real standout track on the album. From the second it comes on, your attention is grabbed and you feel like you\'re on this little cloud. It has such a nice style to it; i\'ve always really enjoyed it. Lucky to me is too much Pink Floyd and it\'s never found it\'s way into me. It\'s not a bad song, but it\'s just not a song I enjoy. Thom Yorkes vocals have actually come to bother me in a way. They have this whining quality about them that seems to repeat itself. The Tourist is one of the stronger tracks on the album, but again, should have been without vocals. I would actually like to see a strictly instrumental album by Radiohead, I think that would be pretty amazing.\n\nAfter this album, Radiohead became more experimental and recorded what I think are better albums: Kid A and Amnesiac. For all the music they make, like Red Hot Chili Peppers and many other bands, how many of their songs do you really honestly listen to and enjoy?']",3.00 stars

Wir suchen einen Schlagzeuger, Glatze, weil Haarwuchs biologisch eingestellt, höchstens Ansätze von Fusselhaar, dabei kaum dreißig Jahre alt. 2.

Einen Wirrkopf mit ebenso wirrer Frisur für Gitarren und Tasten, unmögliche Körperhaltung, exzentrischer im kleinen Zeh als der Rest der Welt. 4. Noch einen Gitarristen, mindestens Schönling, weil Gene hier freundlich gesinnt, doch ebenso mindestens schüchterner Weggucker, introvertiert. 5. Den Frontmann: Niedergebrannte Robert-Smith-Rattenfrisur zwischen blond und hexenrot, ein Auge kaputt, linkisches Verhalten, unfreundlicher als der Sheriff von Nottingham, Weltenhasser. Die schickt man in die Welt, läßt sie Platten aufnehmen, Konzerte geben, Videos, etc. und badet derweil in der Kohle, die dieser Wanderzirkus der Skurrilität einspielt. Eigentlich unglaublich, aber wie sollte man den Erfolg der Band Radiohead ansonsten erklären. Vielleicht liegt es auch an der Qualität der Musik?\n\nDiese Scheibe beginnt so verhalten. Thom Yorke droht zärtlich: ""I\'m back to save the universe"", dazu rumpelt die Band einher in kurioser Rhythmik. Doch die Phil-Collins-Fans sind schon entgeistert. 30 Milliarden potentieller Kunden weltallweit verschreckt, huch. Und dennoch ist da dieser Aufkleber auf der Schachtel: ""No. 1 UK"". Gibt es dort keine Collins-Fans? Oder sind die dort in der Minderheit? Das UK: Heimstätte der Vernünftigen, dieser Schmelztiegel aus Römer, Kelten, Angeln, Jüten, Sachsen, Normannen, Jamaikanern, Pakistani, Indern, Skinheads, etc., wundervoll. Und Radiohead drehen weiter am Rad, jetzt gehen sie auf die Politik los, denn, wenn Thom Yorke, dem ungeborene Hühner im Hirn rumrasen, endlich Diktator ist, sind manche ihre Rübe los. Ah, endlich ist Robespierres Nachfolger in Sicht, die Rettung der Menschheit, heiligheilig. Sage keiner, daß dieser Wahnsinn keine Methode hätte, auch die schizophrene Bebilderung des CD-Booklets folgt einem stummen Pfad durchs Unterholz des Negativum. Und dunkler Regen fällt aus höchsten Höhen, zwischen massiver Gitarrenlärmerei, die meine Nerven salbeit und Panik, Kotze und, passend, Yuppiefressen. Gott liebt seine Kinder, heißt es. Ja, sagt SAT 1. Thom Yorke und Leo Kirch, Sohn und Vater. Doch das eher in der Tradition des Ödipus. Und zuschlagen würde er mit Sicherheit gerne, der Thom. In der Musik Radioheads liegt eine Aggression begraben, dort knapp unter der Oberfläche, welche die gesamte sogenannte Metalszenerie einschmelzen könnte. War eine Platte bereits einmal im wichtigsten Markt Europas an der Pole Position, auf der den Hörern nachgerufen wurde: ""Wir hoffen, daß Ihr Euch übergebt!"" So hört man es am Schluß des himmlischen ""exit music (for a film)"". Schimären, Spiegel, schwarze Magie! Das sind die Spielzeuge des Radioheads. Und je mehr die Platte voranschreitet, so gewinnt man das Gefühl, wird alles schlimmer, drastischer. Und die Musik, sie frißt dein Hirn! ""karma police"" erscheint eine Jamsession von Reinhard Mey mit den mittleren Beatles gewesen zu sein, gegen Ende erscheint dann Acid-König Syd und verteilt LSD à gogo, und die Musik hebt in bunte Farben ab, inklusive kunstvollem Feedback. Und die Worte? Das Mädel mit der Hitlerfrisur, die Thom Yorke völlig verrückt macht, dafür er ihre Party sprengt. ""this is what you get, when you mess with us"", klarer Fall, man hätte es wissen müssen. Aber, pfui, er hat sich nur einen Moment lang nicht im Griff gehabt. Zitat. Na, hier geht\'s ja dann ab, bei Zeus, dem mächtigen. Dazu spielt der Wirre das Klimperklavier, herzzerreißend. Drama, Tränen in meinen Augen. Nach dieser Platte können den berührten Hörer viele andere Musiken f...n, bis der S....z b....g ist. Oder anders rum. Manierismus allerorten, in allen Tönen, in einer Umsetzung, die in diesen Zeiten ihresgleichen sucht. Alles absolut gewollt und gerufen, hereinspaziert! Wo gibt\'s das sonst noch? Mansun? Ja, vielleicht. Weltekel ist auch nur ein Acht-Buchstaben-Wort.\n\nWut, Wut, Wut ist das Motto dieser Platte. Daß die Band während der Aufnahmen beinahe zerbrochen ist, nun, ist absolut kein Wunder. Das sie weitermachen schon eher. Und das diese Scheibe ein Hit wurde, erkläre ich mir nicht mehr mit Alchemie, sondern damit, daß Unmengen an CD-Käufern die reinsten tauben Nüsse sind, die für solch eine Platte meiner Meinung nach pro Exemplar einen lockeren Monatslohn auf den Tisch legen müßten, damit ihnen klar wird, mit welchen Produkten sie hantieren!

tyreesemj1,"[""radiohead's best album, and a good album indeed, but a bit overrated.\n\nthe album's good points defintely starts the really good songs it has (Airbag, Climbing up the Walls), especially paranoid android. what a song! crazy that they got it from the beatles' happiness is a warm gun, which by the way is a great song too. if you haven't listened to it, you should check it out. but back to paranoid android, if you don't like that song, you don't like rock. period. another big plus is that none of the songs suck (some'll say Fittier Happier sucks cuz it's technically not a song, but i feel it goes with the album in its own weird way). that's very rare to have an album where none of the songs suck. also, the flow of the album as a whole is pretty good, not on par with What's Going On and Sgt. Pepper's, but still good. the lyrics are some of the songs (electrioneering, no suprises) were interesting too. this album also sounds concentrated, meaning they had a vision for every song on the album and came up with the melodies etc. to match the visions they had for the songs, another plus. i personally am a fan of different types of music and like having different styles of music in my collection, and this album is very left-field. it has it's own style which i love.\n\nit has quite a few drawbacks, the main being while there are no whack songs, only Paranoid Android, Airbag, and Climbing up the Walls stand out, to the point that you forget that you listened to the other songs. some songs like electrioneering, no surprises, and subterranean homesick alien are pretty good, but they're no match for those 3 songs, which brings it to another drawback, the songs i said didn't stand out, almost all of them sound alike. i feel like i'm listening to a variation of the same song throughout the album with a few outliers along the way. 3rd, those songs are very boring as well. it has no hype to them, at all. mainly it's because the music (instrumental) have no substance. their music is good because of the relms it creates. you can see the music, but you can't feel it, and with that, those songs sound alike, and the fact that they are thinking beats and no rhythm beats, it only adds up to boredom. another big problem is the singer himself. another rock frontman who can't sing. he sounds like he whining the whole album. you know it's true, especially when you can't understand a word he's saying. that will make someone never listen to the album again. big turnoff. i had to look up the lyrics on the internet only to find most the lyrics don't make sense. ridiculous.\n\nas many flaws as it has, i can actually see why this album has a following. i can also see why many radiohead feel it's their best album (which it is), and i can also see why people like The Bends better. now Kid A, i don't know, but i can see The Bends. and as much as i said bad about this album, it's actually pretty good, but it's NOT for everyone, another reason to add why it's not the best album in the world.

Pepper's, Revolver, Led Zeppelin IV, and Loveless to name a few, it is still better than a lot of other rock albums. listen at your own risk.\n\nbest songs\nParanoid Android (their best song period, not just best album song)\nAirbag\nClimbing Up the Walls\nNo Surprises\nSubterranean Homesick Alien\n\nworst song\nFittier Happier""]",3.50 stars

Overarching themes of suburban malaise, alienation, and technology run amok in the most yawn inducing ways notwithstanding, this album is simply a collection of twelve incredible songs (yes, even the spoken word interlude of Fitter Happier, which compresses the above mentioned themes into two succinct minutes).\nIncessant touring and hectic recording schedules forced Radiohead to become quick learners at both, and all their talent and skill come out in songs like the multi-suite Paranoid Android, the slow-boiling Exit Music, and the U2-conquering Lucky.\nAn album that consistently rewards repeat listenings (sleigh bells in Airbag, white noise on Climbing Up the Walls, a gorgeous Jonny Greenwood solo at the end of The Tourist, Thom Yorke's singing on Let Down), OKC seems no less relevant and powerful twelve years after its release. Many of the songs were written on acoustic guitar and simply experimented upon in endless ways onstage and in the studio. It's a testament to the band's ability to be simple and complex at the same time, along with lyrics that are similarly ominous and ambiguous.\nThe backlash in some spheres is inevitable, but popular music (millions of copies sold worldwide) has never been this experimental, melodic, and - dare I say it - fun at the same time.""]",5.00 stars

This test paid off, and pushed me into a position of great respect for a band which I would have never bothered with otherwise.\nHaving owned 'The Bends' since my youth, I never expected this band would have released an album with such ambition as is revealed on 'OK Computer'; with each song, you can almost feel the will to experiment and grow.\n\nThe only low point of the album I can highlight is possibly Electioneering which is a little too vanilla indie-rock for my liking. Otherwise the whole album really does showcase Radiohead's yearning to expand their horizons in a very interesting way; Fitter Happier is apparently not a crowd pleaser and yet to me it is even further proof of this.\n\nTop picks of the album?

I can understand some people doesn't like it for being over-hyped (I guess that's the right term). I've been there in '97; there was too much hype for my taste, so I had some aversion towards it. I knew those (first) two singles, which were good, but I couldn't understand the fuss about the album. Then, a couple months later the radio show that was absent for almost a year was back on the air, and on the first show they played OK Computer. I was so thrilled the show was back and I recorded the album (minus few songs) on a cassette, and decided to try to listened to it to see is it any good (it couldn't do any harm). After I have listened to it a couple times (maybe around five), I've got that great feeling when you realize something good is going on, and OK Computer is beyond those two singles. With Subterranean Homesick Alien the album started to unfold while I started to enjoy it more and more. A month later I've found (burnt - so called Bulgarian) CD at the local store and bought it immediately, so I could enjoying it properly.\nNext year or so the album was on my Top 10 albums, but as the time has passing by, it started to be slightly less appealing. Large part of it was due to the overplaying it on my player. Since then (circa '99) I've been playing it significantly less than I used to, and album slowly departed my Top 10, and later also Top 66 albums.\nToday I'm listening to it rarely (once or twice a year), but every time when I'm listening to it, OK Computer reminds me how actually good this album is, and how I used to enjoying it.

To me, however, Radiohead\'s musical pinnacle doesn\'t sound steeped in a certain decade - twelve years later, it works as a great soundtrack to the noughties, as well, and most probably will continue to have a compelling effect on future generations.\n\nI first laid my ears on OK Computer in 2005, while being a foot deep in the middle of an appreciation period for old school progressive rock. Consequently, it was an odd record to listen to at first; not overwhelmingly weird or difficult, mind you, but...modern. I could hear traces of Pink Floyd, which I later found out was a common phenomenon among listeners. Still, for all the faint Pink Floyd vibes it most certainly wasn\'t art rock in the tried-and-tested 70s fashion. OK Computer clearly was a musical animal all on its own, drawing from influences, yes, but in the process creating that rare specimen of a record: a piece of work that will resonate across cultural barriers and through the ages.\n\nIt firmly drew me in, listen by listen. It wrapped me in its layered beats, in its eery and stirring yet strangely enticing soundscapes, mainly created by the rich and imaginative use of guitar textures and their juxtaposition with Thom Yorke\'s sweetly lamenting vocals. This music, seemingly depressing to many ears out there, was, and continues to be, one of the purest, most invigorating emotion-laden musical rides for me. At the risk of sounding like a silly fangirl, I will go so far as to say that my inner being seems to ebb and flow to the beat, melody and execution of these eleven, meticulously crafted songs (and no more so than during ""Exit Music"", ""Let Down"" and ""Lucky"") A \'chemical reaction\' if there ever was one...\n\nIn an attempt to crystallize the essence of one of the greatest records of our time, even further than our Pitchfork critic at the beginning of this review, I will only say this: OK Computer simply...is.']",5.00 stars

Um disco indefinível, inquestionável, é um resumo em doze faixas de (quase) todas as contribuições dadas pela banda inglesa ao rock mundial, o que também se traduz naquilo que foi copiado por milhares de grupos que tentavam recapturar parte da magia de um álbum único. É bem verdade que a primeira metade do disco é mais esmagadoramente impressionante do que a segunda (o que fica ainda mais evidente pelo fato de esta começar com uma dispensável faixa de falação que destaca os piores aspectos da tendência ‘artística’ da banda), incluindo uma das aberturas de disco mais fodas da história, com a linda Airbag e a épica Paranoid android declarando pra todo mundo que aqui estava o ápice da carreira dos caras. Provavelmente o maior mérito do disco é expandir o rock a limites antes impensados sem que a coisa parecesse forçada, calculada ou fria.

But even I notice this track now has a significant place and meaning on the album that can't be ignored. This is the perfect alienation/ paranoia of the future album, and once one gets in the appropriate mind set it can be damn near impossible to not be awed by it. Radiohead simply reinvented a genre of rock music that had almost been forgotten the world over, and even now in early 2009 its message of mistrusting technology is still relevant.

samwicks,"['This is one of my 5 favourite albums and is probably the defining work of the 90\'s. This albums is a piece of art in every way especially in the way that the uneducated ear cannot quite listen to the amazing complexity and beautiful singing of Thom Yorke.\nThe album starts where The Bends kind of is, rocky and anthemic but at the same time powerful and artistic with Airbag, also appearing on Airbag/How Is My Driving EP in a slightly different format. It then plunges into what is the unrelenting epic of Paranoid Android, possibly the best song on the album.\nIt then moves sound to a numb pace, with Subterranean Homesick Alien and Exit Music (For A Film), the latter having a haunting twist with Yorke singing ""we hope that you choke."" A far less ghostly but still as numb and beautiful track is Let Down.\nThe track Karma Police well deserves it\'s place as one of Radiohead\'s top singles, a brilliant song that shows electronic experimentation linking with archaic instrumentalism.\nThe neutrality of the song Fitter Happier eludes to the great genius of Radiohead. One of the final reposes of the anthemic side of Radiohead is shown in Electioneering a classic rock track in an a very 1990\'s form.\nClimbing Up the Walls is another one of those numb, strange and almost drugged tracks. It then leads to the most beautiful song on the album. Some say depressing others say strangely hopeful but it can be agreed it is certainly a lethargic track but nonetheless one of the most amazing songs of the 90\'s.\nThe mood swings once more to numbness and tiredness. But it can be seen that this time it seems more controlled. Lucky moves to one of those notorious Jonny Greenwood album finishing tracks. The Tourist is a smooth, beautiful song that has a truly intense feel']",5.00 stars
Canvasback,"['Considered possibly the most “important” album of the decade. But, besides all of that, I still liked it. I hold strong loyalties to their previous, “The Bends”, but, this was an incredible follow up, to say the least. Significant innovations in sound and concept from the start, with “Airbag” and it’s distorted drums and effects. Then the fantastically involved, “Paranoid Android”, became an instant classic Radiohead masterpiece, as it opens into Thom Yorke’s falsetto verse, over the beautifully unique, rhythmic atmosphere that this band is so great at, instantly screaming into heavy guitars, then sailing across an air of beautiful vocals, arriving onto a heavy handed closing. A couple of tracks later, is maybe the most emotional song the band has ever recorded. “Exit Music” is the most incredible portrayal of desperate escape, that, I’ve ever heard in music. It’s still an event that brings the world to a stand still, as it reaches a disturbing, heart-wrenching climax in the last section. And of course “Karma Police” is a statement from my own soul to the rest of the world, I must thank them for saying it so well. The next 3 tracks keep this from being a “perfect” album for me. The computer generated “Fitter Happier” goes on to long, “Electioneering” is a loud piece that has little direction, and the distorted vocal on “Climbing the Walls” spoils the mood set by the other tracks. But, then I love the final 3 tracks from the ironic “No Surprises”, the atmospheric “Lucky” and the appropriate closer “The Tourist”. It’s still tough to rate an album’s value even a decade away. But, I’ll agree on the landmark position this one is placed. If it was only more complete then I’d launch it to the heights, as well.']",4.50 stars

It's probably not the second greatest album of all time, but I honestly believe it's not far off. For years, too much weight has been put on the great classics of the 60s and 70s, and very often deservedly so, but nevertheless, we're all eager for a new wave of true masterpieces, and (with the help of MTV and numerous others) we just haven't seen that in the last 25 years or so. There have been a few great ones, some left field classics, but even the most balanced critics will agree that the output of amazing music is simply not as high as it once was, and there's defenitely not one reason for it, and we could be debating why forever. Radiohead and, in turn, OK Computer, did not start that new wave of masterpieces, but if one album SHOULD have in the last quarter of a century, it's this. I'm not going to summarize the music because it's been done so many times before - I will simply say that it's one of the greatest album efforts of all time and it's about time we see more of these.

I listened to this album the entire way through several times, because I really wanted to like it, and the only track I found even moderately entertaining was Karma Police, but even that just feels like it lacks substance. Pink Floyd makes the experimental/psychedelic concept album work because their riffs are memorable and their lyrics are worthy of singing in the shower. In other words, they're accessible. And while some people may criticize accessibility in a band, claiming that it means they're too mainstream or that they've sold out, I find it an absolute must have for me to appreciate a band. In essence, what Radiohead has done here is create an paradoxical album that's difficult to listen to but requires several full listens to comprehend.\n\nThe only reason I would ever listen to this album again is because of it's reputation - I feel like I'm missing something, but no matter how many times I listen to OK Computer, I never find it.\n\nTwo stars. Best track: Karma Police.""]",2.00 stars
Anders_Saints,"[""OK Computer creates an atmosphere between melancholy and anger that hits you in the depths of your feelings through their lyrics and melodies. Radiohead's guitars are full of feelings that instead of seem played by human beings, they seem played by aliens.\n\nThis could only be possible in the 90s.\n\nSince AIRBAG until THE TOURIST the album is a trip that reflects various themes; always searching out the depths of the heart.\n\nThom Yorke's voice is unique and in conjunction with all the instruments of the band and the album production stands out even more.\nIn addition, the booklet that accompanies the album is almost surreal.\n\nOK Computer born in an era of searching, the 90s was the era where rock had found new ways, especially with alternative rock. That decade between the Dance-Pop of the 80s and the Garage Rock Revival ‘n’ almost indie rock of the 2000s. This means that the alternative rock gets to the top and the award was won by OK Computer in 1997.\n\nAfter almost 20 years still it should keep that privilege, I hope, never be surpassed.""]",5.00 stars

Rocky_Sullivan,"[""I will probably catch some heat from my buddies for not rating this higher. I can appreciate the fact that OK Computer introduced me to a fresh and new direction of music when it came out. On most of the tracks, I find myself listening to the great interplay between the instruments. The music is definitely atypical. I love the tempo changes in some of the songs as well as the occasional dissonance.\nThe problem I have with Radiohead is the vocals. I don't find enough contrast in the vocal style, range, tempo,... to keep my attention. I understand that the sad bastard music Radiohead so often promotes needs Thom's voice to complete the music, but I don't like the lazy approach to singing so many alternative bands take. I sometimes get sick of the same slow style of their music.\nFor some reason, I do not like many of the 'popular' songs off this album. I do not particularly like Paranoid Android, but like Exit Music, The Tourist and Lucky. I can enjoy Radiohead in small doses but I would not recommend this album. Overrated? I don't know. I understand that it is a very popular album among many many people. However, I think Radiohead is not an elite band.

However I hadn't actually had breakfast yet so it may not have been the raising for my aching belly.\nI struggled to understand the lyrics, the style in which this guy sings really masks what he is trying to say.

Ytse_Ham,"['The atmosphere that emanates from this masterpiece is one of the most intricate dichotomies I\'ve encountered so far: depressing yet joyous. The lyrics are overwhelmingly negative, singing about computers consuming humanity, a narrator repeatedly hoping a character chokes, and overwhelmingly desolate loneliness. The music, however, is consuming and atmospheric, like a white cloud that hides reality and creates an alternate and intricate reality. The first dozens listens through this album last fall generally got me depressed, but nowadays, I find that it sometimes is uplifting, even though ""Exit Music"" is one of the saddest songs I\'ve heard in my life. The variety and flow really completes this album. ""Climbing up the Walls"" and ""Let Down"" convey two completely different emotions, an most of the songs fit right after another, with the exception of Electioneering, which breaks up the atmosphere, for better or for worse.']",4.50 stars

TopMelodic,"['First, a confession: ""OK Computer"" brought me back to Rock music. Deceived from the spontaneous death of Shoegazing (My Bloody Valentine and Stone Roses\'s new albums were not coming out; Lush and Curve couldn\'t produce a good first album; Chapterhouse, Ride, Happy Mondays, Slowdive, Catherine Wheel and many more were just brain dead), the end of The Pixies/Breeders, the boring supremacy of Grunge, etc. I met a friend who initiated me to Classical music and to the joys of listening to music on a perfoming hi-fi system (Try Tallis\' Spem in alium sang by Huelgas Ensemble!). Why Dead Can Dance when there is the real Middle Ages? Why Cocteau Twins if Classical divas have solid singing technique? Any Rock experiment was instantly tagged ""useless"" and ""already done better in Classical music"" by that new friend that I must thank because he still had opened my eyes to new kind of music, which was after all a crucial event in my life.\n\nThen, a revelation: So, I discovered ""OK Computer"" (everybody was talking about it and I was curious). The depressive ballads impressed me from the first listening. I even thought that Rock music had reached its age of maturity with Radiohead (!) and it took about 5 more years before Classical music left the place slowly but surely to its younger brother Rocky. Finally, the history of rock was a lot more complex, rich and vast than I imagined and that would remain the true revelation of the last years.']",4.00 stars

Desiderata,"['It’s pretty brilliant that they have come out with this album (especially after The Bends), that was so brand new and different and such a pioneer, while it was filled with very great pop songs and very catchy tunes.\nI think I only have around 10 albums on RYM’s all time top albums chart that I actually agree with making into the top 100, but OK Computer is definitely one of them. Not like all the songs were great on it, I mean it definitely has its low points (like Subterranean Homesick Alien) but you can absolutely forgive those because the album just makes sense in its whole, every song has its purpose and its rightful role, everything is in its right place (muhahaha). So I wouldn’t change even these weaker songs on OK Computer, because it is just good the way it is, it’s how it’s supposed to be.\nI have a theory that this album managed to be so good because it is exactly on the very thin line that borders kitsch. I mean no one can deny that it is dangerously close to being kitschy, (just think about the last epic chorus part of Karma Police or the kind of melodramatic Exit Music,) but it never really reaches it, it always manages to keep its balance. OK Computer is like a perfectly elaborated plan, it’s endlessly smart and it has every tune and every little sound in its perfect place, and yet it does not feel structured in an unnatural or artificial way. In the end I think this is what makes this album so great – so there goes my kitsch-theory. (I have another theory about Radiohead and their music – or at least the lyrics - being not very personal, but I am going to talk about that in my review for Kid A, not to ruin the mood now.)\nSo to summarize it: even though I kind of don’t really like almost half of the songs on this album, I would still agree that this is one of the greatest albums ever, and not a lot of records can make me say that.']",4.00 stars

I didn\'t really understand the magnitutde of his Radiohead-free existence until I took him along to see them live in June of 2008, having only being playing him In Rainbows prior to said gig so he would know the new material. I naively assumed he would know all the older stuff. Wrong (said very much in a Depeche Mode style).

I had to go a bit carefully here of course, what with the well known adage of ""too much of a good thing"" (and before you say it, Guy is no Mae West) in the back of my mind and the risk of overkill, so over the next year or so, I introduced one album at a time, allowing them to sink in and be digested and an opinion formed and just generally enjoyed.\n\nSo, here we are a few years later. Did I manage to convert a former Jacques Brel and Elbow fan into a Radiohead fan? Yep. Was it me and my teenage enthusiasm or was it the music. Both, probably. But last week when Radiohead announced 2 London gigs, Guy not only managed to get us tickets, but without any suggestion, got tickets for both nights. What a Stan!

Crowbar,"['This really is the best Radiohead album. Many fans will throw (metaphorical) stones at you if you critisize anything about Radiohead, but I have to admit I don\'t care that much for Kid A or Amnesiac. I can recognize that there is a certain brilliance to these albums, but that doesn\'t mean I ever really WANT to sit down and listen to them. Those are albums for the hardcore fan. This is an album for everyone. No one can deny the beauty of this album. It has a great flow, and you can listen to it for years without tiring of it. ""Paranoid Android"" has to fit somewhere in the top 20 best songs ever written. Hail to the Thief has a number of amazing songs, but also a fair number of largely forgettable ones. In Rainbows is pleasant from beginning to end, but lacks any real knock-out moments. OK Computer is nearly all knock-out moments, and yet there are still songs that come across as high points (Exit Music For a Film, No Surprises, and Karma Police in addition to the one I\'d already mentioned). I almost can\'t imagine there is a flaw in this album, though to be fair there probably are. With Kid A, I would advice new listeners to be cautious. They may love it. They may hate it.

I came in with some reservations, how could an album possibly be all of the things that people are saying about it. Not even hearing it, I had extremely high expectations, up until then, I listened to other stuff, but this was the top of Mt. Everest. And so with the highest of expectations, I bought this album, I was thirteen, and while I loved Classic Rock, I hadn\'t really expanded my horizons.\n\nListening to it, it topped the feeling I had listening to Dark Side of The Moon for the first time. It was an explosion of sounds. Relaxing at times, futuristic, while remaining down to Earth. I felt like I was in Deep Space Nine listening to ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" soo out of this world, but Earthy at the same time, if that makes sense.\n\nI didn\'t measure the future albums I listened to against OK Computer, because it would be unfair.

rockahol,"['Radiohead have almost always, for one reason or another, left a bad taste in my mouth. I\'ve referred to them as pretentious, overrated, grating, directionless, etc. and probably much worse. Yet now I find myself praising an album of theirs as highly as possible.\n\nIn nearly every capacity ""OK Computer"" is drastically different from the Radiohead albums that came after it. The song structure is tight and neat. It\'s really the only record of theirs you can even call ""progressive"" or ""experimental"" as everything since has relied on little or no songwriting craft to then build upon sonically. The atmosphere is warmer and more comfortable than the barren digital wasteland of a record like ""Kid A"" or the psychedelic disorientation of ""In Rainbows"" and the songs are more accesible.\n\nOne of my biggest gripes against Radiohead is Thom Yorke\'s singing. On their more recent albums he spends too much time trying to create and control tension with the shapeshifting, uber-falsetto that has become his trademark. This is foolish when you have Johnny Greenwood in your band. His guitar performances on this album are unforgettable. He is subtle when Yorke\'s vocals are driving the songs but cranks up the fuzz and gets nasty as the groove breaks down.\n\nLyrically it is less ambiguous, which I like, although the music alone is so good that Yorke could be singing anything and it wouldn\'t matter. I find him unintelligible most of the time anyway.\n\nI\'ve have harbored a deep prejudice against this band for a long while but even this can\'t prevent me from being profoundly impressed with the music here.

Morak99,"['I knew this album was never going to live up my expectations. With the reputation this thing has, you would expect it to reveal the meaning of life, give you fail proof advice as to how to make you a billionaire, and cure cancer. I knew it could never be as good as that. So I went in looking for something extraordinary, expecting to find something disappointing. I didn\'t really end up disappointed, and ended up with very nice bits. I\'ll take that.\n\nOK Computer is about three quarters a great album. There are a number of tracks I find rather impressive. This album manages to convey a cold and alien feeling, yet somehow is very relateable. This is really well exemplified from the get go. ""Airbag"" and ""Paranoid Android"" flow well, and have a brooding sound of keyboards and occasional guitar flourish to make it all come together. Very smooth, OK Computer is a very dreamy album. I\'m fond of such flowing tracks like ""Subterranean Homesick Alien""- for something so popular and loved, I\'m amazed at how subtle the whole affair is. If I could only take one to the desert island, I\'d go for ""No Surprises"", though, My issues come from deviations from this sound. It\'s all about the keyboards, and they\'re what carry this mood. Whenever the guitars or piano come out full force, the album becomes exponentially worse, usually. ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is horribly boring, for example, and ""Karma Police"" is a non event. Other than those instances, I don\'t find much to complain about, and ""Electioneering"" is an exception to that statement- it\'s very energetic and wakes the listener back up.\n\nI\'m happy with this purchase. While not among my all times favorites, OK Computer is the kind of album I can see people getting exited about.

This album began the journey of amazing sounds and mind sapping ingenuity that makes Radiohead such an amazing contemporary band. A true landmark in terms of the band's musical direction and freedom to break free of the chains of the conventional sounds that were occurring at the time.\nIn truth I haven't really thought of this album as being any near 'better' or more creative than there other albums which have all been amazing with great consistency, much to the likes of that of the Beatle's collection of records.

mcolville2,"['OK Computer 1997\n\nI essentially hear three things when I listen to this album. The Bends, The Beatles, and something that is just starting to emerge as the “Experimental” Radiohead. Experimental is in quotations because this is pop music, and experimentation involves usually only bringing back old tricks and styles of music from older generations and introducing them to a new generation. But first, why does this sound like the Bends still?\n\n\nHonestly, I don’t see the jump that much, just a different guitar tone. It isn’t such a bad thing either. I mean apart from a few of the songs relying more on atmosphere and studio-produced noises than the atmosphere of an acoustic rhythm guitar, the others are all written in the same style. But these songs are on the whole better. The message is clear that this album is about the decay of the individual in a society becoming more and more distant and coldly electronic. I don’t feel the paranoia though… and I remain completely unaffected by the message. What’s special about the album though is that the message is really an afterthought and the music stands alone as a great accomplishment. This is what mainstream pop should sound like, and it was light years behind the independent artists until this album brought it all back to now. After OK Computer, electronic pop artists started shooting up everywhere in a world where the acoustic alternative poppy ballad or Pearl Jam song formerly was King. Even people who never heard this album were affected in the years to come by its wide impact. But like I said, I don’t feel the paranoia, it’s too pretty, it isn’t experimental in the slightest, this is what pop music needed.\n\nThe fact that this is what mainstream music needed is what brings me to my next point, The Beatles. When The Beatles refocused pop music by basing their pop in rock n roll they were huge because they were marketable, and Lennon was one of a few willing to really sing his face off on Twist and Shout. What we wanted in the 90’s was a refocused mainstream scene. We didn’t want Pearl Jam anymore by ’97 and Nirvana was still ruling the day. The after effects of these bands were disastrous and came in the form of the Offspring and Blink-182. OK Computer made it ok to be a little softer. Instead of bringing rock n roll to the front, the way the Beatles did (and they had a ton of help) Radiohead brought the nursery rhyme ballad and the electronic sound to the mainstream. So what’s the difference between the two and why did this album eventually negatively affected the scene?\n\nWhen The Beatles “refocused” pop music they had contemporaries that were very capable. The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan are just a few. Radiohead really has and never had a contemporary to keep them in check. So while we aren’t as music crazy as the world seemed to be in ’65, we still love our pop music, and Radiohead took the throne, no longer as king of pop acts, but as Supreme Ruler. This became the Bible. It simply is not that good. Though it is very good. The point is, Sgt. Pepper’s was a great album, and everyone copied it, but after that was over, they moved on. The Stones made Exile on Main St., Dylan had 3 great albums at the same time. The Who did a whole assortment of things that were completely removed from Sgt. Pepper’s. OK Computer still rules the world in pop music. We haven’t had anyone challenge it in any way. This is the reason that I do not like Radiohead, or part of it anyway. They monotonized pop music for 10 years. I know that’s not a word, but still, I mean come on, indie music is now nothing more than a Radiohead look-alike contest. Of course we’re moving away from this album now, but damn are we late… 10 years?!\n\nThe third thing is the least important, so I’ve saved it for last. Radiohead is becoming modern Radiohead on this album. Their “More Experimental” side is just a new guitar tone and a slightly modified way of organizing a song to rely more heavily on studio production and percussion.\n\nI don’t love it, I don’t hate it, I don’t buy the message, but I don’t have to either. There are no actual emotions on this record and there is no paranoia. However, taken by itself, its still a damn fine record.\n\n8/10.']",4.00 stars
pidgeonhead,"['1997 was an interesting year for music in the sense that the stranglehold of Britpop heavyweights Blur, Oasis and Pulp ended. Their places would be taken by Radiohead and The Verve as these two seasoned bands would finally achieve mainstream success. Radiohead had gained a cult following both in fan circles and in the music press with their sensational album The Bends. Their only problem now was how to at least equal it. From the minute I heard OK Computer my overwhelming emotion was one of slight disappointment and when hearing everyone praising it to the hilt, this just added to my frustrations. Obviously recreating The Bends was not an option for a band so prone to experimentation but the cold, emptiness on parts of this album were for me, unsatisfying.\n\n""Airbag"" is a similar opener to ""Planet Telex"" as the scene is set in a seemingly futuristic setting or ""the next world war"" to be precise. Complete with crashing drums and heavy single-note riffing, Yorke describes surviving a near fatal car crash and what an interesting opener ""Air Bag"" is. The only slight downside being the studio trickery that consists of numerous stops and starts which affects the song\'s momentum. My first experience of ""Paranoid Android"" was when returning home after the end of my fifth year exams. When seeing the video on MTV I remember being utterly baffled by what I saw/heard and to some extent, I still am to this day. Yes it is rambling, yes it is pretensious and yes the lyrics are all over the place. Despite this, there are redeeming qualities in the general atmosphere and cohesiveness of it all.\n\nFor much of this album I could simply state ""not as good as anything on The Bends"". It would be easy. However, with ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" I find myself thinking just that. A generally sleepy ballad, it lacks the emotional depth of anything on the last album and the somewhat geeky subject of extra-terrestrials isn\'t every one\'s cup of cocoa. Jonny Greenwood\'s chiming guitar does, to some extent, enhance an otherwise ordinary track. Exit Music (For A Film) despite being a commendable enough effort, does sound a bit over dramatic. The theme of escape is set against theatrical style music and is a bit cringeworthy. Unfortunately, the appropriately titled ""Let Down"" is indeed a let down as Yorke tries to convey a snippet of modern day living. Sadly, it lacks any of the all consuming power of a ""Just"" or ""Iron Lung"". On what is the poorest track thus far, it features mumbled vocals and a melody very similar to ""No Surprises"". Try fitting in it\'s lyrics and you\'ll see what I mean.\n\nAfter some disappointing moments it\'s good to hear a nice, simplistic track like ""Karma Police"". Greenwood ditching his guitar in favour of the electric piano is a gamble which pays off as Yorke has great fun with his threatening words. Unfortunately, ""Fitter Happier"" is next and the less said about this, the better. After the chaotic ""Electioneering"" we reach the Massive Attack styled ""Climbing Up The Walls"" which is an obvious highlight. Dark and sinister it features lyrics that should probably merit an ASBO. The two most outstanding moments on OK Computer come in the shape of ""No Surprises"" and ""Lucky"". The former uses high pitched xylophone notes which work in tandem with Ed O\'Brien\'s guitar and this creates a sound simiar to The Velvet Underground\'s ""Sunday Morning"". ""No Surprises"" comes across as a very sad song, with an air of resignation to the future that lies in store despite the revolutionary-type line ""Bring down the government.""\n\nIn ""Lucky"", Yorke\'s theme is of one of positivity despite the mournful sound of the track. ""Pull me out of the aircrash, pull me out of the lake"" he sings. ""Lucky"" was actually released on the complation album Help which was a charity album for the war in the former Yugoslavia, so perhaps this was a surprise inclusion. Sadly, OK Computer doesn\'t end particularly well due to the lacklustre ""The Tourist"". Obvioulsy another finishing track such as ""Street Spirit"" was unlikely but did they have to provide us with such a lame effort as this? One can only imagine what the misfit teenagers who spent their lives finding solace in the angst-ridden ""Creep"" must have thought at hearing such a flimsy track as this. OK Computer, whlle being excellent in places, must go down as a disappointing follow up to The Bends. As a first album, it would have been an excellent way for a new band to introduce themselves but it\'s the too many lifeless moments on here that are a bit of a let down. I for one, am continually perplexed at the high praise this album gains.']",4.00 stars

Ol_Dirty_Bradstard,"['Eleven years ago, I was nine. I remember my father would drive down from Pennsylvania to Long Island to pick me up to spend time with him. This would happen 3-4 times a year. And on the six hour drive back up to Pennsylvania, he would play ""Pablo Honey"" (maybe like three or four tracks off of it), ""The Bends"", and ""OK Computer"" constantly. Being a nine year old, I clearly did not understand the brilliance that was Radiohead. But there was always something in Thom Yorke\'s voice that would dig inside your chest, tapping into your emotions, even if you were a nine year old boy. I didn\'t know the name of the band, I didn\'t know who they were, I just knew the music and his voice. Everything was always so distinct and original. I remember hearing Yorke\'s voice during ""Let Down"" for the first time. It made me miss my dad, because I never got to see him. And it made me miss my mom, because I was leaving her to go away for a while. I started to tear, but refused to cry. Yorke\'s voice was cutting straight through me, forcing me to actually show emotion. This was my first actual musical discovery.\n\nEleven years later, I shower this album with so much praise. There is not a single second of it that I would change. This album is one of the most beautiful things released in the past 20 years, maybe even more, and definitely the best album of the 90\'s. This album has always worked as a whole for me. From the start of ""Airbag"" to the end of ""The Tourist"", it sucks you in with every single subtle sound. It\'s been eleven years, and I still find myself spotting new things happening that I never noticed before. It\'s one of those albums where words can really do no justice. But this is Radioheads masterpiece, there magnum opus. Astonishing, life changing, beautiful, and challenging. Everything a record should be.\n\nFavorite Tracks: Paranoid Android, Let Down, Karma Police, No Surprises, Lucky']",5.00 stars

If such a thing is possible,(naming a record the best of a certain period), this is defenitly not the best album of the 90\'s. ""Karma Police"" , ""Let Down"", ""No Surprises"" and ""Electioneering"" are great songs, undeniable, but the rest bores me. One of the things that annoys me the most with Radiohead is the fact that some songs could have been much more interesting ones.

Toxodon,"[""Radiohead started with the massive success of their song 'Creep', and later with the album 'The Bends', but they reached brilliance with their masterpiece album 'OK Computer'. They had a hit with the amazing prog-rock single, 'Paranoid Android' and after that 'Karma Police' and 'No Surprises'. This is perhaps the definitive album of the '90s and certainly the best album of 1997. 'OK Computer' is a bit of an emotional roller coaster of different styles and sounds that all come together to make something truly memorable. After this album the band would take an entirely new direction but this will always remain their great pop/prog/art rock milestone. As future generations discover Radiohead they will no doubt be in awe of what the band did here. 5 stars. My favourite songs are 'Paranoid Android', 'Let Down', 'No Surprises', and 'Airbag'.""]",5.00 stars

It\'s not because I hate Radiohead (I really like The bends) or because I hate everything that\'s not accessible (I love Troutmask replica, Stupid dream, My life in the bush of ghosts and just about everything King Crimson ever did), it\'s just because I think these songs just aren\'t that good.\n\nLet\'s start with something positive and discuss the things on here that I like. ""Airbag"" is a nice opener. The drum sound may be awful, but the guitar riff is good and the whole song reminds me a bit of King Crimson\'s ""Red"". That\'s a good thing. ""Karma police"" is really a great song. As much as I hate Thom Yorke\'s voice, I must admit the song is great and when sung by somebody else (Joe Jackson performed it live in 1999) I actually enjoy it. ""Subterranean homesick blues"" is also a fine song, but give me anything from The bends over that anyday.\n\nThen we have ""Paranoid android"". It starts off as a good song, but it goes wrong once we get to the ""ambition makes you look pretty ugly part"". From that bit onwards its an awful combination of Thom Yorke screaming, loud guitars, an awful guitar solo from somebody who obviously hasn\'t had a lot of guitar lessons (is it Jonny Greenwood or Ed O\'Brien, who cares?), a slow closing section going back to a loud climax again at the end with no structure anywhere to be found. Did I mention those lyrics offwithhisheadmantheyuppiesnetworkingthevomitwhydontyouremembermynamefromagreatheightgodloveshischildren, sorry this stuff isn\'t just my cup of tea. Both ""Exit music (for a film)"" and ""Let down"" sound like Travis at their worst, lifeless uninspired britpop. ABBA sounds like hardcore punk compared to this.\n\nThen there\'s also 2 minutes of nonsense spoken by a computer program, another attempt at heavy metal or whatever, one small bit of glockenspiel music that turns out to be an entire song and we get to hear Thom Yorke repeating ""Hey man, slow down slow down"" over and over again. As far as choruses go, that\'s not really ""Mr. Tambourine man"", ""Hey Jude"", ""California girls"", ""Satisfaction"" or ""Sunny afternoon"" is it? The only thing good about that is that you know the album\'s over in a few minutes.\n\nI don\'t care what other people think about this album, to me it\'s a deeply disappointing follow up to the excellent The bends. The band is obviously not playing it safe, but to me this mix of nonsense lyrics, unstructured songs and electronic effects just doesn\'t sound right. There are a handful of highlights which I\'ve mentioned before, but it\'s all not enough to make the album anything more than average.']",2.50 stars
RoyalOrleans,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I love this album! I was only 6 or 7 when this came out, and had yet to really experience my first computer. I remember when my family had its first Red Macintosh - I used to play some archaic hunting game on the damned machine for hours, the first step in appreciating a computer for its entertainment value. Over the years, computers have come to define many of our human relationships. My family moved to Texas because my dad found a job on a computer. My friend makes his living playing videogames on a PC. Some of my wildest imaginings were prompted by the deep portals of the internet, and through this instrument all of us have been liberated into bloggers, artists, hackers, etc. Here we can make our own profession. This review is only available on a computer, there is no paper archive, no physical treasury. This doesn\'t scare me. The mass amounts of information available at our fingertips is necessarily double-edged - a reminder that there is more to discover, as well as a warning to turn off the laptop once in a while. My experience on message boards in particular has taught me valuable lessons about the intermediary role of communication, its positive and negative effects.\n\nEssentialy, whether I have used the phrase ""okay computer"" or not, my young adult life has been particularly marked by many different occasions in which I have had to retain some perspective as to the role and function of computers in my life. Passions inflamed by people you have never met? It\'s okay. Unsure about how secure your data is? It\'s okay. Lost a a whole cache of irreplaceable photos because of an accidental press of the delete key? It\'s okay - it\'s just a computer. I have poured many of my thoughts, much of my time, and energy into computers. I have learned about them, although I do not understand them. I have enjoyed them, and resented them. But mostly I have just come to view them as anything else in life - a part of the environment.\n\nTo me, this album is hopeful and inspiring. Much has been made of the dissociative and depressing quality of Yorke\'s lyrics. ""One day I am gonna grow wings/a chemical reaction/hysterical and useless (you are, you are)"" perhaps perfectly reflects what I find to be the sort of equanimity of Yorke\'s ""depressing"" lyrics. Our emotions, such as they are, are as magnificent as a soaring eagle and as simple and reductive as a chemical reaction. We experience them as flying, but the reasons are quite simple, quite mundane. I quite like this sort of realization - that the moments that make life most worth living has some sort of basis in my basic function as a human being. Even the most amazing moments of life are part of the normal, mundane cycles we all tread. I\'m sorry to talk away from actual music here, but this album is about human experience. I am writing from a train, losing myself in writing a review, listening to this album which at one point meant the world to me. For four years I left the album and Radiohead, though I have never resented them. Coming back to the album I find that I draw much intellectual enjoyment from analyzing it\'s content, whereas before I really just liked the way it sounds. And what would trains, buses, the metro be like without music? Imagine all these rote exercises without headphones, without the context of the music we listened to that morning, to make it all okay - to slow down that quickening pace of life to a few bars, to live in a few measure of music. That is maybe why ""Fitter Happier"" is so haunting - it does not mention music, it is sad, it is just human actions, without intonation or melody. It\'s a vision of apocalypse surrounded by the rest, those musical interpretations that show even the saddest beings find some sort of redemption in sound.']",4.50 stars

I heard reports in fall 1997 of critics (I don\'t know which ones) calling this the best album of all time. That was rubbish then as it is now, but I hadn\'t heard it to that point except ""Karma Police."" So I went into it with expectations and skepticism, which vanished quickly. I really dug it through college but didn\'t listen to it for probably 2005-06. Ten years is my personal yardstick for a \'great\' album\'s efficacy; I didn\'t have any emotion for <i>Nevermind</i> by 2001 and expected about the same for this. But it sounds fresh now, and as prescient and emotionally ranging as others have suggested. This isn\'t my favorite album, but it is really special as commercial music goes. I try not to be hyperbolic, but if you marked this with less than 3 stars, I don\'t think you like good music now.']",5.00 stars

In contrast with this, we are presented with the schizophrenic 'Paraniod Android', a truly stunning musical journey.

Lucky is my favourite one, Climbing Up the Walls and Let Down are close behind, and I wouldn't say I got bored of songs like Paranoid Android, No Surprises or Karma Police for now either. Maybe because of the memories, but these songs feel very layered, both in production and meaning, I think you can still find something new after several listens.

1SKEETER,"[""This CD is interesting. It has some really good use of technology, and is not cluttered. There are some interesting musical ideas, and in places it is melodic.\nThe overall approach to the recording is nice, and it sounds well thought out, within it's parameters.\nThe sound effects that augment the songs are interesting.\nBut, the musicianship and vocals lack.\nThe drums are a bit too basic and the drummer seems to not venture out into territory other than basic beats. The acoustic guitar sounds are nice, as are the clean guitar sounds, but when the marshall stacks come out, it sounds like the guitarists are trying to hide behind distortion rather than use the distortorted sounds to augment the music.\nThe backround vocals are very nice, very interesting. The lead vocals, however, are often the stereotypical whiney nasal style that pervades in alternative music. I don't think the vocals are well produced, they don't stick out in the mix and it is impossible to follow the story line of the songs, because the words are unintelligable most of the time.\nAt times this kind of sounds like ABBA with not as good of vocals and musical showmanship.\nAnd it sounds like the music is all done in just a couple of music scales.\nOverall, the production is quite interesting, and the shining element of the CD. The musicianship is lacking some, but seems adequate for the music much of the time.\nFor comparison, this sounds like a less ambitious equal to Synergy by Porcupine Tree.\n\nBut overall it is interesting to listen to, and is quite inventive at times. Music that blows me away ( as Synergy did) tends to reach out and grab me even if I am listening to it while doing other things. This CD didn't do that often, and toward the end of it I found myself not paying a lot of attention to it.\nThis is nice music, but nothing mind boggling. I don't understand what the hoopla about it is about.\nOn the other hand, I do see the appeal to it.\nI think with some better musicianship and some more inventive music that the arrangements would have worked a lot better.\nIn fact, it sounds almost as if the arrangments are too comlplex for the music and tend to get ahead of the music itself.\nI am glad I heard this, and may give it another listen. It certainly is a keeper, but not exactly the first thing I would reach for when looking for something to listen to in order to stimulate my mind.\n\nI think this CD could have benefitted with some more eclectic percussion sounds and at times some drums more along the lines of Tool. And the bass could have been played against the highs a little better if it was a bit beefier.""]",3.00 stars

nikka1991,"['Every so often, somewhere in the decade, an album is released that sets the standard for what and album of that particular genre should consist of. These albums push the boundaries and raise the bar. For the 60\'s it would be Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the 70\'s Dark Side of the Moon, the 80\'s..... Well, that one\'s harder, possibly The Joshua Tree by U2. As for the 90\'s most people narrow it down to Nirvana\'s ""Nevermind"" and Radiohead\'s ""OK Computer"". Well you can play it safe and narrow it down to halves, ""Nevermind"" defined alternative music for the first half of the 90\'s, however for the second half ""OK Computer"" came along and blew virtually every listener\'s minds, possibly musicians too, including R.E.M\'s Michael Stripe who calls Radiohead ""Impossibly good.""\n\nThis album would inspire many of today\'s artists who base their entire career off of the sound Radiohead gave us on OK Computer, notably artists like Coldplay where you can hear that Radiohead inspired them. Some crown it the greatest album of all time, many claim it the album of the decade, yet I am torn somewhere in between.\n\nOK Computer, right from the start is like an ecstatic pulse of joy to the eardrum. The songs are undoubtedly nothing short of genius masterworks. ""Air Bag"" is about being saved in an automobile accident by an airbag. Whereas many of the other songs fall along similar subject lines, technology being involved in our very lives. The sonic, spacey guitars of ""Airbag"" then shift to the modern day masterpiece ""Paranoid Android"", which you might be able to crown as the modern day ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" or ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"", considering how it builds and shifts into a mini set of songs. ""Paranoid Android"" is undoubtedly my favorite track on the entire album. On the very day I purchased the album at this point I was thinking ""Holy **** this is amazing already"". ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" sounds reminiscent of Pink Floyd, if you chopped up Dark Side of the Moon along with your household computer, I am sure if it came out as a song, this is exactly what it would sound like. ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" was cut from the 1997 rendition of Romeo and Juliet soundtrack, for no particular reason other than Radiohead liked the song too much to give it up for a soundtrack, and I really couldn\'t argue with them. The track is a slow, heartbroken, haunting acoustic track, where Thom Yorke whispers over the microphone, it is a beautiful experience. ""Karma Police"" is a true classic, the piano is great, it uses violins that notably DON\'T sound like Elanor Rigby by the Beatles, which was another first, It\'s undeniably great.\n\nThings then move on to the bone chilling ""Fitter Happier"" which tells the sad story of what is expected from you of society, how sad it sounds to leave a perfect life, it adds a layer of loneliness to ones public life. ""Electioneering"" has a jerky guitar rhythm and is the most fast paced track on the album. ""No Suprises"" is another one of the better known tracks on the album and is beautiful, sounding like the noise the toys that hang over a baby\'s crib makes, yet an ultimately dark subject matter, I know of no other artists that pull this off so greatly. ""Lucky"" is my second favorite song on the album, it tells the story of a man who had just got in a plane crash and survived.\n\nThe album ends and I realize that I may have very well just heard the greatest album of all time, every single time the damn thing ends. I then want to listen to it over again.']",5.00 stars
miccc,"[""Because there are already so many excellent and thorough reviews of this album, I will just give a brief account of the impact this music has had on me. Having purchased the cd on a good friend's recommendation in 2005, I was a relative latecomer to Radiohead. After hearing it about three times in its entirety I realized that I was listening to a work of extraordinarily rare beauty and complexity. In fact, it had been 30 years since I had experienced anything so stunningly powerful and well crafted, and that was Led Zeppelin's towering masterpiece, 'Physical Graffiti' released in 1975. My appreciation and understanding of 'OK', as well as the intensity of enjoyment, continues to grow and deepen with each successive spin(now numbering well into the thousands). This is an enduring masterwork, that holds its own with the very finest music, of any genre, ever recorded. Regardless of your particular taste in music, give this album a chance and you will be forever glad you did.""]",5.00 stars

Strangely I was never familiar with Creep although I must have heard it on the radio more than a couple of times. This lead that my first experience with Radiohead was their 2 lead singles from this album ""Paranoid Android\' and ""Karma Police"". I loved Paranoid Android but mostly because of the video for it and my opinion on Karma Police is kind of forgotten right now, but I remember that I found them both beautiful but extreme depressive songs. And I loved the name Radiohead :)\n\nThe album Ok Computer came into my life when I was about 14 years old. I lend it from my dad and at the time I was totally unaware of the praise it had gotten over the years or even that Radiohead was one of the biggest bands of our time. I was just a small kid playing Nirvana, Metallica and a little bit of alternative radio friendly music, oh and Slipknot and Korn of course. The album didn\'t strike me at all. In fact I found it vague, depressing and really strange to say the least. The only songs I listened to in those times were again to 2 mentioned lead singles and perhaps Airbag and Exit Music for a film.\n\nNow a year of 2 later a friend told me about Ok Computer and that it was supposed to be the best album of all time according to some polls he saw. He himself loved it and said to me that I should give it a try again. I of course liked a couple of songs on the album already, so I putted the disc in my stereo and started listening. I was stunned how beautiful it was and in no time the album was standing in my all time top albums, then consisting of nothing more then my good old Slipknot, Korn, Metallica and Nirvana albums with of course Metallica’s Ride the Lightning leading it on the number 1. I later on discovered the rest of Radiohead’s catalogue which, besides the bends, took some time as well to really click with me. Kid A took like 2 years but it worked.\n\nThe thing I have with Radiohead is that every 4 -6 months I’m craving for the band and I usually end up listening to mostly Kid A and Ok Computer because of the extreme amount of emotion packed into these songs. The prime examples on this album are the 2 epics “Climbing up the Walls” and “Lucky” which are 2 of my 3 favourite songs on here (together with Exit Music for a Film). Those songs really get to me in a way almost no other piece of music can get to me. Both songs are songs that I can put on non-stop and it are songs where the solos and climaxes are beyond words. In the first mentioned Thom Yorke even screams the final words, which is again beyond words.\n\nAfter about 4 years of playing this album to death it still hasn’t give in any of the power it had. In fact I now like it even better then say a year before, it’s like a fine wine that gets better with age, but so fine it was already incredible when it was made.']",5.00 stars

I\'ve heard before that what songs a person likes the most on this album say a lot about their musical tastes, so I\'ll mention my favorite songs from the album first.\n\nMy #1 pick is ""Karma Police"", and I also really like ""Paranoid Android"", ""Let Down"", and ""No Surprises"". ""Let Down"" and ""No Surprises"" are the catchiest songs on the album, while ""Karma Police"" is a terrific Beatles rip-off (and I really love the coda). ""Paranoid Android"" is pretty scary, as is ""Climbing Up the Walls"".\n\nThere are some other interesting things on here, too; ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" was supposed to sound like Miles Davis, but it came out more like an outtake from The Dark Side of the Moon. ""The Tourist"" also reminds me of Pink Floyd. Plus, ""Airbag"" is the only song I know of about surviving a car wreck.\n\nRadiohead have a knack for interesting arrangements on their songs, like the glockenspiel on ""No Surprises"" or the fuzz bass on ""Exit Music"" that I thought was a synthesizer until the Internet told me otherwise. And I\'m not the first person to mention that Thom Yorke only sings the vowels in each word.\n\nThe main problem with this album is the songwriting.

Jim_Dead,"[""I remember rushing out to buy 'OK Computer' on the day of it's release. I'd gotten into Radiohead a year or two earlier when I heard 'The Bends' (another masterpiece).\n\nI'd never really been into British music, I was more drawn to what was going on over the water (the US provided me with Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, The Afghan Whigs, Screaming Trees etc - which appealed to me more).\n\nBut Radiohead really blew me away. They didn't just create an atmosphere through sonic landscapes, there was songs and they were outstanding songs.\n\nThe one-two intro of Airbag and Paranoid Android was daunting, and still is. Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music and Let Down were all, in someway, joyous. Climbing Up The Walls was unsettling, but extraordinary. Not to mention Karma Police, No Surprises and Tourist.\n\nI still think 'Ok Computer' is a stunning, even haunting record which still stands tall after all this time.\n\nOK Computer gave British music the shot in the arm in badly needed. It pushed the boundaries of what musicians could do - why should an ambitious idea remain an ambitious idea? Make an ambitious record (Paranoid Android).\n\nDaring, ambitious and although it isn't instantly accessible, it's rewarding.\n\nThe computer age, indeed. Without a doubt a classic album. A career peak.""]",5.00 stars

Especially an album that has been commented on and disected about a billion times before by a billion other people.\n\nI\'m not even sure it\'s as good as the way I feel about it - but does that really matter? It\'s not pretentious or boring as naysayers might try and argue. It\'s a collection of observations basically, but not souless, intellectual observations that judge. Rather, Radiohead acknowledge and infuse a kind of understanding and empathy into stories about people they might not and we may not even understand. It\'s also about the way we cope with the world - by creating a false sense of security (Airbag), to hiding behind materialism until it turns us into monsters (Paranoid Android) to dreams of escape (Exit Music, Subterranean Homesick Alien), feelings of hopelessness and hopefulness mixed together (Let Down), rage (Climbing up the Walls) and giving up (No Surprises).\n\nStrip away all the analysis though, and you just find some great songs.

I like No Surprises, and Karma Police, and a couple of other individual tracks. But the album as a whole seems to vague, experimental, and up-its-own-arse for me. Admittedly it may have more secrets to divulge to me on future spins, so I'll stay open-minded.\n\nOK, now I've lsitened to this more, I absolutely love it. The gently strummed acoustic guitars in the background throughout, the unwavering sense of bleakness and melancholia: it's just genius - all of the little bits of random noise contribute, the track order is so perfectly crafted. Above all I love the sense of solitarity, and alienation, that of being all alone in a world where everyone else seems to be devoting their time to something you don't understand. I would say Subterranean Homesick Alien is one of the best, due to the capture of this emotion, and No Surprises also for the ambience of resignation and acceptance. Let Down too.

From the first track, ""Airbag,"" with its sweeping guitar and hypnotic drum beat, the music is brilliant, rich, atmospheric, and enthralling. Every note, sound effect, and lyric adds to the whole of this album to create a masterpiece. ""Paranoid Android"" is an instant classic; a three part epic of isolation and madness. There is nothing that is on this album that shouldn\'t be; even ""Fitter Happier"" with its electronic voice and eerie piano makes for an excellent mood-establishing track to begin the album\'s second half.

trotz,"['This is a 90’s CLASSIC. A true metamorphosis of the band, Tom York leads Radiohead truly through experimentation. And it is with this album that they do the most convincing balance between rock music, electronic and experimentation. This album marks the beginning of a new era of alternative rock and inspired a whole group of bands, like early Muse, Coldplay, Doves, just mentioning the main.\n\nIn the top of progressive songs of this album, there is ""Paranoid Android"". Without a doubt, it is a progressive track, there’s no way to avoid it! It is constituted by three different parts: the first, Sadness, with a well orchestrated versus/chorus pattern; the second, The Explosion, in which the guitar, the bass and the drums are very well performed; and the last, The Depression with a very moving melancholic cascade of voices. Following we have the atmospheric ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" and the catchy ""Let Down"". ""Exit Music (for a film)"" is again a 2 part track with the last being an explosion part, like in Paranoid Android, but mainly achieved by emotional vocals. The two rockers of the album, beyond the supreme ""Paranoid Android"" itself, it’s the first track ""Airbag"" which presents a very catchy guitar riff and a great bass work and the almost punky ""Electioneering"" which could be a song taken from their previous albums. The album ends with the trio ""No Surprises"", ""Lucky"" and ""The Tourist"" with the melancholic mode and the imaginative soundscaping that characterizes Radiohead.\n\n""Karma Police"" is an unforgettable ballad, very dramatic, extremely beautiful, great sonority and without having the prototype of the traditional architecture of a track: it is subdivided again in 2 parts.\n\nA very original crafted lushed album.

lonely_panda,"['Up until the last couple months, I have only heard OK Computer in airports/train stations for the last 5 years; In an age when everyone has an opinion on OK Computer, it\'s the only way to keep it safe and sacred to me. Since it\'s gone from being ""one of the best albums of the 90s"" to ""One of the best albums ever"" over the last couple of years, the counter-culture crowd have not been kind to Radiohead and their magnum opus. I can\'t imagine how awful it would be to hear this album at the wrong moment in the wrong environment and hear it as Rolling Stone\'s #162 album of all time or even worse ""over hyped garbage"". I feel OK Computer has done so much for me on a emotional and imaginative level, that at the very least I can do is protect it from the outside world\'s opinions that I was oblivious to as a kid.\n\nI never fully got the concept of a band by the time I was 10. Even though my brother had one and I had a favorite band (I think Superdrag), I still didn\'t get the concept entirely. Radiohead only furthered this weird state of mind, as I spotted posters and icons that connected to the band. I went to a friend of a friend\'s house who had a OK Computer poster on his wall; I can\'t explain the feeling it gave me to see it. It was like he had the mark of Cain and we all belonged to some club that was meant for something more in the world. VHS tapes that say Radiohead on it, weird t-shirts my brother would wear with hand breaking glass that said Radiohead, and this ugly cover with a baby\'s face I was given as a present that said Radiohead on it. Perhaps in the same way growing up with The Beatles might have done, finding OK Computer at such an early age gave me such a unexplainable excitement on what art can do and be; It felt more like a movement to save the world at the end of the century and we all were going to be apart of it.\n\nAside from becoming a cure for insomnia in 97, it became the soundtrack to going in and out of airports and train stations. Such an exciting, wonderful place where cold, industrial design makes the light come in like a ray of heaven. All the strange noises and announcements, sounding far from human but resembled us well enough. The people going in and out of my life at an overwhelming rate. It was a place that made everything seem possible and probable; Watching it all go by to the soundtrack of OK Computer just clicked with me on such a deep level and still does. To see so many people in such a detached state in one of the most curious places you can be (could you imagine what people from past generations would think of these establishments?), was as wonderful as it seems scary now.\n\nI can\'t talk about how Selway implemented DJ Shadow breaks and loops in the drums or how Greenwood\'s use of guitar effects are beyond anything else ever, as the album will never speak to me that way and I never would want it to. What I can talk about is how odd my connection to the album is nearly 10 years later. It\'s made me recall many things I\'ve forgotten, that I guess I kept to myself in the airports/train stations. Like how I was 100% convinced I was an alien until I was 12 and was ready to be brought home any moment or how I saw the boogyman standing next to my bed watching me sleep within my dreams various times. I guess now it would be about alienation and the boogyman is the government putting cameras everywhere, but there is something still very tangible and haunting in those earlier beliefs. OK Computer will always be a huge chunk of escapism in my life, I wouldn\'t be surprised if I have a mid-life crisis one day and sleep at an airport terminal for a night playing OK Computer. Much like Laughing Stock and In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, OK Computer takes me so deep into a world I can never compare to the one I currently occupy; I guess the thing that makes it better is that it feels like I\'m returning to something at the same time.\n\n+Contains Lyrics+\nAlbum Art/Packaging: A+\n""Rent"" or Buy: Buy']",5.00 stars

Subterranian Homesick Alien (the title partially stolen from a Bob Dylan song, but not to the extent that it's black market Oasis stolen) is probably my favourite track on the album, probably because it's as ambient and dreamy as songs from The Bends.\n\nProbably the main reason why I returned this CD to ask for my money back was because of all the indie kids and art school assholes who bang on about Radiohead RADIOHEADRADIOHEADRADIOHEADRADIOHEADRADIOHEADRADIOHEAD\nbut also because the album itself didn't do anything for me- I felt bored and sleepy. Dunno, maybe it is me, maybe someone should slap me something silly. I cringe everytime I hear Climbing Up The Walls, because I think of all the music nuts in Japan going waahhh everytime the singer mouths the first vocals. I myself couldn't make an album to save my life (unless I told the everyone it was intended as an ironic joke), and I can perhaps grasp the strain, etc this band were under while making it, but it's not something I would class as one of the greatest of all time.

utopiandrive,"[""Maybe there is no hope for society after all. Maybe the human race is fated to self-destruct in a blaze of glory without ever having understood its purpose or meaning in this strange existence. It hardly matters though, because the beauty of life itself has a way of transcending its torments, and OK Computer teaches us how unmistakably true this is.\n\nIn a world of escalating superficiality and materialism, Radiohead were able to depict so intricately and beautifully the collective psyche of our current reality and the pitfalls of the direction we are headed in. The most special thing about OK Computer is Radiohead's ability to channel the feelings of society and express it in such a real and affecting way. This album is not about Thom Yorke or the band's other members, it's about our collective dynamic with the world we live in. It's a kind of musical 'mirror' of the thread of feelings that runs through us all, even if we are not conscious of them.\n\nWhat makes OK Computer more formidable is the vibrant and mesmerizing energy created by its power and spirit of truth. It's an energy I want to get lost in because the realness and and specialness of it will never be matched by the world as we know it. It gives me enough distance to help me achieve a clearer perspective on life and what I want out of it, which is the overall spiritual effect OK Computer has had on me. That's the mystery and the beauty of it; the mystery being how OK Computer lets you understand 'life' more clearly while letting you escape from it, and the beauty being that when you see reality as it is, it loses its ability to harm you metaphysically.

Paranoid Android defines epic and has a riff at one point that rivals the riff used at the climax of bohemian rhapsody (AKA massive head bang) Subterranean Homesick Alien is worthy of Floyd. Exit Music is chilling and dark. Let Down is wonderfully dreamy. Karma Police i can\'t really describe the emotion it\'s like epic in a short amount of time. when it gets to the end its just incredible. electioneering is a bit too rocking for this album but its still fun to listen to. climbing up the walls is dark and creepy and took me awhile to get into but still great track to listen to. No Surprises reminds me of the dreamy style of Let Down except dreamier. Lucky is a bleak song until the ""chorus"" which is so lush it gives you chills. The Tourist is an epic closer with some fantastic vocals. One of the few overhyped albums out there deserves every bit of praise its given. I wish more modern bands could take a cue from Radiohead. This album gives me hope for the future of music. I\'m seriously proud to be a fan of this album and hope that this album can reach others and touch them as it did me']",5.00 stars
mpatton,"['I\'ve owned OK Computer since the week it came out, and I am a little surprised how it has grown in stature. Left for dead by the public upon its initial release (but not critics), OK Computer quickly became \'the best album of all-time\' when the 14 year-olds of \'97 started up their blogs and webzines in the 00s.\n\nTo me, the sound of the record is too cold. Between ""No Surprises"" and the computer-voiced ""fitter happier,"" OK Computer seemingly is the sound of losing all hope; and wallowing in it. Though, very well done wallowing. Perhaps some will see it as a call to arms, but, I don\'t know, even Yorke\'s vocals on ""Exit Music (for a Flim)"" suggests that he is worn out and has given up, when the lyrics suggests that he should be fighting for his love (Juliet?).\n\nIt\'s just that, even at my most cynical, I hold on to shreds of optimism; and I guess I want that reflected in my music as well. I saw Radiohead in concert back in June (because I had access to some tickets), and I looked into the crowd during ""Paranoid Android"", and it seemingly was a group of people that collectively feel disaffected by, and powerless against, their surroundings. Perhaps it is a feeling that I sometimes share, but not necessarily one I want to augment. Of course, this review may seem contradictory to my 4.5 rating of The Bends and my 4.0 review of The Eraser, but the former Rawks a lot more than OK Computer and there is a sense of humanity in The Eraser. I just don\'t think I could ever embrace something this bleak.']",3.50 stars

birthofthecool,"[""What can I say about this album that hasn't been said before? Without hyperbole, it is one of the legitimate top ten albums of the 20th century. It is one of the few albums that has been loved by both the public and the critics, and is rightly portrayed as the most influential hour of music the '90s gave us.\nEvery song is a gem - even the weakest track ('Climbing Up the Walls') is essential.\nThe first six songs take you to that state of mental bliss that only music has the ability to do. Starting with 'Airbag', soaring through 'Paranoid Android' and ending with 'Karma Police' - I doubt there has been a stronger first half of an album on any record.\nThe second half isn't as good as the first half, but it is still fantastic. 'Fitter Happier' is a disturbing interlude, and 'Electioneering' is just brutal. 'No Surprises' has one of the creepiest riffs I have ever heard, while 'Lucky' sounds like the soundtrack to a wide-screen production of the apocalypse. That might sound cheesy, but when you hear it you'll know what I mean.\nThe album finishes with 'The Tourist' and ends with a single tap of a xylophone.

savoytruffle,"['OK Computer could be described as noise-rock. It\'s not your regular rock music: it\'s kind of intellectual; not always melodic; rarely pretty; but usually interesting. Thom Yorke, the android doing most of the programming, whines his way through the songs. His singing probably makes the album even less accessible than does the challenging nature of the music.\n\nThe songs seem to fall into two basic camps: pained and depressed on the one hand, and sceptical and faithless on the other. In the first category are ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" and the totally depressed sounding ""Let Down"". In the second category are ""Paranoid Android"", ""Karma Police"" and ""Fitter Happier"" (not so much a hidden track as a small-print-track on my CD). ""Electioneering"" is the closest Radiohead get to rocking out, and the topic is punk in character - skepticism directed at politicians. What is clear from the songs is that Radiohead are disillusioned and disenchanted with the world around them. And this to such an extent that even a song entitled ""Lucky"" sounds as if it sung by the unluckiest person on earth. Finally, in ""Tourist"" they tell us to slowdown. That\'s a piece of advice most of us could do well to follow in our hectic, time-pressured lives.\n\nAll in all it\'s pretty glum listening. Something for a damp, grey winter\'s day maybe. It\'s not totally without reward for the listener, but there is much easier gratification to be found elsewhere. Plus you don\'t have to listen to Yorke\'s singing!']",3.00 stars

p_q,"['""Pull me out of the aircrash""\n\nThe Bends had established Radiohead as an important band, but the trouble was that it was a fully-formed realisation of their sound, so they had to look beyond the realms of ordinary guitar rock for their next album. OK Computer confirmed Radiohead\'s staying power and gave them a permanent reservation to dine at rock music\'s top-table.\n\nAfter the musical conservatism that had been the trademark of far too much British guitar music in the mid 90s, OK Computer was an album of vaulting ambition which caused rock bands around the world to take a long hard look at themselves and wonder why they hadn\'t thought of that. OK Computer was by turns rocking, tender, terrifying and utterly depressing, which was more than enough to lodge in the psyche of every moody and disenchanted soul in their late teens and early twenties. Radiohead had become the voice of a generation by pointing out that we\'re all going to hell in a handcart.\n\nOK Computer is a musically inventive, intelligent and hugely pretentious album. It\'s prog-rock reinvented for the new millennium (something which left Marillion trying to claim that they had been doing it for years. They hadn\'t.), it has guitar anthems like ""Electioneering"", ""No Surprises"" is a twisted nightmare of a lullaby, ""Lucky"" and ""Paranoid Android"" are songs which make the best of their complex arrangements and ""Fitter Happier"" is a pep-talk typed out in SimpleText with speach enabled. Cast just weren\'t capable of stuff like this.\n\nThere is a downside though, such musical invention led to Radiohead sounding even more smug than usual, which is something of a turn off for me. Yes it\'s a clever album, but is there any need to be so bloody self-satisfied about it? Thom Yorke\'s vocals in particular suffer from his desire to deliver everything in angst-ridden whine, instead of delivering the lyrics in a clear and understandable manner. Personally I think Yorke sounded better on The Bends.\n\nPerhaps this is unfair nit-picking, OK Computer is unarguably one of they key albums of the 90s, as it encouraged all manner of bands to raise their respective games. It could be argued that OK Computer\'s inventiveness revealed the inherent deficiencies in so many sub-par British guitar bands, which caused so many of these bands to eventually split due to lack of public interest. What cannot be argued is that it made ambitious rock fashionable again.\n\n""Ambition makes you look pretty ugly""']",3.50 stars

It contains the hits ""Paranoid android"" ""Karma Police"" and ""No Surprises"".\n\nAn album that came at the right time between the development of prog rock, the end of alternative rock, and the birth of the e-world, it marks the perfect moment where human kind was being confonted to fear, and alienation.\nNow, when I listen to it, it really sounds like an indie album and nothing much more.\nI guess this means that Radiohead has really developed and matured, and that they are no Oasis or Blur.\n\nMusically, this album contains some of Radiohead\'s most well known songs, ""Airbag"" ""Paranoid android"" ""Exit Music""(from Romeo and Juliet), ""Karma Police"" and ""No surprises"". The best track on here would have to be ""Lucky"" which set the tone nicely for what was to come, and there is also ""Fitter Happier"" is an absolute stroke of genious (something which was going to be further developed in ""Kid A"").\n\nDespite this, this is no doubt Radiohead\'s best, perhaps on par with Kid A.

Ondes_Martenot,"['Consumerism, globalisation, postmodernism, social alienation, depression, paranoia...\n\nThe themes of the album, although never being a part of a concept, have stood the test of time and are as relevant as they were back in 1997. By keeping its relevance, OK Computer has become one of the most important albums of our time.\n\nAlthough, influenced by several musicians of different styles like Miles Davis, Krzysztof Penderecki, The Beatles and DJ Shadow, OK Computer cannot be compared to any other album. It\'s unique and innovative to an extent, yet not completely revolutionary. It\'s atmospheric and beautiful in it\'s own way, yet not everyone\'s cup of tea. Despite all its paradoxes, OK Computer could quickly acclaim the classic status by music critics and mutual admiration amongst fans.\n\nFrom the very beginning of Airbag, the adventurous mood is set and it guides us through the whole album without being absent even for a second. It\'s only the listener and the music, and nothing in between. Even the six and a half-minute long, the modern guitar rock classic Paranoid Android sounds too short.\n\nAs the album progresses and arrives to probably the best combo on the whole album, hopeless Exit Music (For a Film) and completely alienated and instrument preferred Let Down. The two songs have almost nothing alike, yet they flow together in the best possible way. The first half of the album ends with piano-based, Beatlesque Sexy Sadie-like Karma Police which is probably the most accessible and radio-friendly composition here.\n\nFrom Fitter Happier to Climbing Up the Walls, OK Computer is at it\'s darkest and most disturbing before arriving to it\'s climax as Yorke\'s effortless voice in the xylophone-driven and poignantly beautiful No Suprises almost whispers ""A heart that\'s full up like a landfill/a job that slowly kills you"" ""I\'ll take a quiet life/\na handshake of carbon monoxide/with no alarms and no surprises"".\n\nAs Jonny Greenwood\'s guitar\'s almost crying on Lucky and The Tourist, the album gets it to closing act leaving no regrets in the listener who\'s begging for an encore.\n\nMusically, of course, it\'s always been an important and an enormously influential modern rock album as the huge number of Radiohead-copycats has shown us... Still, OK Computer is in the league of it\'s own, never having to confront a follower that could have matched the standard set by Thom Yorke and Co.\n\nIt\'s not even Radiohead\'s best album, but no other release by them sounds as refreshing and uplifting after neglecting it for some period of time.\n\nOK Computer still remains one of the best albums ever recorded.']",5.00 stars

QUAKER,"['So I have been given an assignment to review two albums in my collection that I have rated similarly and eventually pick which is my favorite. The records chosen for me are Radiohead ""Ok Computer"" and Wire ""154."" Both of which at the time I had rated 3 stars.\nMy first impression of the records and this assignment before going back to listen to them was that these two records mark the turning points of both these bands. Which was partly the reasoning behind the choice of these albums. But on a more personal level this is also the point in which I quit listening to both of these bands. Which probably has a lot to do with my original 3 star rating of each of these albums. I know people who will sing the praises of both of these bands after these points, but I could never get into their later stuff.\nUpon listening to these records again I couldn\'t help but realize I was wrong on my original ratings. I can\'t help but wonder if that wasn\'t part of why these records were chosen for me. I can\'t remember ever enjoying 154 as much. One thing that I noticed about both of these records is that this is where both of these bands started to use electronics. Wire goes for a much darker sound, while Radiohead uses it more in the background to highlight the songs. All in all if I have to chose one over the other it would have to be this Radiohead album largely because I believe that this is the high point of their career, while Wire was never quite able to live up to ""Pink Flag"" (though ""Chairs Missing"" was close). In fact I probably overlooked ""154"" all these years because I wanted another ""Pink Flag"", when the only way to truly appreciate it is by keeping it separate and letting it stand alone. But in the end I have a renewed appreciation of both these albums and I now think they are both great.']",4.50 stars

nesgamer1991,"['Let me start off first by saying that this is probably my favorite album of all time, none in my collection top this one, the first song is already genious, it\'s about the fear of car wrecks, and to think, it\'s about the happiest song on the whole album, I knew from the moment I first heard it that this was something special, it then follows up with ""Paranoid Android"" which is one of my favorite tracks on the album, I love how it starts off rather quiet, then it ends loud, the following song reminds me of Pink Floyd in ways thinking how spaced out and trippy it is, ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is another favorite of mine, I like how it builds later in the song, it reminds me of the tragic scenes in movies, where someone dies. ""Let Down"" is another great song, then ""Karma Police"" kicks in which is one argubly the best track on the album. The album is a simple masterpiece, and just when i thought it couldn\'t get any better I heard ""No Suprises"" which is a peaceful song, yet it sounds rather depressing, another masterpiece.

redlinewk,"['Back when I was a young whippersnapper, I thought if music was on a major label and used non-power chords, then it was pretentious and worthless. Then I got OK Computer, basically because everyone was raving about it. I loved it immediately. This opened the doors of music for me, and got me into pop music (in turn exposing me to older music to which I was basically oblivious, like Bob Dylan and Iggy Pop). I\'ve never heard a perfect album, but this one is close: a pessimistic look into the near future in musical form; a cold, jagged stair-climb to an unknown place (I always took it that Kid A was kind of a sequel to OK Computer and starts at the mysterious setting of ""The Tourist""). Actually, one of my few complaints is how the album ends; I\'d have preferred a conclusive finishing track (if they stuck ""Everything In It\'s Right Place"" on the end, then the album\'d be pretty much untouchable). I think it\'d be a stretch to call music this captivating ""pretentious"" and I recommend this as a great starter for anyone who wants to become more involved with music.']",4.50 stars

Neil_Rackers,"[""Ahh....reviewing OK Computer. Odds are, you've heard this album before, especially if you're here. If you haven't you should give this at least 3 listens, please? Word of warning: it's not like anything else from the 90s, it's not straight forward, and it's its own genre of rock. If you find out you like this, you truly have great taste in music.\n\nThe album for me starts at Paranoid Android. I've never been too big on Airbag as it doesn't do the album justice. Airbag's a great song, but you'll soon see that it won't compare to the un-earthly sounds you'll hear in the tracks to come. Paranoid Android is complex, original, crisp, nostalgic, etc,. It's really tough to get a full grasp on everything this song is, and describing it to someone who's never heard it is close to impossible. If you haven't though, I would say it's like watching a sunset in the fall somewhere in New England when the leaves have all changed color, probably late October. Then something hits you, like a baseball or a rock, and you go unconscious. You have a strange dream while you're out, but then you realize you're dreaming and you scramble to try to gain consciousness. Yeah, that's it. :)\n\n\nSubterranean Homesick Alien is great, but not nearly on the same level as Paranoid Android. I feel bad for it because it has to follow the best song of its decade, yet it's still unique and carefree, though not as intense as Paranoid Android was. This is probably the best song to get high to on the entire album due to it's calming, happy feel.\n\nExit Music (For a Film) rounds out the big 3 tracks on OK Computer. It's like Subterranean Homesick Alien but with more earthly sounds and a darker feel, probably the most depressing song on the album yet still one of the most beautiful.\n\nThe next 6 tracks can not compare to beginning of the CD, but among them, the ones that stand out the most are Karma Police and No Surprises. Fitter Happier is a very cool song at first because of the lyrics and the overall layout of the song, but it's probably the only song on the track the wears on me after all these years of listening. Luckily it's a very short track, the shortest on the album. Lucky and The Tourist seem more low-key and have very similar songs. It's almost a transition into the less experimental, style you'll hear on Kid A.""]",4.50 stars

Other good songs include Karma Police because it sounds like Sexy Sadie, No surprises, which is nice and simple sounding, and finally Lucky, which is probably the second best song on the album.\n\nSongs I\'m indifferent to: Airbag is alright although for some reason it reminds me of a U2 song, which isn\'t good cause U2 sucks. Subterranean homesick alien is a poor followup to Paranoid Android.\nLet Down is a let down. Fitter Happier is only a few levels above the Beatles no9, which means its barely tolerable. electioneering is actually an alright song but not as good as the ones in the like section.

The atmospheric brilliance continues with the wrenching ""Exit Music"", the strange and comedic but infectiously catchy ""Karma Police"", and the breathtaking and sweeping ""Lucky"". OK Computer also contained the 1990s\' most culturally significant lyrical themes, especially in the bizarre, gripping ""Fitter Happier"". Simply put, this album focuses on the growing presence of technology (i.e. the computer) in society and its growing control of the masses. Still, regardless of theme, OK Computer is a masterful set of adventurous musical arrangements and superb melodies and is most definitely the best record of its time.']",5.00 stars

yamstick,"[""OK Computer is an album with an incredible reputation, one I feel it almost lives up to. Radiohead are masters of filling out songs with little nuances that keep the music fresh after repeated listening. The music is fairly dense, there is a lot going on here and a true appreciation of the album only comes through repeated listenings. Basically with this album Radiohead branched away from the alternative guitar rock sound of the Bends. Traces of that sound are still here but are filled out by other elements - new sound combinations and a much wider instrumentation. The band were much more innovative and creative with this album but didn't sacrifice the great melodies that made The Bends so great. The lush production values also make the album and absolute pleasure to listen to, it really is a treat on the ears. Thom Yorke's smooth, distinctive voice is beautiful to listen to and fits into Radiohead's sound like a glove. The instrumentation is also very creative with some great innovative guitar playing and awesome effects that add to the songs.\n\nThe songs themselves are all beautiful, individual and powerful pieces of music. There is a sense of sadness about the record which varies from the detached melancholy of Karma Police to the full on depressive suicide that is Exit Music. With the exception of the rocking Electioneering the album is quite slow and reflective resulting in a great flowing listening experience. The only thing that may put people off is Fitter Happier... a robotic spoken word piece with some background effects. It fits into the album well in my opinion and I don't mind listening to it along with the rest of the music. Paranoid Android may be the most innovative thing here, it is a multi part epic, comparable to stuff like Bohemian Rhapsody and really is something. I haven't even mentioned half of the songs and the great things they do. Really the album is a classic and will be remembered by future generations. When a band changes their sound into something more 'arty' often things like melody and good song structure are comprimised. With Ok Computer, Radiohead made the transition to a different sound perfectly which resulted in one of the best albums of the 90's.""]",5.00 stars

There are periods when the album reaches a pinnacle with ""LetDown"" and ""Lucky,"" which are probably some of their best songs.\n\nYes, their music is depressing and emotionally wearing (usually not my style). But some people take their music a little too seriously and find it a reflection of some of their ""tragic"" lives - please. They have created such an obsessed fan base of ""intellectual"" poseurs.

Do me a favour though and chuck that ""Bends"" album in the bin though! And by bin, I mean ""multi disc CD changer"".\n\nObviously the band realised that ""The Bends"" was quite the generic 90s alt-rock album, because this album is hardly conventional at all! Its got flow, its got a ""concept"" (the dehumanisation and resulting apathy and paranoia caused by the rise and rise of technology in the late 20th century), and its filled with all sorts of interesting sounds and effects; much like mid 70s Pink Floyd. For those with fingers, I count electronic bleepy noises, bells, triangles, pianos, Macintosh voice boxes, and truckloads of guitar effects and overdubs - sound cool? However, those of us who have listened to a sound effects CD (yes, they exist) know that interesting noises don\'t always translate into ""good music"". Luckily, these aforementioned effects are often incorporated in interesting, creative ways that complement and enhance the songs instead of overwhelming them. For example: the sleigh bells and distorted drums on ""Airbag"", the heartbreaking xylophone/guitar duet and backing choir of black gospel Thom Yorkes on ""No Surprises"", the utterly beautacious electronic bleeping and tambourine drum part (?) in ""Let Down"", and the outer space guitarplay in ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"".\n\nThese are all great songs! Well written and well arranged. But some of these songs just don\'t cut the mustard (does anyone know the origin of this expression? Has anyone anywhere EVER cut mustard? I looked it up and NOONE KNOWS!) when compared to what Radiohead are obviously capable of. I don\'t like to name names, but the misleadingly titled ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" is a terribly stultifying ballad, ""Fitter Happier"" is a dramatic monologue performed by a Steven Hawking soundalike, ""Climbing Up the Walls"" is spooky but unmemorable, and ""Paranoid Android"" is much more interesting than entertaining. That\'s four songs; songs that aren\'t exactly bad songs per se, just songs that I personally never ever get the urge to listen to for whatever reason. Don\'t get me started on that hidden track either!\n\nOK Computer is a timeless record - sure, the guitars a bit mid 90s in places, but people in 20 years time will be listening to this and smiling the smiles of ears well satisfied. The way it captures the technophobia and insecurity of the late 90s (and indeed the new millennium) is an impressive achievement and not something to be sneezed at. I just don\'t think that this record is worthy of all the hype and acclaim that has been retroactively placed on it.\n\nThat cowbell in ""Electioneering"" is pretty cool, though.

He's a truly talented singer, he shines in every setting.\nAll in all this album is 5 stars, no question. There's no reason why you should not atleast give this a listen.

OK Computer did not, however, change the course of music. It is unassailable, a peak that not even Radiohead themselves can presume to attempt again. It would have been equally or more astonishing in any year before or since its release. Try saying that about any other album.']",5.00 stars
mthompson,"['Back when I was only a young lad (well, say five years ago), I heard all about this Radiohead band and how OK Computer is truly one of the great albums of our time. And I never disagreed as I had never heard anything from Radiohead. So last year I decided it was time to give them a listen, as, by the law of averages (I like Muse, Placebo, The Cure), they should be my sort of band. OK Computer was the second Radiohead album I bought after Amnesiac.\nLike many other people I found that I didn\'t quite see how it could be rated so highly. I thought it was good, but not \'one of the best ever\' good. So, I continued to listen to it. And it grew on me of course. In a way, some songs became a sort of soundtrack to my life. I lived by them, listened to them over and over again. And they continued to grow on me. So I decided to dig deeper and analyse the concept of OK Computer. And what I found made the album grow on me further. The dehumanization and constraints of society and progress. You listen to the lyrics, listen to the sounds which they have placed beneath it all, listen to everything that you can possibly hear, and then do it all again. And then the overwhelming pain sets in: \'What has happened to our world where we live our lives how we\'re told by the powers that be?\' ""Fitter Happier"" sums it up best I suppose. Sure, it can be discarded as a meaningless piece of filler, but it\'s actually anything but. That two minutes of computerized vocals and melodramatic piano is OK Computer. It is the core of the album. That\'s why it separates the first half from the second half. So don\'t just skip it every time. Listen and think.\nNow, getting past that, this album is a true masterpiece of intelligence and talent. It\'s comfortable, yet frantic. Peaceful, yet conflicted. The simplicity of songs such as ""Let Down"" and ""No Surprises"" is so confronting that it hurts. It lowers your spirits and makes your heart ache, while still making you feel so happy and grateful that you could hear a piece of music that can make you feel that way. Whether another band will be able to compete with this album in this genre ever again is unlikely. It seems that even Radiohead won\'t be able to. This album is the apex of the britrock genre. Listen to it, and appreciate the fact that you have been blessed with the ability to listen to it.\n\nBest Three Tracks From OK Computer(if you can name three standouts!)\n1. Let Down\n2.

has9,"[""it is absolutely tough for me to still imagine how 7600 random people who rated this album give an average of 4.41 rating, i mean its almost impossible, impossible in the sense that this album has such musical and emotional depth that i can hardly convince myself that all these people would connect to this album so easily, i mean i would understand if 80% of the people would say that they love the Beatles and their hum able songs but this one is hardly anywhere close to that, it actually took me a long time to get used to this album and then love it and then feel the depth that it carries. I bought this one at the time when i was going through a very depressing time and probably thats the only time when anyone could possibly like/love this album. I would even go on to say that somehow in a strange way Kid A is much more catchier than this album, I repeat 'catchy' maybe not an easier listen but that album stick in your head more than this one.\n\nFor me this album and the Pink Floyd's 'The Division Bell' opened the gates to a whole new world, how music draws new emotions. There are couple of really intellectual songs like 'Karma Police' and 'Climbing Up the Walls' mixed with really really emotional songs like 'Exit Music' and 'Lucky' and sad song like 'no surprises' this is a milestone when it comes to my passion in music, after listening to this album for straight 6 months (and nothing else), i remember that everything that i heard on tv and radio would sound pale (even sour).\n\nstill hard for me to imagine that Radiohead is selling so many cd's and loved by so many, makes me doubt if those fans are actually fans or just posers !""]",5.00 stars

LenBarker,"['One of my college roommates used to make fun of another roommate for buying Radiohead\'s first album, Pablo Honey, on the strength of the single ""Creep"". The dismissive derider thought that Radiohead was clearly a one hit wonder on the tail end of the grunge phenomenon and would never be heard from again. Although I liked ""Creep"" well enough, I never bothered to listen to the album nor did I muster a counterargument. For all that I could tell, he was right.\n\nA little while later, I heard a different acquaintance\'s copy of their second album, The Bends, and was shocked by how good it was, but I was too proud to go out and buy my own copy of it, because I didn\'t respect this dude\'s taste in music enough to allow myself to be so directly influenced by him! So I continued to resist becoming a Radiohead fan until I heard the undeniably great ""Karma Police"" and ""Paranoid Android"" and just had to finally purchase this wonderful CD. I still remember where and when I made that purchase and recall that day whenever I pass by the store, a big box next to an interstate where I pulled over on a whim, on road trips.\n\nIn short, OK Computer is absolutely deserving of its reputation as the Dark Side of the Moon of the \'90s.\n\nMore specifically, we get a great intro a la ""Speak To Me""/""Breathe""/""On the Run"" in ""Airbag"" that establishes some themes while not blowing us away, but building up the anticipation with chord progressions and arrangements bringing unresolved tension. Then on to the main feast: on Dark Side we got the soaring, epic ""Time"", and here we get something arguably even better: ""Paranoid Android"" is one of the greatest prog rock tracks ever produced (whether Radiohead actually likes prog or not!). I love the loose feel of the acoustic guitars throughout the early part of the song and Colin Greenwood\'s playful groove on the bass, and, as usual, Thom sings the hell out of this one (And the lyrics! ""Kicking, screaming, Gucci little piggie!"" Hell, yes.), but this all still just build up for the guitar riffage/carnage to follow; Jonny Greenwood\'s Lovetone Meatball effect on the guitar solo absolutely kills.\n\nWith gut-punches from ""Time"" and ""Paranoid Android"" coming so soon after the album\'s introductions, do both of these albums peak too early? A case could be made for that, but they both attain great heights later, too, and function beautifully as cohesive listening experiences, so I tend to think that the albums probably flowed best with these tracks in their respective places. And flow is a key similarity here, in that both albums are better than the sum of their parts by virtue of the fact that they are both such superb bodies of work in their coherence and listenability on the whole (even when they\'re bringing on some serious depression!).\n\nAfter the respective epics, the albums continue to flow in similar directions for now as we get a bit of a break in the action on both albums and mellow out a bit with ""The Breathe Reprise"" at the end of ""Time"" and ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" on Dark Side and ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"", ""Exit Music (For a Film)"", and ""Let Down"" on OK Computer. It is interesting how both ""Great Gig"" and ""Exit Music"" develop, dazzle, and dissolve in similar fashion, both moving the listener in similar fashion due to the expert song-craft employed by these two amazing bands.\n\nNext we get the albums\' ""big hits"" in ""Money"" and ""Karma Police"". Beyond that distinction, there\'s really not much of an honest comparison to be made between these tracks, but we continue to see how similarly the albums flow anyway. And there\'s still plenty left to enjoy on both of these albums, as we get moving slow songs about forms of isolation in ""No Surprises"" and ""Us and Them"".\n\nThe albums close in distinctly different fashions, much of this owing to the fact that Dark Side of the Moon is a concept album with musical themes that are reintroduced, rehashed, and resolved, whereas OK Computer continues to explore new musical directions. This aspect of the comparison also feeds into the whole ""Dark Side of the Moon of the \'90s"" bit in that concept albums, while they are still being made, will probably forever be associated with the 1970s, the decade in which Dark Side of the Moon was released. If OK Computer had been a concept album, then the comparison probably would not have worked as well in terms of either its identity as a strong product of its times or of the widespread acceptance that it attained, which are absolutely essential for this comparison.\n\nIt is notable that OK Computer was obtained and enjoyed by such a wide swathe of rock fandom, even as represented by my own group of friends, who have fairly divergent musical tastes, because that is the kind of popularity that made Dark Side of the Moon the cultural touchstone of its day, too. Just about everybody of certain ages who was into rock music at the time of these releases knows these albums and can be expected to be conversant on the topic, even if they don\'t like them. I once dated an older woman who was convinced that I was someone else who was posting online, merely because the other guy and I shared a mutual love of both Radiohead and Neil Young; she failed to understand how thoroughly unremarkable that is. Name any major rock act plus Pink Floyd or Radiohead, and fans who share a love for both of them are going to be common.\n\nSome may view it as a disservice to compare the albums in such direct fashion, especially since, despite the numerous comparisons, there is zero evidence that Radiohead was consciously aping or performing any sort of homage to Pink Floyd with this album, so let me be perfectly clear that I only intend to present this comparison on the basis of commonalities that both of these great albums happen to share and which have resulted in a frequently made observation that proves true under scrutiny. Radiohead definitely was not seeking to rehash any sort of \'70s prog; Jonny Greenwood reportedly does not even like Dark Side of the Moon. Relatively speaking, Radiohead, who had started off sounded like a mishmash of U2 in a grunge direction with greater chops in evidence than either of those institutions, was bringing something just as new and excellent (if not even greater) to the table as Pink Floyd had within the natural progression and context of their own musical abilities and influences.\n\nSo now that we have that comparison out of the way, so what? An album doesn\'t attain greatness in a vacuum, so it\'s worth examining how it changed the musical landscape, especially in the case of this particular album. The album\'s title represents an obvious concession to technology, but this is still in large part a guitar album, especially in comparison to the direction taken by the band later on Kid A and Amnesiac. Still, much was made of that title at the time, and techno, although it never really caught on in the States like the media claimed that it would, seemed poised to dominate with the guitar reportedly on the verge of extinction. Although that didn\'t happen, there definitely was a rash of successful Radiohead clones popping up like Doves, Travis, and Coldplay, so, in that respect, the album has continued to influence the charts, even though it never helped to usher in any sort of techno-age at all.\n\nHowever, although guitar driven rock directly influenced by this album remains with us, we may never see the likes of an album like OK Computer and its widespread acceptance throughout rock fandom and influence on fellow musicians again. With the popularity of music downloading having hurt physical rock album sales, it is evident that the dynamics of music sales have shifted appreciably, and more rock fans are taking the opportunity to less expensively explore their own preferred niches, making it far less likely that rock fans will come together over and fully absorb an album in such a fashion ever again.\n\nA few years after its release, some all-time-greatest-album lists placed OK Computer squarely at the top, and, although that has grown rarer, I still would not have a problem with it.']",5.00 stars
Equality,"['_OK Computer_: Radiohead took their successful rock sound of _The Bends_ and experimented with it. Now to a lot of people the word experimentation can be pretty scary, it means something new, something different, and oh my is that scary. However, experimentation sometimes fails, and sometimes it fails miserably, and unfortunately that is the case we have here. A reviewer for my school paper said this about this album: ""A technological bore, Not at all ok, computer."" If I may borrow that term I believe it characterizes this album perfectly, a technological bore.\n\nRadiohead took their rather unique style of British rock and layered it with so called ""soundscapes."" These soundscapes range from unnecessary, to annoying, to boring, with nothing good along. At times they are just used to heavily and interfere with the good playing going on beneath them. At other times when they\'re being used to establish a mood, they bore the listener and Thom Yorke could have done himself well to give his old Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream albums a spin before he created this to see how this technique is actually used. Atmosphere is a delicate thing, like baking a soufflé, and Radiohead yelped while this was in the oven.\n\nI find the use of many of these soundscapes to be completely unnecessary. Their melodic guitar work along with Thom Yorke\'s distinctive vocals give the music a dreamy nature alone, and the soundscapes just come off as excess. Though in some songs they hit it just right and it comes off pleasant (""Karma Police"" and ""Climbing Up The Walls"") but by no means essential to the song.\n\nThom Yorke voice is a bit, well it\'s certainly distinct, lets say that. It will annoy you at first, then it will grow on you, heck you might even start to like it, but it will never become one of those voices you love. You certainly don\'t want to hear anything a cappella from this man. The alum has some very strong moments even after its clunky start with ""Airbag."" ""Paranoid Android"" starts out with a very brooding atmosphere until it eventually explodes into a very enjoyable angsty rocker. ""Exit Music"" and ""Let Down"" are two emotional pieces that listeners on anti-depressants should avoid. But the rest of the album comes off unmemorable(""No Surprises"") or unlistenable(""Tourist"").\n\nA prime example of an artist losing its footing and being swept away by experimentation. I feel too many people are hyped into giving this album a five star rating. It certainly has its flaws, but it also has its moments. Radiohead did better with _The Bends_ and its probably best for everyone to start and stay there.']",3.50 stars

arashbahrami,"['The greatest album ever (although I would say the same thing for Amnesiac too)!\n\nAirbag: (8.5/10)\nA great intro to the best album ever! Get you prepared for Paranoid Android!\n\nParanoid Android: (10/10)\n\nA symbol of a classic Radiohead song! This song is usually considered as the best song of Radiohead, although for me is one of the best. The most popular song of Radiohead consists of three independent songs joint together delicately. The beginning part is an awesome classic rock song, and then it becomes a hardcore rock following by one of the best melody drum ever made, and at the end hardcore again. The song was initiated when Thom was in a messy bar in LA surrounded by annoying people (as you can also guess from its video clip, although the character in the video clip is “Robin” made by a Swedish director Magnus Carlsson). Kicking and squealing gucci little piggy refers to a fat woman getting on Thom’s nerve in that bar.\n\nSubterranean Homesick Alien (8.5/10)\n\nA good song! I can’t tell anymore about this one. Usually the there are a couple of songs in Radiohead albums at the beginning that are preparing you for more excitement! I think this song is one of them!\n\n\n\nExit Music (for a film) (10/10)\n\n\nA wonderful drum song! Originally written for Romeo and Juliet movie, the lyrics penetrates under your skin. There are some parts in the song that you really want to scream and cry. Specially when the song gets more exciting: You can laugh, a spineless laugh , and then my favorite part of the songs comes up:\n\nWe hope your rules and wisdom choke you …\n\nOverall I think it’s the best drum song of Radiohead played by guitar.\n\n\nLet Down (10/10)\n\nHysterical and useless! Simply the best! You have to listen to this song more and more and you love it more and more! Just go to the busy part of the town, and walk around! Look at the people around you and listen to this song.\n\nOne of the good things I love about this song is that it gets better and better as it goes. My favorite part is the last section of it:\n\nYou know, you know where you are with,\nYou know where you are with,\nFloor collapses, Floating, Bouncing back and one day\nI am gonna grow wings\nA chemical reaction\nHysterical and useless\n\n\nKarma Police (10/10)\n\nThis is what you get when you mess with us! This song is probably the most famous song of Radiohead after Creep.\n\nI haven’t seen anyone listen to this song for the first time and don’t agree that it’s a wonderful song! So it’s the best song if you want to introduce Radiohead to the beginners!\n\nHowever when you get involved in Radiohead more, you don’t listen to it much often, the same thing about Creep too! Because they are different from other Radiohead songs! They are wonderful rock songs, however different from other songs! They are the best for the follower groups of Radiohead (Coldplay, travis, Muse, Kean, …) to have an idea how to write a song, but they can never get close to it. As Chris Martin (Coldplay singer) says about the new era of Brit rock: “I think if you imagine Radiohead going through a jungle clearing a path, then we\'re the ones who are probably just criminally paving it. I always see Radiohead as the braver people.""\n\n\n\nFitter Happier: (8.5/10)\n\nThis is probably the weirdest song in OK Computer. Although there is some music in the background, the song is mostly influenced by the lyrics. All the shit that we have to care everyday, we hear it in TV, radio, reading in magazines, newspapers...\nAnother interesting thing about this song is that in the whole song you think you have to do what the computer like preacher is telling you. But at the end the sentence comes:\n\nLike a pig, in a cage, on antibiotics\n\n\n\nElectioneering: (8/10)\n\nIt is a good hard rock song! But I am not a huge fan of it!\n\n\nClimbing up the walls: (9.5/10)\n\nThis song has gained lots of attractions among Radiohead fans. It’s different from other songs of the album, but I would say Electioneering is a good intro to this song. The rhythm and the lyrics of the main part usually remain in your mind for a while if you listen to this song for a few times.\n\nNo Surprises: (9/10)\n\nI really feel I’m the guy Thom is talking about:\n\nA heart that’s full up like a landfill,\n\nA job that slowly kills you\n\nBruisers that won’t hill\n\nThe lyrics in this song is extremely depressing, however the music itself is not that depressing compare to other songs like Tourist, Exit Music, and Lucky in this album. The instrument that is used in this song is Glockenspiel. One of the songs that is good to present to Rookie Radiohead listeners.\n\n\nLucky (9.5/10)\n\nThis is a great drum song composed just in a couple of days for the album War Child. This album was created by various artists for the children of war in Bosnia.\n\n\nTourist (9.5/10)\n\nThis song is mostly composed by Johny. It was inspired when the group was in Paris and they saw tourists (specially Americans) passing by at thousand feet per second without noticing the marvelous beauty of Paris and it made Johnny crazy:\n\nHey man slow down, slow down\n\nIdiot, slow down, slow down\n\nThis is a perfect song for ending the best album in the history! Usually the last song of Radiohead albums are different from the others and usually are welcomed by a wide-rang of music tastes. Street spirit was like this in The Bends.']",5.00 stars

I was friends with the station's Music Director, and I remember him mentioning to me in the Spring of '97 that Radiohead had a new album coming out soon that he heard great things about. I still only knew Radiohead as a one-hit wonder, and had heard very little about them since Creep (which I liked). After returning to school and my beloved radio show the next fall, I don't remember even seeing a new Radiohead album on the rotation. The real radio station in our area, 97X (later known as woxy.com) did not play OK Computer. I never heard anything about this album until 2000 or 2001, when it began to gain its legendary status.\n\nMy own rating of this record has gone up and down over the years. I like it, but it's not a record I ever reach for or get a strong desire to listen to. I got more into Radiohead after Kid A came out, and I went back and listened to OK Computer. I have since realized something about Radiohead. Their albums sound really great the first time, but they don't seem to age well.

Piwi,"['The Bends might have been one of the ninetie\'s best guitar rock albums but taking into account the mediocrity of Pablo Honey[/i) Radiohead in 1997 were only ever a ""band to watch"". However from the moment OK Computer was put into C.D players across the country it pushed Radiohead into that spot where only few artists reach.\nThe album\'s opener is arguably the most powerful track on the album. From the moment \'Airbag\' starts you realise you are listening to something completely new and fantastic. This follows with \'Paranoid Android\' which remains to this day one of Radiohead\'s most experimental and ambitious (no pun intended) tracks. While \'Subeterranean Homesick Alien\' is undoubtedly the album\'s low point it still contains some of the most interesting Radiohead lyrics written. This is answered with \'Exit Music (for a Film)\': an incredibly dark account of the last scene to Romeo and Juliet and the album\'s high point. The following \'Let Down\' is a feel good song which would have fitted on one of Radiohead\'s former albums and \'Karma Police\' is the most accessible and catchy songs on the album. After \'Fitter Happier\' : a short \'poem\' said in a Stephen Hawking like voice, we have a quick return to the rocky guitar sound of the earlier albums with \'Electioneering\'. This is then answered by \'Climbing up the Walls\': another dark track which sees Thom Yorke even scream towards the end of the track.\nNo Surprises is disputedly Radiohead\'s greatest moment with its plinky-plonky guitar riff and glockenspeill. Its comments on nineties life, as well as the mixture of light guitar riffs and dark lyrics sum up this album brilliantly. Lucky is another song that uses guitar spectacularly yet this time it is softer and more meaningful. The final track, The Tourist contains some of the best lyrics on the album and is a chilling end to a chilling album.\nThis album is undoubtedly Radiohead\'s best and will probably never be bettered by the now heavily abstract band. OK Computer is simply fantastic. Its dark themes inlude comments on the pre-millenium world: office jobs, computers and mobile phones. Radiohead\'s OK Computer was predicted to be the last proper rock album ever as the world fast became engulfed by techno sounds and napster.

The playing is tight, the pieces fit so well; while the band doesn\'t sport fantastic guitarists, they make the most of the ideas (and pedals) they brought. ""Paranoid Android"" is a fine example: save the unexplained shift to human/Moog lamentation at the 3:35 mark, it\'s a clinic in merging several concepts into a unified theme.\n\nAnd much as I hate to admit it, the LP itself is much the same. Glistening, yearning pieces like ""Subterranean Homesick Alien,"" ""Let Down,"" and ""Airbag"" (the last too grand for the other tracks, but a shocking good opener nonetheless) coalesce with forlorn suburban headclutchers like ""Exit Music"" and ""No Surprises"".

I really think that had Radiohead stuck to that formula, nobody would have minded too much. Everyone (or nearly everyone) would have been perfectly happy with The Bends II. And The Bends would have just been regarded as their best album.\nInstead, they made this record. Adding prog rock, post rock and post punk (though there was some of that earlier) influences to their sound, as well as a lyrical concept that perhaps feels even more significant and prescient than it did at the time.\nIt's a masterpiece - rarely do music and lyrics mesh so well, rarely do the lyrics of a band feel like lasting insights - and one of the great records of the 1990s. It outdoes The Bends on every level (one would have thought that an impossible feat) and established Radiohead as something much more than just a Brit Pop band (unduly) influenced by Grunge.\nIt's not their best record, in my mind (which sounds insane given the praise I just gave it) but it's very close, and it's as essential as any '90s rock album.""]",5.00 stars

Eclipsey,"['This is the first Radiohead album i was able to listen from the beginning to the end. At my first listen, i didn\'t like many tracks from it, like Airbag, Electrictioning and Fitter Happier. At that time i was only into the darker tracks such as Lucky and Exit Music. But now i pretty much appreciate each single minute of this album, and i guess it made me change my idea about the ""heavier"" rocking songs (Red by K.C. made me loose a lot of some of my prejudices against more fast and ""noisy"" songs as well). Songs that i once couldn\'t stand like Airbag coz i once considered to noisy are now definitely necessary to listen imo to appreciate the album entirely.\n\nI love the dark and a lot of times melancholic tone of this album. Even Kid A can\'t be ""darker"" in my opinion, and the creepy tracks from it are genuine artworks. Lucky is so touching that it became my favorite Radiohead song, and the progressive track Paranoid Android is so eargasmic that i doubt any Radiohead fan in this world wouldn\'t have loved it at the first listen.\n\nAirbag starts already rocking (with soft and suave vocals by Thom, though) and making your hair reach the ceiling with those great basslines and background sounds, in an unforgetable intro that is as amazing as the intro of King Crimson\'s album Red, and its instrumental is really strong and enjoyable. It does make a superb pair with the next track, Paranoid Android, which would be their progressivest song, divided in 4 parts:\n\nThe first part starts very tranquil, making a good usage of acoustic tones and soft vocals. Then it slowly progresses into a heavier part, and at the moment Thom says ""you\'ll remember, you\'ll remember!!"" (best radiohead moment IMO, and it is even better in the live versions, since he actually screams at that part) the song shows his second face, a stronger heavier one with a guitar work that isn\'t 3rd grade as someone once qualified the guitarrist\'s playing in this album. After the ""angry"" part, a sad and melancholic tone arrives at your ears, with very touching vocals by Thom, and amazing backing vocals as well. After it, face 2 comes again and finishes the song with 5 stars, leading to the next great tune...\nSubterranean Homesick Alien starts very trippy, with great guitar notes flowing with Thom\'s again soft vocals and neat keyboard arrangements. This song creates a great atmosphere, it is indeed very strong in terms of how you feel when listening to it. You can easily appreciate the complexity of its instrumental and Thom\'s vocal work, which become a bit melancholic at the second vocal section of the song.\nTalking about melancholic, the next track does make some tears born from your eyes...Exit Music was a music done for a movie and it starts as a guitar solo with the sad vocal work, then it gets a slide guitar section until the end that reminds me a lot of the live versions of Celestial Voices by Pink Floyd.\nI don\'t enjoy the next track too much, Let Down is a nice one, and it is good since it makes the mood of the album a bit more shiny, but it doesn\'t lose its melancholy tone mainly in the vocals, which return in total power in Karma Police, another great Radiohead success from this album.\nFitter Happier is interesting, scary, it is nice to listen to the robot talking with those creepy background instrumentals, a nice song, nothing so much special about it, though...it is just different and therefore original.\nAnd then Electionnering comes, the most heavy one from the album, it is a good track, i once disliked it, but it surprisingly grew on me, as i said before, i am losing my restrictions against heavier rocking songs.\nWe then travel to Climbing up the Walls. Is it just me or does this song have some elements for their other good album Kid A? It really fits in Kid A\'s style, except for the noisy part which is more rocky than what would look nice on Kid A. Anyway, it is another song that can be appreciated, it is creepy as most of the album, and since it is creepy i really like it, heheheh...\nEr..ok...i guess it is time to take a nap with the next song...No, don\'t shoot me ok? I\'m not saying the next song is boring, i am saying that it has one of those ""go sleep child"" songs feel, it is a very sweet song, very beautiful and one of the first ones i listened to when i started my Radiohead fan-craziness. Thom again makes some beautiful and soft vocals here, hell, the guy is one of the best vocalists ever!!\nNow let\'s talk about Lucky. Beautiful song? No. It is much more than this: this is (IMO) OKC\'s best song, and it is not only beautiful... it is VERY beautiful, sad, wrist cutting and tear producer track. It has 3 sections, one with the trippy instrumental and Thom\'s trippy vocals, another just like the first one but with a very well done choir at the back of the song and a last one just like the second one, but without Thom\'s voice. There\'s an awesome guitar solo between the second and third parts, that progresses to part 3 with the great choirs which sound a bit differently now, shorter and less sad.\nAnd then there\'s The Tourist, a great track too, with a sad tone almost as deep as the track before it\'s one. It\'s a great finalé for a great album, which ends here... ;_;\n\nSo, this is by far my favorite Radiohead album, their most trippy, touching, complex and musically agradable in my opinion, and it is much more appreciated if listened to entirely, not like The Bends, where it can also be enjoyed by listening to the tracks isolated.']",5.00 stars

Tezcatlipoca,"['I don\'t think the album is perfect but it sure immerses you in an alien universe of its own making for one of the most cohesive sounding albums of the 90\'s. And I do love the sonic textures in ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"", ""Let Down"" and ""Exit Music"", better still is that this trio appears in a row. The rather unbalanced ""Climbing Up the Walls"" is definitely also a highlight.']",3.50 stars
X_Y_Z,"['I always used to find Radiohead dull when I was a casual music fan. I heard that “Karma Police” and “Paranoid Android” were two of their better songs, but when I listened to them I just found them plain dull. Then after getting sucked into the world of music more and more (probably about a year later), I gave those two songs another listen and was struck by how much I enjoyed them this time round. I was anxious to get my hands on a copy of the whole _OK Computer_ album and hear more of Radiohead’s stuff.\n\nIt’s a bit clichéd to say that this album is the best of the 90s or even the best of all time, but for me personally, there are only a select few albums that I prefer (any which I rate 5 stars). Most albums I might listen to for a few days after getting them, but I could not stop listening to this for a couple of weeks. “Paranoid Android” and “Karma Police” are two amazing songs which are almost flawless and while it is based around a common theme, there are songs with very differing tones like “Subterranean Homesick Alien” and “Exit Music (For a Film)”. As this is so hyped it’s one of those which everyone needs to hear, whether you hate it or love it.\n\nWhy does it not get five stars from me then? I like it but there’s something about it that is preventing it getting the highest possible rating. “Paranoid Android” and “Karma Police” are perfect from start to finish, but while there aren’t any bad songs, a lot of them have parts that are amazing, but also parts that are dull and boring. Still an amazing album, but not quite on a five star level.']",4.50 stars

And i think it is decent but not Brilliant. The album starts of magnificently with three outstanding tracks ""airbag"", ""paranoid Android"" and ""subteranial homesick alien"". ""let down"" and ""climbing up walls"" are both amazing. however the rest of the album is mainly tiresome and dull. Though you have to realise the importance of this album.

I\'m just mad that people actually think Radiohead is crap.\n\nI will admit it takes a liberal mind to like them.

Some might call this album depressing but I seriously don\'t find it to be so; it actually lifts my spirit every time I hear it...even ""No Surprises"" gets a smile out of me.\n\nEvery song on here is a highlight except Fitter Happier; it\'s an interesting track but not one I could listen to again and again. _OK Computer_ certainly lives up to it\'s ridiculous hype and I have and will happily listen to it for a very long time.']",5.00 stars
stanger,"[""Ok Computer,the 3rd album from Radiohead.Is it better than the bends?Well i would have to say YES and scream it out passionately because i have no doubt about it that this album is better than the Bends.Which to be honest is a huge achievement because the bends is a near perfect album,but this is a perfect album.Not only are the songs all flawless but the meanings behind the songs always keep you coming back for more.\n\nThe album i feel is quite distanced from anything on the bends and its fair to say that the songs are more complex.''Paranoid Android''is a perfect example of this and i can see why people call it a modern Bohemian Rhapsody with better lyrics.Never before have i seen an album that bursts with classic and famous songs like this does,maybe Nevermind comes near but when listening to ok computer you have a feeling that you have heard it somewhere before,a sure winner then. examples of this are the beautiful intro to ''No surprises'',The Guitar work in ''Paranoid Android''and the chorus in ''Karma Police''.\n\nI really cant emphasize how much this needs to be in your collection,it is more than an album,it is the best album ever created.The meaning,the vocals,the talent-it is perfect.My favorite album ever?......why go on then.My other favorite albums i may like but non-convey this emotion or imagery,Ok Computer should really be in the Louvre museum In Paris,it is art of the highest form and i could talk about this album more and draw more meaning from it than i could with any painting.\n\nIf you liked the bends buy this and then Love Radiohead and swallow up the whole collection like hundreds of others before have,something i will do myself very soon.""]",5.00 stars
dempsey,"[""British music seems to fall into two categories: the DIY camp that brought us punk and the 'it came out of art school' camp that is clearly the home for Radiohead. While _OK Computer_ may have been a revelation to 15 year olds anyone who has been listening to music (other than standard radio content) for any period of time has already heard the styles that are melded together here. So it isn't the unique work of art that it was claimed to be. The vocals could be called anguished but to these ears Yorke is simply whining for the most part and is the weakest part of the music. Also no-one in the band is going to win a best of instrument on any polls in the near future. So much for the down side.\n\n_OK Computer_ does work. It stands up to repeated listens which is more than most music released today. When Yorke does let loose he actually has a decent voice. And the songs (dare I call them songs?) - the musical pieces are kept interesting by Yorke's quirky arrangements, obtuse lyrics and use of non-pop sounds. The sum is greater than the parts.\n\nAn interesting work that isn't the saviour of music but does give some tired ears hope in this cookie cutter 'idol' culture.""]",3.50 stars

Guitarstudtx,"[""8 out of the 12 songs are solid solid solid.\n\nThe album starts out with the highly underrated 'Airbag.' The guitar's really drive this song and Greenwood's ambient almost egyptian sounding guitar solo is purely amazing. The screeching, sonic like sounds that are incorporated into this song at the end are worth the listen alone...'Paranoid Android' follows and the word classic is all that needs to be said. Next we have 'Subterranean homesick alien' which I thought to be very vague, repetitive and lacking energy. 'Exit music for a film' is a sad accoustical piece that was recorded for the film 'Romeo and Juliet.' The song starts out slow and a bunch of eerie noises are incorporated towards the end which gives the song alot of energy and really transform the listener into the world of the capulets and montagues. 'Letdown' is one of the most soothing and uplifting tracks of this album. The guitar work is among the most melodic that I think i've ever heard. The song works towards an amazing buildup that will blow the listener away. 'Karma police' is a mundane jazzy like piano piece that is slow and dry until the last 1:30 when things really pick up and become energetic and really fun! Another classic!\n\nThe second half is not as good as the first. 'Fitter happier' was definetly a filler. 'Electioneering' is probably the worst track on the album. I felt it was way too political. 'Climbing up the walls' is very eerie and it takes you to a very very very dark place. 'No surprises' is another melodic piece that uses a xylophone that sounds really cool. 'Lucky' is a great guitar piece with a really great solo. A choir piece is incorporated into the song and that really gives the song alot of feeling and energy. The last song, 'The tourist,' I felt to be somewhat of a letdown. There is no energy at all and it almost makes you want to fall asleep. Some people loved, i was one who HATED it.""]",5.00 stars
flyingbunny,"['One of the landmark albums of the 90\'s, and really, of all time. It showed that true concept albums were not dead, and there were still real statements to be made through the medium of rock that didn\'t have to do with depression and how much the world sucks and how we have to stick it to the man because he\'s out to get us. No, there\'s much more at work here on OK Computer, and it\'s actually probably worth saying.\nThe whole idea behind the album is that in our more and more computerized world, technology is getting a hold of us and many of us don\'t even realize it. We use everyday objects like TVs and computers, but don\'t realize we\'ve become a slave to the machines. We rely on them, and they can definitely be useful, as the lifesaving airbag in the first song. But if aliens from another planet were to see us and how we live, they\'d probably get a big kick out of seeing us, as described in ""Subterrainien Homesick Alien."" Sure, there are some of us who see the light and want to escape from the grip of all the reliance on technology, as in ""No Surprises,"" but there will always be the society that you must conform to, outlined in the eerie ""Fitter Happier."" The album ends wit ha ray of hope, but an overall sense of doom, warning us of our downfall if we continue this downward spiral we\'ve been taking the last several decades.\nNow, this is hard to say what the album really means. I gave you my interpretation. The lyrics on this album are incredibly vague, but that\'s good - it opens it up for intelligent discussion and even reform, if taken in the right way. The music, while tedious towards the end, is surprisingly good, and flows nicely. It sort of gets a backseat to the lyrics, but that too is alright because it\'s what Radiohead tried to do. They weren\'t trying to make a sonic masterpiece of rock and roll - they were trying to make a statement. And it probably succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.']",4.50 stars

keyser_soze,"[""This album is the best thing Radiohead have ever done, and that's for one reason and one reason alone; the songs. Not the words, which were what grabbed me on _Hail to the Thief_ and _Amnesiac_, or the music, which is what grabbed me on _Kid A_, but the songs as whole entities. If the songs are 'split down' into their component parts, there isn't much that's one-off special here; the riffs are better on _The Bends_, there aren't any songs that can touch 'A Wolf at the Door' (off _Hail..._) lyrically, even the tunes aren't always perfect. But when everything's put together, this is Radiohead at its most consistent.\nTake 'No Surprises', for instance, one of the best tracks on the album and a contender for the saddest Radiohead song of all time. On its own, the lyrics are poetic but not a masterpiece; the tune is sad, but not to the point that its going to make you cry. That only happens when the two get fused together; the lyrics fit perfectly with the music on everything presented here, something Radiohead haven't always been perfect at, and it is this, perhaps, that gives _OK Computer_ its feeling of consistence.\nThe other point that needs mentioning - in order to illustrate why this is arguably the most important rock record of the 90s - is 'Paranoid Android'. About the yuppies and fakers he met in LA, the song proved that an indie epic wasn't an oxymoron; and it contains the best Radiohead line ever, the bit about the 'kicking squealing Gucci little piggie'. A phrase which sums up the 90s and the mood of this record perfectly.\nOther stand-out moments include the fantastic last half of 'Karma Police', when after melancholic riffing the song suddenly expands into a vast operatic chorus with a little help from some Johnny Greenwood guitar magic; the riffs in 'Airbag' and 'Electioneering'; and the ultra-sad 'Exit Music (for a film)', which indeed was used as exit music in the film _Romeo and Juliet_, and so doesn't fit quite in with the tone of the record. If it did, it would undoubtedly be the best thing on there. That it isn't speaks volumes about just what a fantastic beast _OK Computer_ actually is.\nIf you don't own this record, make a move to rectify the situation. Now.""]",5.00 stars
unearth,"[""Just as Nirvana managed to popularize and refine punk rock with _Nevermind_, Radiohead's _OK Computer_ taps into the rich vein of experimental rock and breathes new life and mass appeal into it's often times elusive heart. Odd time signatures, ever-shifting dynamics, strange textures, and unfamiliar sounds co-mingle within the brilliantly layered production, creating a swirling, disorienting and unpredictably heady mix.\nRadiohead's music in general, and on this album in particular, seems to polarize music lovers. Their music is without a doubt dark, alienating, and rather elitist in its avant-garde tendencies. It seems that one's opinion of the music is based on what type of sounds their ears are attuned to. Someone weened on radio-friendly hits will probably not be moved by this music. What makes Radiohead great is their conscious evolution as artists and the fact that they seem to have absorbed the entire history of popular and underground music, ably transmuting it into a new and highly personal style. With _OK Computer_ they have cracked open the stubborn shell of expectation, and revealed the myriad possibilities that lie within.""]",5.00 stars

waywardraven,"['Where do i begin? The sheer enormity of this record has blessed the ears of a generation, and surely those to come.\n\nThe songwriting power of Thom Yorke, mixed with the adaptation and creativity of the other band members makes for an unprecidented and unbelievable collage of brilliantly orchestrated songs. I\'ll go through the album step by step.\n\nTrack one:Airbag, quite possibly the best opener in the history of Rock, is a buzzy, upbeat and poppy song about Thom Yorke\'s car accident. Quite spacey lyrics and sound, especially the line ""I\'m back to save the universe"". This song is the most accesible, therefore a good opener to skeptical listeners.\nTrack two:Paranoid Android, the most widely associated song with this album, it has elements of spanish percussion and other things that cannot even be classified. Possibly the hardest song on the album, excluding electioneering, it has a distinct, angry tone to it, without becoming obnoxious.\nTrack 3: Sub. Homesick Alien, Ah... this song is about an alien\'s point of view, looking upon earth and talking about how ""uptight"" we are. Gorgeously harmonic.\nTrack 4:Exit Music (For a Film), This song is very eerie and haunting. The lyrics are graphic (""We all hope you choke"") and seem to express great anguish. It reminds me alot of 2+2=5 for some reason.\nTrack 5: Let Down. This is the best song ever made. The spacey, eerie but poppy droning guitar and effects throw you in to a whirl of sensory enigmas. The end is especially amazing, the twinkling sound fades away into the next track\'s prominent piano.\nTrack 6: Karma Police, One of the most popular songs on the album. It shows the keyboarding strengths of the band, amoung other things. In my opinion, it is as if it\'s about a man, stepping out to look at his life from another person, then saying \'arrest this man, he talks in maths\' or that he talks complicated, and can\'t relax. This balled is one of Yorke\'s masterpieces.\nTrack 7:Fitter Happier. It is more of a collage of soundbytes with an eerie backdrop than a song, mocking our everyday pet peeves.\nTrack 8: Electioneering. Just a basic rock song, and some say the weak point on the album. It doesnt fit as well as the others with the tone of the album.\nTrack 9: Climbing up the Walls: The most eerie and creepy song. It\'s lyrics imply that the character is waiting inside the victims house, but it never is clear. Not a song to listen to alone at night.\nTrack 10: No suprises. A brilliant but sad song with high guitar and low bass at the beginning, for an ironic twist of contrast.\nTrack 11:Lucky. A very sad song with profoundly depressing atmosphere.\nTrack 12: The Tourist. God, they just had to go out with a bang. An closer of epic proportions.\n\n\nSo there you have it.

trout217,"['I’d never thought much of Radiohead in the past, yet upon hearing from a friend that their latest single was quite interesting in a progressive kind of way and after seeing the video for ‘Paranoid Android’ one night, I was intrigued. Here was a single like no other, six and a half minutes long, with numerous sections and changes, intertwining acoustic guitars and Latin percussion kick off with the opening lyrics ""Please can you stop this noise, I’m trying to get some rest from all the unborn chicken voices in my head"". This leads into a extremely funky and catchy little progression on acoustic with a squashed flat Rhodes piano in the background which then kicks into a full-on assault with screaming, piercing guitar solos then it’s over. For a moment. Then out of the rubble rises layered voices and grainy mellotron choirs, like a rock ‘n’ roll Russian Orthodox mass, which builds and builds until we’re back into the screaming solos, this time complete with swooping analogue synth squelches and noise and then the whole thing lurches to a dead stop. I’d read rave reviews of the album _OK Computer_, so I had to check it out, and I couldn’t fault it. This album is an instant classic.\n\nThe band has left no stone unturned in their quest for interesting sounds. This is not the simple guitar pop of ‘Creep’. Musically, the band has matured immensely. Favourite moments being the clipped and compressed drum loops of ‘Airbag’, the fuzz bass with it’s voice breaking and huge emotional climax of ‘Exit Music (For A Film)’ and the eerie, layered and distorted vocals and screams of frustration and despair unable to penetrate the thick white noise, screaming violins and relentless hollow snare in ‘Climbing Up The Walls’. It’s clear from the lyric sheet that Thom Yorke has a fairly bleak vision of humanity and the monsters that we have created and are seemingly out of control. Yorke, it seems, is wrestling with those paradoxes intrinsic to a modern society unsure of and a little anxious as to what the future holds. This is a vision which no doubt resonates with a lot of people as this album is incredibly popular and is surely one of the defining musical and lyrical statements of the late 90’s.']",5.00 stars
LaLaLaLaLemon,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '""Okay. Computer!"" - Zaphod to Eddie, The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nI had to start with an OK Computer and Hitchhiker\'s Guide comparison. I\'m sorry, I just had to. But in my opinion, this is the best album of all time and it didn\'t even need references to the world\'s greatest book to help it either.\n\nThis was the second Radiohead album I heard and I fell in love with it instantly. The main reasoning being this: Thom Yorke has a very unique voice that I just want to make love to for all eternity. Oh, and the musicianship is also better than most bands. Jonny Greenwood is more talented than most people in just a one little strand of hair found somewhere between his knee and ankle.\n\n""Exit Music (For a Film)"", ""Paranoid Android"", and ""Karma Police"" are my favorite tracks on the album. ""Paranoid Android"" is one of my favorite songs of all time and possibly even my number one. Sure, I have no idea what the song means, but does anyone? Every song on OK Computer in their right selves are masterpieces. Even ""Fitter Happier"". It fits where it is, connecting together the whole album which has a central theme of technology advancement in the society. Ironically, the song is about making oneself better sung (talked) by a computerized voice.\n\n""Airbag"" is a good opener for the album. Somewhat about a car accident he had in his life, but then he yelps out ""In an interstellar burst / I\'m back to save the universe"" and all I can see matter in the universe split in two and out flies Thom Yorke in a multicolored superhero outfit ready to save those who need it. I also like ""Electioneering"", which is another one of the songs that doesn\'t seem to get much love either. It\'s their hardest song and most rocking. The only problem I had with it is that ""I need more cowbell"".\n\nThom has said that the album doesn\'t have a concept at all. Even if there is or not, there\'s still that theme of technology soiling society throughout the album. They\'re trying to reach out to you to tell you that just step away from it all, even if it\'s for a little while. In ""The Tourist"", it\'s about people, tourists, not stopping to view the beauty wherever they are and just trying to quickly get through the place. And the only thing that\'s stopping them is the technology of the world.\n\nThat\'s how I see the album as being. I\'m not a deep thinker and probably took other people\'s ideas, but that\'s the way the world goes. All I can say is that OK Computer IS the best album of the 90s and also my favorite album of all time. As much as anyone who could somehow hate Radiohead, there will always be one major let down to them; no matter what happens, Radiohead will rule this planet earth forever.']",5.00 stars

It starts to sink after that, as the other songs can\'t live up to the first 2 tracks, but the album is still great. I won\'t give it 5 stars because of the POS track ""Fitter Happier"".

Pantagruel,"['It took me several listens before I could appreciate it, but I agree that OK Computer deserves all of the critical praise being heaped upon it. Though I don\'t fully see the concept link of this album, most of the songs provided a perfect backdrop for the Year 2000 scare. To be sure, it will probably go down as the most characteristic, but not necessarily the greatest, album of the \'90s. (I contend that it is not even the best from the class of 1997. That award, in my humble opinion, belongs to I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One by Yo La Tengo.) However, lists and rankings are of secondary importance. What really matters is the content and why Radiohead felt compelled to make this album.\n\nMany songs on OK Computer evoke a cold, cruel world where progress and technology have enslaved the human spirit. For all of the modern technological advances that were created to make our lives easier, we have become subservient to them. For example, can you recall a time when people did not carry around pagers and cell phones? We have become so dependent upon instant communication that it has exacted a toll, namely, that we have become disconnected with the world around us. We are not mature enough a society to fully handle our own creation. And, like the proverbial hamster in the cage, we work harder and faster to get nowhere.\n\n“Ambition makes you look pretty ugly,” sneers singer Thom Yorke on the “Bohemian Rhapsody” style “Paranoid Android.” Yet Radiohead is very ambitious on OK Computer. Not content with producing a disposable piece of merchandise like so many of their contemporaries, they want to make a meaningful album that actually contains some substance and, dare I say, something that can be considered as art.\n\nOK Computer has been dismissed by some as an imitation of Pink Floyd\'s 1970’s work. For example, the dark, psychological overtones in “Climbing Up the Walls” sounds like a companion piece to passages from The Wall. However, there is one noticeable difference between the two bands. Yorke infuses his lyrics with signs of humanity, a trait that was sometimes missing from Pink Floyd lead singer Roger Waters’ songs. Where Waters assumed the role of sanctimonious observer, Yorke takes on the persona of the Everyman. We side with Yorke because instead of condemning or passing judgment, he alternates between frustration and resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, the sonic landscape Radiohead creates does invoke Pink Floyd. Guitar textures abound, as does studio wizardry in the form of electronic beeps and noises. These sounds perfectly capture the thematic mood on which Yorke hangs his occasionally obscure lyrics.\n\nA mournful cello, as if playing at a requiem, opens the album, followed by the sound of sleigh bells as if someone’s Christmas wish was answered. Entitled “Airbag,” Yorke sings with both awe and a feeling of invincibility at living through an automobile accident. Colin Greenwood’s percolating bass darts in and out like the sound of a heart beating rapidly.\n\nIn an interstellar burst\nI am back to save the universe\n\nIt is a circular argument that, in an album that sharply questions modern technology, if not for safety innovations, the protagonist in the song would not have survived. Of course, depending on how far back you consider technology an intrusion, if there were no automobiles, there would be no auto accidents in the first place.\n\nThe new lease on life offers Yorke and his mates a chance to view exactly what kind of a society we live in, and the answer is not pretty. Dreamy and ethereal, “Subterranean Homesick Alien” shares the uptight world Bob Dylan speaks of in his similarly titled classic. But here, Yorke ponders about what life would be like among extraterrestrials and how they must view us.\n\nAnd up above aliens hover\nMaking home movies for the folks back home\nOf all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits\nDrill holes in themselves and live for their secrets\n\nNotice that by song’s end Yorke does not state he wants to live with such aliens, only that he wishes to visit another world. Despite the monotony and triviality of our world, he still feels a connection to it.\n\nSince travel in an alien spacecraft must remain a fantasy, we are forced to confront life on Earth. Immediately catchy, “Let Down” belies the upbeat music. Yorke sings about “transport/ motorways and tramlines/starting and then stopping/taking off and landing”--numerous methods of transportation but nowhere to go and nothing to do once you get there.\n\nThe emptiest of feelings\nDisappointed people\nClinging onto bottles\n\nThe exhausted way Yorke sings those first lines embodies the blandness of daily life and the need to break free of the routine. When Yorke laments, “crushed like a bug in the ground,” he speaks for anyone stuck in a dead-end job, a dead-end relationship, a dead-end town, or a combination of the three. Yet, the music remains full of life, as if to say that things are never as bad as they appear. Eventually, it motivates Yorke, who vows to grow wings and break out of this rut. The ending keyboard piece reminds me of millions of morning commuters lining up for the train like so many ants on a trail.\n\n""Karma Police"" presents us with an authoritarian nightmare where conformity is the name of the game and individuality is swiftly eradicated. Yorke snaps out of it with the line “For a minute there/I lost myself,” admitting that it was all a terrible thought he dreamt up. Or was it? Upon closer examination, his voice echoes in reverb indicating his line of losing it might be the dream and that the Karma Police a real, Kafkaesque troop. That notion is reinforced when a guitar imitating a siren enters from the far right channel and hovers over the remainder of the song before whirring to a discomforting close.\n\nThe Orwellian ""Fitter Happier"" could well be the most chilling cut on the disc. (On the back of the CD, it is listed separately and in a smaller font from the other tracks.) The centerpiece of the album, it is a monologue spoken by, well, an OK computer. Phrases of conventionality are strung together giving the impression of a soulless, conforming life form. The Karma Police have succeeded in reprogramming this person to make him beneficial to society. The cacophonous score is a proper background for the words.\n\nFavours for favours\nFond but not in love…\nAt a better pace\nSlower and more calculated\nNo chance for escape…\nCalm\nFitter, happier, and more productive\nA pig\nIn a cage\nOn antibiotics\n\nIn an attempt to better himself by fitting in with society’s values, this person has had the individuality sucked right out of him and may as well be artificial.\n\n“Electioneering” is a straightforward, if obvious, song about how politicians will prostitute themselves in order to secure votes. During their campaign, they allow themselves to be manipulated by public opinion. Once in office, however, it is the politicians who pull the strings and betray the trust bestowed on them by voters. It is apparent that they are part of the problem, not part of the solution, and that any social reform must include a change in the way we elect government officials. The band plays fierce and tough on this number.\n\nIf “Karma Police” and “Fitter, Happier” are the two most totalitarian numbers on the album, then “No Surprises” is its most touching. Jonny Greenwood’s guitar plays like a lullaby throughout. But it is Yorke’s voice, tired and world-weary, that takes center stage. There is the allusion to “Electioneering” in a line about the government, but the opening verse is the focal point of the theme.\n\nA heart that’s/Full up like a/Landfill\nA job that slowly/Kills you\nBruises that won’t heal\n\nLiving in a world that has grown accustomed to modern conveniences and all its bells and whistles, we often fail to stop and enjoy the simple things in life, like a flower garden, or a warm handshake from a friend. At the close of this achingly beautiful song, the character is planning a quiet suicide to forever shut out the alarms and surprises that are killing him.\n\nOK Computer closes with the lovely ballad, “The Tourist.” Akin to “Subterranean Homesick Alien,” I picture the title character as outside of this world, and quite possibly outside of our time like a messenger from the future. Again, the lyrics are sung dreamily, as if in slow motion. On the final line, Yorke cries out, “Hey man, slow down, slow down/Idiot, slow down, slow down.” But he does not sing maliciously. “Idiot” is not meant as an insult, but as a respectful admonition, like calling someone “silly.” He wants us to pause for a moment, a long moment, take a deep breath, and evaluate exactly what kind of a world we have created with all of our technological toys.\n\n“Exit Music (For a Film)” is the one song that doesn’t fit the feel of this album. With a theme lifted from Romeo and Juliet (indeed, the song played over the closing credits of the 1996 film adaptation), it is a hushed, intimate encounter of two lovers running away from disapproving parents. It does an adequate job of capturing the naive sentiment of youth. However, its inclusion on the album and its parting shot, “we hope that you choke,” run counter to the rest of the tracks.\n\nA quick note on the artwork of the album. Stanley Donwood, who has been called the seen-but-not-heard member of Radiohead, designed it. A photo of a freeway intersection graces the cover but becomes blurry in the distance. In the upper right-hand corner is a picture sign that reads “Lost Child.” The commentary is that we have lost our way in the world we created. There are other figures on the cover, but they are just silhouettes—the body is there but the soul is missing. Inside the booklet are numerous visual references to the songs on the album, arranged to aid the listener into focusing on key lines.\n\nAt the conclusion of “The Tourist,” a timer goes off. Radiohead has finished cooking up its masterpiece. Your destiny is served.']",4.50 stars

fabbriciuse,"['Rimanevo di nascosto sveglio a contemplare il buio, aspettavo il silenzio assoluto - che i miei se ne andassero a dormire - per cogliere in lontananza il rumore di automobili che andavano chissà dove. Nel mio immaginario fanciullesco la notte era un formicaio di persone speciali, alieni che vagavano verso luoghi di vita vera, viaggiavano, si fermavano per parlare di quelle piccole meraviglie che già io cominciavo a dare per scontate. Qualche anno dopo ho smesso del tutto: ho rosicchiato la notte da entrambe le parti, ne ho smarrito quel sapore, ho capito che la gente, i posti, le strade sono gli stessi del giorno, con meno traffico, meno luce, meno rumore. Tutto qui.\nMa il sogno è risorto nel Luglio del 1997: attratto dal video di Karma Police, ho comprato Ok Computer, terza prova dei Radiohead, loro consacrazione dopo gli ottimi Pablo Honey del ’93 e The Bends del ’95. Attesissimo dai fans di tutto il mondo e dal mondo della musica in generale, Ok Computer non deluse le attese, anzi, cambiò il Rock e inventò un nuovo modo di fare musica. Pagine su pagine di riviste, libri, siti internet sono state scritte negli ultimi 6 anni per descrivere questo disco come uno dei più influenti di tutta la storia della musica, sicuramente l’album più importante degli anni ’90 insieme a Nevermind del quale rappresenta l’altra faccia della stessa medaglia, lo scontento di un’intera generazione senza più sogni ed ideali. La rivoluzione è nell’utilizzo del “computer” come mezzo per plasmare sensazioni al fianco degli strumenti tradizionali, l’Elettronica non fine a se stessa e figlia di una cieca fede nel progresso, unica e vera religione dell’Occidente, ma un’Elettronica schiava che alza la testa e si ribella (“…I am born again/In the neon sign/scrolling up and down...” da Airbag). Non credo di dover aggiungere altro a questo fiume di elogi “oggettivi” e vorrei esplorare il disco dal mio personalissimo punto di vista. Seduto sulla poltrona del salotto l’ho ascoltato in cuffia per la prima volta, ma non tutto. Mentre i miei erano lì a vedere un film e mio fratello giocava al computer, mi è bastato assaggiare le prime sei tracce, fino a Karma Police, libretto alla mano per leggere i testi-poesia, per rimanere stordito e decidere di riascoltarlo il giorno dopo, solo a casa, senza essere disturbato dal minimo rumore o agente esterno. Così, al secondo ascolto, ho capito cosa mi aveva lasciato senza parole la sera prima: dopo tanti anni in Ok Computer avevo ritrovato la mia infanzia, tutte quelle piccole meraviglie di cui era fatta, la mia magica notte popolata da uomini-alieni e anche l’inesorabile perdita di tutto ciò (“…Transport/Motorways and tramlines/Starting and then stopping/Taking off and landing/The emptiest of feelings...” da Let Down). Il disco, infatti, non parla direttamente di quel mio mondo perduto, evidentemente non solo mio ma di tutti, bensì della sua negazione, ovvero la falsa perfezione delle Democrazie Occidentali (“…Ambition makes you look pretty ugly/Kicking screaming gucci little piggy…” da Paranoid Android). Qua e là si scorge una luce (“…I’d show them the stars and the meaning of life…” da Subterranean Homesick Alien), una finestra su quella Notte Infinita, ma nel complesso il disco racconta piangendo la perdita dell’innocenza e il dolore che ne consegue. Cercando di inquadrarlo nell’arco della decennale discografia dei Radiohead, Ok Computer rappresenta infatti la dolorosa presa di coscienza dello status quo. Nei successivi e discussi album il poeta Thom Yorke cercherà di reagire con rabbia a questa trasformazione che avviene in ognuno di noi nel momento che diventiamo adulti, schiavi di una cultura forgiata per creare schiavi (“…Riot shields/Voodoo economics/It’s just business…” da Electioneering -non vi sembra attualissima?-), e lo farà a suo modo (modo che io ho condiviso e condivido ancora nell’ultimo e stupendo Hail to the thief). Ciò che rende però Ok Computer essenziale e indispensabile come disco, ma anche e soprattutto come “voce fuori dal coro” è il suo richiamare all’innocenza del bambino tutti noi figli di questo falso mondo-perfetto, in cui una stretta di mano nasconde l’inganno e la parola è sempre vuota di significato. Ciò che rende Ok Computer bellissimo è l’incarnazione di questa “voce fuori dal coro” in quella stupenda di Thom Yorke e il sapiente utilizzo di tutti gli strumenti, computer compreso, dal resto della band.\nCerte volte quando torno a casa tardi e tutti dormono, prendo dalla mensola dei cd la mia consumata e vissuta copia di Ok Computer e la inserisco nel lettore portatile. Chiudo gli occhi. In lontananza riesco ancora a sentire il rumore delle automobili degli alieni che vagano in cerca di quei luoghi di vita vera.']",5.00 stars
Bewilder,"['When Radiohead released ""Ok Computer"" in 1997, they had just been rehabilitated by their last record from being considered as a ""One-Hit-Wonder"". And although ""The Bends"" contained some (12 exactly)real great statements of modern Art Rock, nobody expected Radiohead to grow as big as they got with/after this album. ""In an interstellar burst/I´m back to save the universe"", Thom Yorke sings in the chorus of the very first song, ""Airbag"", not (yet) knowing how right he would be. What promise the final guitar bits of the song, is held by ""Paranoid Android""´s amazing solo: Here, a band is breaking through to the appreciated soundscapes of a new century. Not only by great guitar play (what, concerning Radiohead, wouldn´t play a role any longer on their next two albums) but the creation of a musical world of its own, involving Punk (""Electioneering""), Folk (""Exit Music (For A Film)""), Ambient (""Climb Up The Walls"") and Gregorian choir parts among other stile.

Most of the songs here are good, the only fillers being ""Electioneering"" (a jumbled mess) and ""No Surprises"" (very annoying). ""Fitter Happier"" shouldn\'t count as a strike against the album because its an interlude, not a real song. ""Airbag"" is a great intro, ""Subterreanean Homesick Alien"" and ""Let Down"" are two awesome laid-back tracks. The single ""Karma Police"" and the multi-part ""Paranoid Android"" are great. I particularly enjoy the climaxes on each (""Raiiiiin down from a great height"" on PA and the ""I lost myself"" section of KP). Overall, my favorite here is definitely ""Exit Music (for a Film) - talk about an emotional song. Unfortunately, Radiohead lost me after this album.

FloydWright,"['In my opinion, Radiohead has released a total of three noteworthy albums: _The Bends_, _Kid A_, and the album linking the two, _OK Computer_. Even though I believe that the current Radiohead might be creatively spent by now, do not let their recent mediocre output discourage you from trying this album. Yes, there does seem to be a bit of filler that you have to be in a specific mood for (""Fitter Happier"", ""Electioneering"", and ""No Surprises""), but even that is by no means worthless, and when you ARE in the mood, quite enjoyable. Overall, this is an extremely solid album that deserves every one of its 4.5 stars.\n\nMy favorite songs are the beautiful ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" (an ET\'s-eye view of us Earthlings), ""Let Down"", and the chilling ""Climbing up the Walls""). The eerie, siren-like noise at the end of that song is no synthesizer; in fact, it is several violins all slightly out of tune with each other, playing in unison. It\'s touches like that, that make this album what it is. This, and _The Bends_ will probably have the most mass appeal of Radiohead\'s three important albums, more so than their experimental masterwork, _Kid A_. I\'ve kept this review short because I think much of what can be said about _OK Computer_ has already been said. My final words are--don\'t mind the filler; pick this up anyway.']",4.50 stars

""Electioneering"" is a welcome shot of adrenaline, and ""Lucky"" may be the most underrated song in the Radiohead catalog (the lads might agree with that).

LuckyBob22,"['This is the album that every artist dreams that he or she can put out. Seeing as there are two-hundred other reviews on this site, just about everything that needs to be said has probably been said. I\'ll throw in my two cents, however.\nRadiohead\'s third album is still widely considered their best, with the perfect blend of their early rocking years (evident in such songs as the epic ""Paranoid Android"" or the scathing ""Electioneering"") and their more obscure later years (which can be felt just about everywhere on the album :). Other especially notable tunes are the Orwellian ""No Surprises,"" ""Let Down,"" and of course, ""Exit Music,"" my personal favorite, which gradually builds to a climax so powerful that it gives me goosebumps each and every time I hear it.""\nMore important than the quality of the music on the album is the quality of the atmosphere. Radiohead manages to take fear and embody it in music on _OK Computer_. Each song helps to paint a portrait of a world controlled by machines, not real machines, but _humans_ who have ""become"" machines. In the world of _OK Computer_, no one is happy or content, everyone is simply a cog in the larger wheel of government, and no one\'s business is their own business. This is even more relevant in these current times, where government intrusion into daily life is continually being encouraged and protected, and a government composition known as the Patriot Act remains in direct and blatant contradiction with the the Constitution of the United States of America.']",4.50 stars

Radiohead combine excellent british songwriting with krautrock-like experimenting and a healthy dose of vagueness in lyric.\n_Airbag_ immediately grabs you by the throat with guitar, cello and sleigh bells (!). Well, if that isn\'t a fascinating combination i don\'t know what is.\n_Electioneering_ is the only track out of place.

Gamefreak501,"['_Ok Computer_ is the second album I bought by Radiohead. Starting off with ""Airbag"", with drums especially showing through. It offers another great emotionally-detailed album that lives up to what _The Bends_ offered.\n\nIt is an almost different sound to the _The Bends_ in the best possible way, in fact, I like it just as much as _The Bends_. With the only downfall being on ""Fitter Happier"", a very electronic and robotic song, with some varied content, and very small instrumental content. It makes an excellent transition into the next very different sound of ""Electioneering""\n\n""Paranoid Android"" is like a visit to an entirely different world, in a sense compared to the first track. Lyrically strong, like all of Radiohead\'s songs. With one of the most compelling and beautituful synthesizer/keyboard parts that seem to blend in well with the vocals, and then set the way forward for the guitar to come back in. Then a great and sudden jolt into a completely different direction, which is not unwelcome, which opens up to some furious and good guitar playing then it goes somewhere completely different! But poweful in a calming way. Then back up to before, with fury.\n\n""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" almost sounds like lullaby music, with a mix of calming electric, almost sea-like noises with hints of tropicalness. Then Thom Yorke comes in with his equally pleasing lyrics. Sometimes with an ever so slight harshness alike U2.\n\n""Exit Music (for a film)"" is all about the vocals, at least to begin with, together with a very background and almost drowned out guitar. Building up to a choir-like background. Which then fades to a very distant sound thats hard to explain with still Thom Yorke showing through. Then comes in the drums and the heavy distorted guitar, while still ensuring the clarity of the vocals shows through. Then slightly faded to give the other instruments a chance, then faded again showing some final haunting lyrics all the way through.\n\n""Let Down"" starts off with a guitar element in it, then the drums then the vocals. Another very easily listenable song. It goes into a faded state towards the centre, then builds back up again. Finishing off in a calming way.\n\n""Karma Police"" is a song that bears some resemblance to some sounds of _The Bends_. It goes places aswell, sometimes getting gentler something not.\n\n""Electioneering"" is another _The Bends_ sounding song, harsh but still great.\n\n""Climbing Up The Walls"" is a typical _Ok Computer_ sounding track, almost Muse-like, but still quite easy all the same. Building into a slight ruthless sound at times. Opening the way for ""No Surprises""\n\n""No surprises"" was a song a lot of the songs on _Ok Computer_ all lived up to, and did a good job of living up to, it is lyrically perfect, and is in my favourites list for this album.\n\n""Lucky"" is also a calming trip. Fairly guitar driven, with vocals on top, also showing through pretty well. Ending quite abruptly to make way for the last track, ""Tourist"".\n\n""Tourist"" has a very gentle guitar beginning, with Thom Yorke\'s equally gentle vocals being used well here. The song goes places but doesn\'t rely on extreme but perhaps gradual change to do so.\n\nFull track listing:\n\n1. ""Airbag"" *****\n2. ""Paranoid Android"" *****\n3. ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" *****\n4. ""Exit Music (for a film)"" *****\n5. ""Let Down"" *****\n6. ""Karma Police"" ****\n7. ""Fitter Happier"" ***\n8. ""Electrioneering"" ****\n8. ""Climbing Up The Walls"" *****\n9. ""No Surprises"" *****\n10. ""Lucky"" *****\n11. ""The Tourist"" *****\n\nThis is a great album, just as good, if not better than _The Bends_ even if you haven\'t got anything by Radiohead, or don\'t even like them, I highly recommend this album, a magnificent show of the abilities of Radiohead as a band as well as their emotional and lyrical intensity!']",5.00 stars

This song mimics that of ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" by The Beatles on _The White Album_. It has three different parts; weaving through various sounds and time signatures. It is an epic song.\n\n""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" takes its name from the songs by Bob Dylan ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" from _Bringing It All Back Home_. This songs flows so perfectly. After he sings ""Uptight"" for the third time, the music somehow melds its way back to the original beat. Thom wrote this song after he was driving and he saw a bird fly across his windshield and he thought it was a U.F.O.\n\n""Exit Music (For a Film)"" was written for the film ""Romeo + Juliet"" in 1995. It is about them both killing themselves. If you listen to this song really loud, it is very haunting (especially on headphones). Once the song kicks in, Ed is practically tearing off his guitar strings to get the sound you\'re hearing. It all comes back with Thom singing, ""We hope that you choke."" A great way to end a song.\n\n""Let Down"" is one of my favorite Radiohead songs. The way he sings the lyrics is awesome. Most of the time you cannot decipher what he is saying. If you read the lyrics, he is talking about the decay of society. Once he starts singing ""You know, you know where you are with..."" and then he sings ""One Daaaaaaay...."" and the vocals switch from the right ear to left.......wow. If gives me chills every time.\n\n""Karma Police"" is a wonderfully piano driven song with great lyrics. ""Phew! for a minute there, I lost myself.""\n\n""Fitter Happier"" is said by most to be the worst song on this album. Even though it is not my favorite, it is still a good song. It is sort of the gist of the whole album. Another song with great lyrics.\n\n""Electioneering"" is probably my least favorite. Still a good song, but is overshadowed by the other greats on this album.\n\n""Climbing Up the Wall"" has a great drum beat and an overall creepy feel.\n\n""No Surprises"" starts off with a xylophone. The one thing I love about this song is the structure: verse, verse, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, and then finishes off with another line from out of nowhere, ""Such a pretty house an\' such a pretty garden....""\n\n""Lucky"" was written for all the people that died in the plane crash in Yoguslavia (I think). It begins with Ed strumming his guitar as close as he can to the frets. Very cool effect.\n\n""The Tourist"" is a great closer. It gives you the effect that the album is coming to a close (which Radiohead is very good at).\n\nHighlights: Airbag, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Let Down']",5.00 stars

LILTRUCKER,"['-----------This album is pure briliance, talent seeking out of its very pores. This album can be considered 5 star material, because of its effectiveness it brought upon towards the music industry and its listeners. There are people out there who do not like Radiohead for their dark lyrics and dark lifestyle, but I believe that these people don\'t quite understand how brilliant this work is and how it has changed rock music and lyrics and voice forever. This album has been a huge success, bringing a huge influence upon music today.\n-----------I think Radiohead gets their feelings and/or beliefs across more clearly in this album than they do in Pablo Honey and Bends. They begin a more well-known stereotype with this album in that it hit worldwide, shattering a huge barrier for Radiohead. The Bends in my beliefs should have started Radiohead\'s success, and I think it did, but not as much so for mostly everyone to realize until the release of OK Computer how great of on album Pablo Honey and The Bends are.\n-----------Each song on this album ""rains down"" upon you. Each song contains its own feeling. Some songs are rather spacy, dreamy, and dark, such as Sub. Homesick Alien. A great song for dreaming to. ""Uptight"" is a great lyrical representation of the feeling that is afflicted upon me through this song. A very emotive song in terms of its instrumental display from J. Greenwood.\n-----------With Subterranean Homesick Alien being my favorite song and following the classic Airbag and the long rock out of the instrumental classic Paranoid Android, this album has much more in store. After Sub. Homesick Alien, it leads into another very dreamy and rather dark epic, Exit Music (for a film). A very distraught and isolated lonely feel is cast upon most listeners, in that it is distorted in most areas and the synthesizers and the voice of Thom Yorke nearly put you to sleep with every listen.\n-----------Well, next comes Let Down, probably my second favorite, although quite hard to say, in terms of the whole album containing different feels and different genres, each song being extraordinary. This song is more emotive and upbeat in terms of instrumental. Lyrically wise this is probably one of my fav\'s on OK Computer.\n-----------The next three songs sort of sink as one for me, Karma Police, Electioneering, and Climbing Up the Walls. Each three being very different according to genres, but very similar through the lyrics and background. Karma Police is a spectacular piano orchestrated hit. Then with electioneering, it turns into a more upbeat phenomenal voice displayed by Thom Yorke, (the voice and rhythm of this song are great). Then with Climbing Up the Walls, you are lead into a much more dark chill. A song worth ""chilling"" to. Again, Thom\'s vocal ability never fails. Just plain great.\n-----------No Suprises, a song for me based on a very bittersweet lyrically frozen melody. This song is swiftly important dealing with lyrics, and is shown within the video, words backwards right to left.\n\nNO ALARMS AND NO SUPRISES\n\n-----------The last two, Lucky and the Tourist seem like a collage, turning into one song for me. Lucky, a song very far out with a backed up guitar off on off on off on off on, swivvles and ties itself in with Thom\'s vocal(reminds me of many Pink Floyd melodies.)No Suprises, written by Jonny, a great ending for the album. Ends with a sort of cashier ""ding"".\n-----------A great album, the foundation for fame in music that has been built since Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. A masterpiece and influential piece of brilliance.']",5.00 stars

HarryFleming,"['Brilliant. Building on the affecting songs on ""The Bends"", OK Computer takes music a step further with layers of synth and guitars which manage to take the listener through a variety of emotions while still retaining a definitive sound. Paranoid Android is a bleak, cynical commentary on modern life, Exit Music may be the most depressing song ever written, but it has intimate beauty and one of the greatest climaxes in any Radiohead song; Let Down is suprisingly uplifting, with a fantastic harmony in the third verse, and Climbing Up The Walls is genuinly scary, with a fantastic climax of wailing violins. A true masterpiece, and while I prefer the Bends, this may be Radiohead\'s definitive album.']",5.00 stars
Goregirl,"['Well since they waited 2 years between OK Computer and this album, I kind of forgot about the band. I didn\'t end up buying this until about a year later because I sort of thought they had their day and wondered what they possibly could have done that was so exciting. Then I started to see their videos for ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Karma Police"" and I was in love again, I even thought that they\'d improved which is remarkable because I loved OK Computer. This was far more creative and yet just as pretty and perfect for showcasing their strengths in particular Thom\'s voice. ""Airbag"", ""Climbing Up The Walls"", and ""Lucky"" fast became new favorites and I realized that Radiohead really had just taken their time to make the most amazing release possible and for that I\'m very grateful.

Chapter13,"[""I discovered Radiohead late in life. MTV debuted the Paranoid Android Video. Ok Computer had just been released and the music critics were calling it a masterpiece. But I didn't know this at the time. I just sat on the couch trying to relax after a long day and then it happened.\n\nA revelation.\n\nThe sounds washed over me. Sonic pathos carried on Thom Yorke's expressively sad voice. Something happened that hadn't happened in a long time while listening to music. I was actually moved, tugged in two directions- steeped in an emotionally sad narcotic and then shot full of adrenalin too, because this music was so goddamn exciting.\n\nI had been exposed to Radiohead before. They had received a ton of airplay with the angst ridden anthem Creep and less radio play with the touching Fake Plastic Trees and while I loved those songs, it was as if I had not really been listening.\n\nThis time, though, I was incredibly tuned in and as Paranoid Android assaulted my ears it was as if my music consciousness took an evolutionary leap forward. To turn a cliché on it's head, it was as if my mind imploded...... my mind turned inward, instead of being blown. The next day I ran out and purchased Ok Computer and with utter amazement I listened to an album of music that I felt and still feel is perfection personified. Not only was every song great but the order of the songs seem so right- almost operatic in it's ebb and flow, in it's descendo and crescendo, (ok, descendo is not a real word but it should be).\n\nSince that day I have gone back and discovered the other Cd's and of course, delved into the new stuff. I find some of it on par with Ok Computer and some of it not but it is all interesting, complex music.\n\n\nThe wonderful thing about Radiohead is that their worst music is still head and shoulders above the normal fare that you hear on the radio.""]",5.00 stars

gwargh,"['Yes, it is a great album, but not quuuuiiiite as great as most people say. _OK Computer_ builds on _The Bends_ in terms of technique and instrumentation, but the songwriting just doesn\'t match up. The level of texture they were able to accomplish with less glossy production on _The Bends_ will always impress me more than the smorgasbord of sounds they threw together on this album. Thom Yorke himself called this one a step down from the last. This is not to say I\'m biased toward _The Bends_\' more traditional rock instrumentation; both of these albums pale in comparison to _Kid A_, which is even more adventurous.\n\nTruly great music makes you care if you ever hear it again, and while I can understand if other people feel that way about this album, I seriously think I could live just as easily forgetting that ""Paranoid Android"" or ""Karma Police"" ever existed. Plus most of the rest of the songs haven\'t aged well, and even avoiding them for months at a time fails to renew the feeling they once gave.\n\nI see this as a transition album, when Radiohead were just on the verge of bringing out their most sincere expression but still bound by their influences. In three years, they\'d break free.']",4.00 stars

Every song is wonderful and fits in with the rest of the album. Songwriting this good cannot be ignored. And it\'s not just Thom Yorke alone, it is Johnny Greenwood and his amazing guitar in ""Paranoid Android,"" the landscapes of Ed O\'Brian in ""Subterrenean Homesick Alien"" and ""Climbing Up The Walls"". It has pop songs like ""Karma Police"" and songs that are just statements on its own like ""Fitter Happier"". This album also contains in my opinion (and thier\'s) Radiohead\'s best song ""Lucky"".

queensparkfc,"[""If you've not listened to this album, or any other Radiohead album, you may well wonder what the fuss is about. Ok Computer is the perfect answer to this. A magical album, right from the crunching guitar intro at the start of Airbag. People are in distress, planes crash, computers speak strange messages, and aliens come to earth. All this is made scarily possible over the course of these twelve tracks. The 7 minute masterpiece Paranoid Android is a mesh of different songs, expertly put together and delivered with perfection. The album goes on with style and you can tell the amount of time it took for Thom Yorke to get the tracklisting just right. Other standout tracks are Karma Police a fantastic quirky song, Let Down, the beautiful toy guitars and xylophone of No Surprises, the chilling backrdrop of domestic murder in Climbing Up the Walls, the powerful and soaring 'Lucky' and ..... well you get the picture.

monolith9001,"[""Alright, because Kid A is my favorite album (haven't heard Hail to the Theif yet) OK Computer doesn't do so well compared to it. It's almost up to Kid A standards by the uniqueness of every song but not in the sense that they're all rock songs and I don't like the wishy-washy mood to it. With Kid A there's a definate mood and ambience to the entire CD. Everythings anxious and dark and about to explode. Then in other parts, it's so delecate you could crush it between your index finger and thumb.\n\nHowever, with OK Computer, you do get Parinoid Android which is their hit, sure, but rightfully so. That's an epic song. There's so many ups, downs, and musical perfection in that song, it's hard to imagine the rest of the record matching it and sometimes surpassing it. BUT IT DOES! Many songs capture something that Parinoid Android never did - weakness. I've found Radiohead thrives on weakness. That's why I like most of their songs. They sound nutered, naked, and honest. Parinoid Android is like an 80's cock-rock ballad put next to those songs. But me saying that really does the song no justice. It's a damn good song and CD.

Lankyal,"['The album of the 90s, by some distance. Well, challenged by _The Bends_ of course, but that aside...\n\nTook a couple of listens to get into, and I wasn\'t actually all that interested until I saw the Paranoid Android video on MTV and loved it. I just remember the feeling of finding a band who could change and develop and remain utterly compelling to listen to, mainly because no matter how the sound changed there were some immovables - Thom\'s voice, Jonny\'s guitar and the rock-out factor which this song encapsulates perfectly. It\'s been glibly referred to as the Bohemian Rhapsody of the 90s, which is apt but over-simplistic, the only resemblance being the collage-effect of both songs, moving through a range of different styles within the same song. And the fact that both are pieces of total genius of course. As soon as I heard the ""rain down"" section I knew I wanted this album.\n\nIt takes a couple of listens to grasp the enormity of _OK Computer_, but once your brain finds the melodies and harmonies of each song and locks on it\'s compulsive - you must keep listening to see what they do next. Q magazine summed it up quite nicely by saying that the first five tracks make up the best opening 20 minutes of album music the reviewer had ever heard. Good point well put I thought. ""Airbag"" is like a statement of intent, then there\'s Paranoid Android, then Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music (incredible), and at track 5, the masterpiece, Let Down. The final verse with Thom\'s harmonies still frequently reduces me to tears. Then the singalong!! Karma Police has become Radiohead\'s anthemic show-closer, most notably at Glastonbury 2003 where 40,000 or so people chanted along in unison, and it is a fantastic, fantastic song. Especially the transcendant ""For a minute there I lost myself"" lines at the end.\n\nThe best thing about _OK Computer_ is that it\'s an album that makes sense as an album - the songs are ordered in a certain way so as to make sonic rationale as you listen, and after the glorious Karma Police you get Fitter Happier with its ""and now for something completely different..."" effect, followed by the punky (and relatively rather crap) Electioneering, and then the truly awe-inspiring sequence of Climbing Up the Walls, No Surprises and Lucky. By the time The Tourist kicks in you\'re spent. Climbing up the Walls\' middle ""rock-out"" section drives me wild, No Surprises is a hark back to the beauty of _The Bends_, and Lucky is earth-shatteringly excellent. Then The Tourist pleasantly (yet still ultra-intensely) brings the whole thing to a mind-bending conclusion, at which point you realise you\'ve heard the future of music.\n\n_OK Computer_ may not have had the explosive impact of Nirvana\'s _Nevermind_, but I will confidently assert that the two albums have been equally influential on the subsequent musical scene. A whole host of second-rate Radiohead emulaters, Coldplay and Muse being two of the better, simply wouldn\'t exist without this record, and apart from it\'s sheer innovation it\'s an amazing listen. Radiohead\'s harmonising is extraordinary, especially on Let Down and Paranoid Android, they do dark music like no other contemporary guitar band, and they rock their socks off too. What more can one possibly ask for?\n\nFor posterity\'s sake alone, please get this album. It\'s depth is apparently infinite, I\'ve been listening to it fairly constantly for coming on six years and I still adore it. Coldplay I can milk for a couple of months perhaps. That\'s the difference between a nice tune and great album. My number one desert island disc.']",5.00 stars

It's simply a well-written, well-crafted album that stands out as a masterpiece among the rest of the mainstream garbage released in the late 90s. But is it a masterpiece? Hell no! Is it groundbreaking? Not in the least. Radiohead overall is an extremely overrated band. They're a bunch of poseurs, really, all trying their hardest to appeal to the elitist indie kids who are duped into thinking they're listening to the most groundbreaking piece of music since Stockhausen came about (except they probably have no clue who Stockhausen is). This is just the vibe I get, so don't take offense to it. Radiohead can thank their success on the countless, more groundbreaking electronic and Krautrock bands that came long before them (Can, Eno, Neu!, etc.). Is Radiohead doing anything to truly revolutionize music? Well, Rolling Stone or Curt Loader may lead you to believe this - but that is what's called hype, and hype is what sells.\n\nRadiohead, to me are really just a bunch of whiny British guys who take themselves too seriously. They really annoy me after a while, I must say - especially mr. pretentious, Thom Yorke. Efrim, of the band Godspeed You! Black Emperor made a good point in an interview from a few years ago, around the time _Kid A_ was released. Efrim was asked what he thought about Radiohead and their new album. He responded by basically saying Radiohead are frauds. They preach anti-capitalism in their music, yet they are signed on to a multinational label and are obviously more than willing to mug for every rip-off, sellout magazine out there. I couldn't help but agree with Efrim somewhat.\n\n_OK Computer_ is one of the best MAINSTREAM albums of the 90s, and one of the most overated albums ever.""]",4.00 stars

Boerke,"['Just in one word: perfect. The album kicks off with ""Airbag"" and after hearing this song, you already know what great quality this album has.\nAll the songs on the album are highlights, but the most highlighted highlights are the before mentioned ""Airbag"", ""Paranoid Android"", ""Exit Music"", ""Karma Police"" and ""Climbing up the Walls"" (it\'s hard to choose the best song; no, it\'s not just hard, it\'s impossible!).\nThe album is hard to compare with other albums, because it\'s just one in a kind. But I can mention some influences, such as The Smiths (comes most forward in songs like ""Karma Police"") and Pink Floyd (just listen to the special effects in ""Climbing up the Walls"").\n_OK Computer_ is the best Radiohead album so far and I don\'t know if they will ever pass this pure work of genius, but that\'s a real challenge for Mr. Yorke and friends.']",5.00 stars
nickliddle,"['This is Radiohead\'s best album beyond a doubt. Especially on the back of a masterpiece like _The Bends_. Songs like ""Let Down"", ""Karma Police"" are unique rock tunes.']",5.00 stars
Babe_N_Co,"['Searching for Paranoids in Mirrors\nOnce every decade there happens a year of a breakthrough in music when there are released some very influential albums which define the future of music for the next ten years or so. In nineties it was 1997 when such revolutionary albums as Attack of the Grey Lantern by Mansun, In It for the Money by Supergrass, Vanishing Point by Primal Scream, Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space by Spiritualized, Radiator by Super Furry Animals and the cream of the crop, of course, is OK Computer by Radiohead. Radiohead with OK Computer practically gave birth to the genre which is now known by the name post-rock but in fact is a new breed of downbeat and often offbeat progressive rock with heavy use of computer electronics and almost paranoiac psychedelic atmosphere. Music is complex, shifting, rhythmically metamorphic and overloaded with melancholia emphasised by Tom Yorke\'s sorrowful vocals to the degree that Radiohead used to have almost as many haters as their followers. ""We hope that you choke, that you choke"", - so much for the reactionaries who continue to hate this epochal album.']",5.00 stars

Azazello,"['Time has put its ruthless finger on this album. I bought it on the day it came out and instantly liked ""Paranoid Android"", a track reminiscent of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", only turned inside out and moving with sheer abysmal force toward its own sonic apocalypse. Other obviously spectacular tracks are ""Climbing up the Walls"" with a guitar-drone so harrowing that even the claustrophobic buoyancy of the song title seems to capsize with negativity, and ""Lucky"", the attempt to cling on to hope so desperately that it crumbles between your hands. On the other hand, ""Electioneering"", apparently a left-over freak from _The Bends_, is a straightforward, out-of-place rock tune drowned in and neutered by too much studio polishing and ""The Tourist"" is just plain boring. I would love to hear Radiohead record someting really lo-fi because most of their songs would benefit from a sparser sound. Furthermore, the passionate urge of _OK Computer_ has been done simpler and far more convincing on Bonnie \'Prince\' Billy\'s masterpiece _I See a Darkness_.\nHowever, the album has undeniably been influential (and undeniably not only for the better!) and Radiohead has proven the aptness of their musical skills by constantly challenging themselves and their followers. Hopefully, we won\'t have to experience Coldplay attempt their own _Kid A_ and fail miserably.']",4.00 stars

petranka,"['""Paranoid Android"" is the best song Radiohead had ever written. And _Ok Computer_ is possibly their best album, in my opinion. Before they got too weird and experimental, at least for my musical tastes. But others might as well disagree.. I have really tried,and still I\'m trying to give them a chance, but - although I respect them a lot -probably Radiohead\'s music is not my cup of tea. As easy as that.']",4.00 stars

Kevo79,"['After first getting way into _Kid A_, I felt kind of disappointed by _OK Computer_. I admit, I came into Radiohead the wrong way, without really knowing their history of albums and their development as a band. But I found myself kind of bored listening to these songs after experiencing the aural experimentations of _Kid A_. I still love ""Karma Police,"" and the computerized muttering of ""Fitter Happier"" hints at things to come, but overall I like the avant-garde Radiohead of _Kid A_ and _Amnesiac_ much better. But that\'s just me.']",4.00 stars
crapulus,"[""Hey, if you're reading my review then you have either just read like 1000 other reviews above mine (mine might be on top, I can't really tell yet since I am still writing it) or you didn't.\nUmmm Radiohead yea um oh yea OK Computer WOW! This album is one of the few, if not the only, to be completely original. I mean no one has ever heard stuff like this before. I dont believe that is a naive statement either because I know there has been stuff that is weird and beautiful, but nothing has ever been so influential in the way that it has.\nSome of you dont care if its influential. I mean, hey, I dont like everything that was influential, but this really is a golden masterpiece. GOLDEN! and thematically mood setting. I will even say that if you dont have this CD then your collection is incomplete.""]",5.00 stars
Thom,"[""This Radiohead album never moved me.. it's too over complicated in nonsence layer's of Angst that it loses it's appeal quickly for me, as does the booklet artwork.

rickoneill,"[""Some people call this the greatest record of all time, but it isn't. There are moments of brilliance here, songs such as ''Paranoid Android'' and ''The Tourist'' show that, but there are also moments of self indulgence, as seen on ''Exit Music''.

Jrr_18,"['As great as the individual songs are, what makes this album so great is probably its overall darkness. A nice blend of sarcasm, sadness, and fear. The dark mood isn\'t set into overkill, such as in ""Goth"" music. The band\'s writing isn\'t implying anything that is outlandish. The album simply serves its purpose to cast a questionable shadow over a world that is at best is very questionable.']",4.50 stars
mariz,"['amazing, amazing, amazing.\n\nscrew the reviews, just an album where every song is enjoyable from beginning to end, because they DONT SOUND THE SAME. no two tracks are alike. teh whole album exudes mystery and paranoia. i think thom said it best when he described the album as sort of having a ""camera in the room"" recording everything that was happening...er something like that.\neach song tells a different story, from a different room, from one persons perspective, in a harrowing reerospect.\na brief overview\n1-airbag.--->fear of cars\n2.-paranoid--->fall of the roman empire? we\'ll never know for sure..\n3.-exit music---> a love story\n4.-let down---> loneliness\n5.-karma police---> when your concious catches up with you\n6. -electioneering---> a letter to the politicians.\n7.-fitter happier---> playing with computers\n8.-climbing up the walls- eeerie. just scary..(try zero 7 mix or frilla brazilla mix...quite good as well)\n9.-no surprises---> a lovely tune about disappointment\n10.-the tourist---> arret.\n\nevery track is sort of pieced together quite perfectly, in a sequence that is almost as satisfying as reading a fantastic novel in a day. stellar.\n\ni have no objections about this album. i heard it before the presses came and glorified it and i love it to this day. listen to the music, not the hype.']",5.00 stars
Acedia,"['Really challenging album. I admit that but giving this three or four chances I can feel the ice is breaking between me and this album. First I didn\'t get this at all, now I find myself listening some of these songs and actually liking them! ""Airbag"", ""Paranoid Android"", ""Karma Police"", ""Exit Music (For A Film)"" and ""No Surprises"" are in their own peculiar way very interesting and emotional songs. Especially ""Karma Police"" almost brings tears to my eyes, Thom sings with passion and he means every word he says.\nBut some of the songs like ""Electioneering"", ""Lucky"" and ""The Tourist"" offers no surprises (I don\'t mean the song) and they sound regular and sometimes even boring.\nAfter all I still like _The Bends_ Radiohead\'s best album, but this is worth listening if you have enough patient.
