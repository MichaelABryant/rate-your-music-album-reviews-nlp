i get why radiohead rub a lot of people the wrong way a lot of people just find them too cold and thom yorke has one of those voices that will drive a lot of people batty they are also such an enormously acclaimed band that a little backlash was just inevitable plus even i find their image as the selfordained darkest weirdest band on earth a little excessive and i gave this album five stars oh and did i mentioned how widely imitated they are we live in a world where bands like coldplay and muse and keane diluted this sound into something a little more radiofriendly and made buckets of money off it in cases like that you could not be blamed if you wonder does the original stand up after all well i have got some nitpicks of my own electioneering is not quite the headbangers extravaganza it clearly wants to be great guitars at the end though while fitter happier still sounds a little too edgy90s for my liking is not there a nine inch nails bside called a pig in a cage on antibiotics if i ever bust this score down to a 45 it is probably because they put these two right in a row my opinion on exit music for a film depends on my mood sometimes i get caught up in the gothic drama of the whole thing and other times it just seems like a whole lot of overheated nothing in other words i am not quite ready to go out and say ok computer is a perfect album i would have said that at one point a less mature point in my life indeed but you know how it is you get older and that album you loved so much shows a few of its rough edges yet the best songs on this album really are as good as you have heard pretty much all of them i would hesitate to call subterranean homesick alien a masterpiece but its subtly tricky arrangement and muchneeded humor make it an important addition to the album you have just got to lighten things up sometimes because this record gets heavy sometimes in terms of the guitars they tear some shit up in the loud parts of paranoid android but more in terms of the emotions this album is one negative trip my friends android lurches between queasy acoustic guitars wallrattling riffs and gothprog creepiness in brilliant fashion  think how happiness is a warm gun constantly keeps you off your kilter but the release is much different climbing up the walls plunges you deep into some horrormovie shit with huge drums processed vocals yorke let us some bloodcurdling screams loose and some of greenwoods earliest string arrangements even no surprises which musically is almost mccartneyesque in its mellow lull has some dark fucking lyrics radiohead plunges you into a dark and alienating world with this album is what i am saying here normally this kind of relentless grimness puts me off pretty sure i have raised this complaint about pink floyd but radiohead knows their way around a song the tunes i mentioned above are spectacularly wellcrafted androids multipart structure is no mere grab bag  each part not only flows with but builds onto the one before it climbing up the walls earns its explosive ending  the fireworks is always just waiting there so when they finally hit they feel like the most natural development no surprises is plenty lovely but with an ominous edge and hey there is more where that came from take my personal favorite let down this ones best known for its third verse where thom yorke duets with himself it is a soaring and spectacular moment the album at its most emotional and yearning and it gets there by way of a tense but lovely keyboard solo even before all that kicks in check out the blend of icy guitars and ringostyle drums that move the verses and choruses there is in short a real attention to sonic detail here the details why i never minded the beatles lift on karma police not only does the piano part fit in with the songs soft chorus beautifully but the textures in the coda are pure radiohead those five are the biggies for most people but the cool thing about this album is there is a lot going on here somehow i have made it alll this way without even mentioning the opener airbag shame on me what a great song the atmospheric guitar sprinkles of keyboards and cello hook might not surprise you but the song is also kind of funky great beat here and a great bassline too radioheads rhythm section does not get a lot of attention but they deserve a lot of credit for shaping their sound they do not get as much attention on the closer the waltzing tourist but that is also a feast of sound check out the dreamy country guitars the mellotron choir even the little ding of a triangle at the end while we are in the albums closing stretch i have always really enjoyed lucky yorkes soaring vocal and greenwoods most ballsout bombastic guitar make a great pair on this one i guess my only question is what to do about those two weaker tracks they had some great material in the vaults  the triphoppy instrumental meeting in the aisle would have made a much better transition than fitter happier and pearly rocks much better than electioneering i also wish polyethylene had found a home on an album  to my ears it is one of radioheads better tracks with a big tonal shift i have always really loved still we got the album we got not one of those albums where every song is a total gem but an album whose high points are so dazzling i cannot help but go the full five,5.00,5345
i would like to think i am good about not letting the wider critical world affect my own amateur reviews rather than saying this or that is overrated or underrated or making parallels about my opinions vs everyone elses i prefer looking at things within my own bubble  after all it is my opinion that matters the most to my listening habits and i imagine someone would read my thoughts to learn what i personally think with some records that is harder than others there is a number of albums that are so universal that they form a part of our collective consciousness even if we do not care about them albums which have been discussed and analysed so often and in such great detail due to their importance and place in the canon that there is literally nothing new to say most of the time i can still comfortably get by enough time has passed from the beatles pink floyd led zeppelin and other sacred cows that the old canon narratives are actively being argued against while new ones are established and there is a wider variety of opinions challenging the old classics and somewhere between those lines i am able to place my own opinion without feeling like i am better off just linking to the relevant wikipedia section not to mention that for most iconic records i am too much of a natural contrarian to hold them in the highest of pedestals in the first place ok computer is a curveball for me in this regard it is a landmark album and even i agree with that  to a degree that it feels like an actual challenge to start dissecting it apart you are not going to find unique angles to view this album through from me is what i am saying it is my generations sgt peppers and i am saying that without a single ounce of hyperbole it is a cultural milestone that has affected so much of the other music i enjoy inspired countless other musicians and shifted genre trends to this day it causes so much discussion analysis and overanalysis that we are all absolutely sick of it we can all recite from memory the story of thom yorke  co becoming increasingly fatigued by society and music industry at the same time as they felt their ambitions limited by their early sound and in turn exploding in fame and finding themselves even more fatigued through the record they made to channel all of that frustration and ambition through and if you do not you are pretending  because ok computer transcends any genre barrier knowledge if you are even remotely passionate about music it is omnipresentyou cannot avoid it no matter how much you want even now ok computer is a prime example of a band reaching for their lofty ambitions and realising the breadth of their own skill set and taking a boundarybreaking leap within their own path comparing pablo honey and the bends to it is practically pointless because the change is so vast there is enough hints on both albums particularly the bends to point out where ok computer came from but the narrative is loose the familiarities superficial at best ok computer effectively reintroduces radiohead from scratch the urban angst of grungeera guitar walls has evolved into premillennial apathy and depression and the band are musically thinking outside their own box to the point that the tropes introduced here are now aspects the band are forever associated with not just that but they are also elements that are echoed within the particular kind of rock music that followed in ok computers wake you can trace a direct genealogy from it to nearly everything that has been happening in indie and alternative rock since you think of angstladen introspective guitars and you will be able to trace them here like all the very best progenitors ok computer still sounds like its own thing even now despite how many times its tricks have been repeated there is nothing that combines them quite like here part of it is due to radioheads own uniqueness the very specific traits its members have yorkes falsetto wailing oft imitated never bettered and characteristic lyrical style most obviously but also jonny greenwoods flourishes inspired by modern classical and phil selways razorsharp drumming there is also the neurotic flair that ok computer is powered by that has never really been captured by its followers in quite this way yorke was very obviously not having a good time the band as a whole found inspiration through it and traces of it are all over the album whether it is the resigned exhaustion of no surprises the anger of electioneering or the downright crippling paranoia of climbing up the walls ok computer frequently sounds like its suffocating within its own four walls creeping closer together only to push them periodically away to reveal something hopeful for a fleeting moment ok computer is not radioheads best album i understand why paranoid android is iconic and as admirable as its multisuite progression is i have never seen it as a particular discography highlight and its first part towers above the others to the point i wish it was the blueprint for the entire song and electioneering meanwhile is basically an attempt to redo rems ignoreland but quite simply not as good they are good but neither are songs i could say lifts the album for me i also just think that radiohead started to get really interesting after they decided to deconstruct and reassemble themselves in ok computers aftermath which is when their skitterish neuroses found a sound that perfectly suited it but i understand why it is such a revered album and it would not need a great stretch to make me into a true believer too after all many of their best songs are here let down is in some days is in fact the best song they ever wrote period making the worldweary desire to disappear into the most gorgeous thing when in its final minutes the song jumps off a cliff and soars into the sunset on the wings of its layered vocal parts and intensifying instrumental section karma police is one of radioheads most haunting but bottles a quietly churning rage and it twists that dagger deeper with each new section it offers the finale for exit music for a film is like that bottled rage finally breaking through igniting into a wall of distressed sound of the like the bands rarely tried since the final stretch of the album is also probably one of the alltime best closing runs climbing up the walls makes an orchestral section sound distressingly claustrophobic it is phenomenal by the way the simple but endlessly beautiful no surprises is the other big contender for the bands best song and in fact its quiet but powerful fragility is what converted me into thinking there is something to this band after all lucky is as atmospheric a rock anthem as the band would ever do and the second verses introduction of the simple keyboard texture is one of my pet favourite moments of simple instrumental additions making a real difference and the tourist achingly floats in its own world giving the paranoia of the album a calm breathe out in the end ok computer has throughout its length hit with some big punches and overall high quality miserablist rock but it concludes like a real iconic moment in music history furthermore ok computer still feels just as relevant as it always was as well maybe even moreso in this modern society that is growing more cynical and fatigued by the month it is just as evocative and its songs are still impactful proving their strengths despite every single one of them having been picked to their bones over the years including the fitter happier interlude which genuinely has its own important slot in the overall flow and greater thematics of the album ok computer is a truly great album often stunningly so and very audibly a moment where a band realised their own capabilities towards greatness and made them a reality that so many people in the world agree with me a lot of them way more passionately than i do is a happy coincidence this is all to say that out of all the albums in my collection ok computer is probably the one record i find the most difficult to discuss but you are in luck in a matter of seconds you can find thousands of reviews articles and indepth essays that say what i would likely think anyway this must be what beatles fans feel like it is not one of my personal alltime greats but its place among the canon is more than justified,4.50,8325
there are radiohead devotees like there were once bowie devotees those who find the unexpected change in direction exciting rather than disconcerting those who discover a little more meaning in it all than the rest of us think necessary to enquire into it is an admirable tradition that goes back at least as far as the beatles ok computer draws a little from the beatles as from pink floyd and even u2 the 60s 70s and 80sman if you could put those big names into a successful mix then you are on to a winner ok computer does just that with a sound production that does justice to its prestigious forerunners quintessential artrock song based but sufficiently removed from any stifling grunge influence and liberated by a laissezfaire neoprogressive experimentalism it is no wonder that this is their most celebrated release  it reaches back to earlier generations rather than alienating them there is no denying that radioheads instincts for grand theatrics  combining biting selfanalysis and semibombastic instrumental innovation  are artistically convincing and yorkes vocal style probably summed up a generation of angstridden youngsters what is more the music can scale some frightening heights carefully crafted to be sure yet with a natural band feel but under closer scrutiny some of the patching up can be a little irritating where songs are not arranged to segue seamlessly they often resort to silly effects driven bridges and not every song stands up some are given artificial support that is not always successfully integrated  pulling out all the stops begins to sound like damage limitation on climbing up the walls it seems to work splendidly airbag too goes full tilt with breathtaking confidence but a song like lucky seems too slight to be dressed up that way likewise let down and electioneering fortunately subterranean homesick blues and paranoid android more than make up but if the album is only slightly overambitious that is not a crime and to be fair all the songs hang together and add up to one seminal rock albumperhaps one of the last in this age of downloading and playlisting but i do miss something to make me smile  rather than just nod  and it is odd perhaps that something so downbeat could have made such an impressionmuch like floyd in the 70s i suppose taking themselves so depressingly seriously and i miss a strong backbeat or a funky jazz for all its dazzle and guile as always it comes down to personal tastes this album means an awful lot to a great many people it is easy to see why,4.00,2528
i wrote a shining excellent review for this album and then the browser went nuts froze and somehow logged me out and the review was destroyed i am still pissed the fuck off just having to redo it all you know how much crap i write but in spite of this it is almost horribly fitting because that is what ok computer is kind of about and what is that well first what do you think might be the leading reason for a sort of revitalization in rock music with this year because it is undeniably the most alive year in the genre since basically 1991 easily not that anything was wrong with the 90s i hear tell electronic music from this time was strong and 9196 the golden age of hiphop right there some of the finest material ever dropped but for rock kind of a dry time not bad or anything justdry stagnate heck the last time rock was this dry was ages ago the mid70s and that was much briefer and 1975 kicked ass anyway so this is easily the biggest drought in the genres history so far sure part of the reason may have been how many awesome bands died or fell off prematurely right before it mbv janes addiction slint guns n roses stone roses pixies but mostly it felt strapped for direction and ideas only postrock truly excited and even that only really starts taking off with 97 anyway 97 solved the identity crisis because rock finally realized what was going on in the world around it and how to start putting that into music around 97 if you are old enough to recall was when the digital age really started to happened when information economy swung in for real a new technological and social world began lots of bands started processing that and the rewards were plenty and no one better synthesized it into a sound than radiohead did with ok computer except this is not the good sides of all that not the super sleek and clean aesthetics that graced much of the late 90s art world radiohead became obsessed with the dark sides the strange furious frustrations not with humans like the hippies and punks before them but with the claustrophobia and plastic of the inanimate around us this is in the lyrics and very much in the songs the music here is wonderful stuff a complete realization not only of everything they would been playing at since the start but of every single new thing they tried out too their old obsession with slow burning songs on bends did not all the way convince me in it is execution in fact one of the main things that made me weary of them from far off was all their slow songs the bends did not make me unscared either but here that side of them is made real doubtlessly great and worth it is time the more anthemic and energetic songs are astounding works here with all the simple britpop anthems running around at the time including virtually the whole of be here now it is easy to forget what a truly exciting and forward thinking rock anthem would sound like you know one that is not overly indebted to some past form of music and in comes songs like airbag karma police and climbing up the walls sounding like nothing else before themand sweeping you away in their sad grandeur the mood of the album is worth noting too it is at turns hopeful and despairing sometimes seemingly at the same time it is an odd sort of melancholy that seems almost disengaged in it is own fate the melodies are beautifully sad like the smiths before them but yorke sees no strut in his breed of misery like morrissey did instead it is almost resigned and passive about crumbling world very millennial in a way that music video of thom yorke calmly singing in a tube as water fills up around him is pretty damn apt i would say would not you and due to all this ok computer is perhaps still the one record modern rock lives in the shadow of not nevermind nevermind cast it is shadow deep into the 00s but mostly on irrelevant crap it is real legacy sadly being teenage angst has paid off well rather than any meaningful cultural imprint aside from killing off much of the old mainstream anyway instead it is ok computer that has informed subsequent rock mostly the brits with bands like muse and coldplay but also north americans like interpol and arcade fire this is 2000s music being born here far more important than people give it credit for and people give it a ton of credit as is rating 5 highlights airbag paranoid android karma police climbing up the walls,5.00,4379
hurrah finally i had my first radiohead experience after all these years ok computer on a burned cd hurrah i had to wait so long in earnest how can anybody really enjoy a record like this these ever meandering songs that sometimes start auspicious or have some decent middle part before or after mostly presenting some nervewrecking noise this whining singer whose voice is even more bugging than bonos where do these lads have their ideas from is it u2s misled achtung baby is it some unknown troubled psychedelic trip jazz prog combo from finland or so i do not know and to be honest it does not interest me at all maybe in the end radiohead are some paranoid androids ha ha ha ps there is one track that somehow appeals to me throughout its very length it is called lucky and another one almost manages the same achievement it is called exit music for a film nevertheless even these songs probably would not make it on one of my mix cds for the car stereo,2.50,958
radiohead and nigel godrich have created a truly decadent atmosphere by creating a kaleidoscopic psychedelic prog rock masterpiece where the eminent neurotic thom yorke expresses his anxiety very emotionally for the coming millennium,5.00,233
yes i am white yes i am middle class yes i am a student yes i have had my problems with women yes i play guitar no i have not cut my hair in about 6 months yes i wear band tshirts and baggy trousers all the time yes i dabble in recreational drugs yes i enjoy my pretensions of liking all genres of music and yes ok computer is without a shadow of a doubt my favourite album of all time i love every note of this album and every time i hear it it feels like a revelation hooray for being a total stereotype at least i did not vote lib dem i guess 2014 edit almost none of this is true anymore but i am still a total stereotype so leave it yeah,5.00,642
so let me get this straight a bunch of onehitwonder grunge copyists pablo honey bottom out after flitting over to overlyprecious britpop the bends and then decide that song structure is what is holding them back the melodies and words on ok computer sound like thom yorke is making them up as he sings them the thematic conceit is retarded the music  while not wholly unlikeable  trades bombast for pretension and some people find this challenging and outthere it is avantgarde for people who have never heard anything avantgarde  much closer to the meandering tuneless selfimportant prog bullshit that made punk rock necessary unfortunately  though predictably  this psuedointellectual gussiedup britpop approach to experimentalism proved safe enough that ok computer tapped into the zeitgeist in other words it is just out there enough to give a conservative mainstream audience a fleeting sense of being hip now get back in your cages,2.50,937
i can sort of understand the praise this album gets the execution is really pretty good and if you are buying what they are selling i can see the attraction i am not however buying i had not intended ever owning this as every radiohead song i would heard has left me cold but after a lengthy discussion with a friend who could not understand how anyone could not like this he gave me a copy assuring me that i would come around i tried i really did but i just cannot enjoy this at all the biggest sticking point is probably the annoyingly whiny i am just so fucking profound vocals but not far behind is all the clich studio gimmickry the weak songwriting and uninteresting arrangements the band does play well from a technical standpoint but that stopped being enough for me when i was about 14,2.00,795
i can see a few progressive rock elements in this record at least it surely has a very elaborated psychedelic  alternative rock style the grunge electric guitars may remind you the king crimson of the mid 70s the psychedelic dimension may remind you pink floyd and porcupine tree there are 2 elements that i really do not like 1 the electric guitars arrangements that have a gross garage sound 2 yorkes plaintive and irritating voice that expresses all the pain  misery one can feel during his early life the melody and harmony are not too much present on most of the tracks thom yorke sings a bit like bono of u2 is the way he sings a manifestation of all the pain he has lived the tracks are serious and depressing maybe this record allows the deletion of internal uneases this record does not have this effect on me the main problem is the lack of catchiness and addiction plus one has to admit that the tracks sound pretty marginal the worst moments are definitely tracks like fitter happier and electioneering electioneering is a real teeth grinding track there are some decent moments subterranean homesick alien has not bad keyboards arrangements  echoed ambience the good futuristic end of let down is unfortunately too short the more melodic track no surprise actually has a surprise some good percussions which may make you forget the annoying rhythmic guitar the tourist and let down have catchier refrains if i compare to the usual alternative rock bands then ok computer is more interesting and sophisticated on the other hand i do not feel the need to keep this record in my collection 2 stars seems appropriate please live and let live do not tell people what to like or to not like there is a reason that explains why people like radiohead and the important is that it is good for them,2.00,1801
so yeah i decided highest rated on the site got to be worth a listen and i will admit i kind of wanted to come out all selfrighteous and dismissive of this socalled masterpiece but you know what credit where it is due this is not half bad probably more so if you are a particular fan of accessible art rock it gets particular points for exit music as a genuinely absorbing and emotional dirge however also being honest much of the rest feels fairly disposable is it the best album ever no not by a long shot but it is not worth hating either,3.00,541
i do not get why this is number 1 the best thing i can say about it is that it is at least not annoying why do so many people like music like this it has no energy no heart it sounds like the kind of music you would use in a movie because nobody notices it paranoid android is the best song but i should rather say it is the only one i can bear i do not hate radiohead i just do not see what i should like about their music for me this album is a bunch of very tedious songs that do not deliver anything memorable except some horrible moanig vocals,1.50,548
there are certain classics that will no matter what be known as an epitome of classical standard for all the future of that particular art for example all movie fans will forever idolize the godfather all literatureobsessed bodies will continue to glorify shakespeare all fans of cartoons will find solace in the flintstones and scoobydoo there is something wonderful about music though and it is that there is not just one kind of music i know there also is not just one kind of movie buta movie is a movie it is the same experience no matter what it may be about you sit down you watch something it means something the end music is not quite like that sure we sit down we listen to something it means something the end butmusic also manages to utilize tens upon hundreds of elements in one song where it then throws them into a giant melting pot for mixing and then finally dump the contents onto the person who is experiencing the music aka the listener it is only fair to conclude that each and every song is felt and experienced differently by each and every individual to be fair to the movies and books and cartoons of the world all of which i hold dear to my heart as well i know that each of the aforementioned things applies to all forms of art it seems though that with music we are given a much more vague and selfreliant hold on exactly how to enjoy it when you sit down and watch a tv show all you need is a little bit of attention your eyes to the screen and a comfy place to sit if you have all of these the only thing that can keep you from enjoying said program is an intellectual difference with music it requires much more work on the listeners part you need to focus on the sounds listen to the words form the atmosphere that the song will carry and remain in an alert and sound environment at least when you are still getting used to a particular piece of music this is one of the reasons that i turn to music to quench my artistic thirsts radiohead in particular does not help the average listener quite the contrary actually when i first heard ok computer i was compelled to turn it off because i was so out of my element upon hearing it for the first time that was years ago now and i am glad that i continued to give this band and more importantly this album chances what starts out as a very attentionneeding listening session ok computer manages to lay all of its cards out on the table in a very easy fashion once you have gotten to know it it is almost like the really interesting cool kid who does not trust anybody almost everybody knows who they are and many people who have become friends with that person find them to be incredible butat the same time it is a really difficult task to get yourself that high in this persons graces ok computer flat out rejected me and my tastes the first time i heard it and i was so discouraged that i did not go back for well over a year i just took it that radiohead was not for me i later could not handle all of the hype for this band and decided that i would jam this thing into my head no matter what some say that forcing something on yourself is a bad thing but i learned that statement to be a false one as i will say with many of the albums featured in my favorites list i like to listen to my albums as a whole this does happen to be one of those records where i do not like to single out songs butthat is the wonderful thing about this album i can i can actually listen to this as a whole but then go on to pick out and listen to individual songs that are of particularly noteworthy quality some say that this would throw off the album consistency but i do not find that true for ok computer radiohead paints a wonderful picture on almost every track that this album has to offer i say almost due to two filler tracks airbag which everyone loves and i find to be a whiny mess and fitter happier a crappy and creepy interlude of sorts analyzing just a few of these key songs i would like to point your attentions to what many myself included consider radioheads very own stairway to heaven paranoid android this was the first radiohead song i ever heard and i did not care for it the first time i heard it i decided i would let it grow on me though and i am satisfied with this song yeah it is a great song even if there are a few better songs from this album anyway subterranean homesick alien earned its high graces from me when i decided to play it on repeat one night for 65 times i slept through most of those sixtyfive listens but the theme is forever embedded into my conscious and subconscious mind let down earns itself as the most beautiful song of the album and karma police gets the award for the catchiest still one song will always reign over the others for me and that song is climbing up the walls this is a contender for my favorite radiohead song ever packing in some of the strongest emotional themes that has ever been touched in alternative rock fear insanity and the unknown while these are not the only songs noteworthy of mentioning from ok computer i feel that i would only be bringing down the review and wasting your times mentioning more such as electioneerings museesque qualities or exit music for a films wonderful sentiments okay i slipped up a bit there radiohead would not go on to do another rockbased album in a long time after this one even this album was not all rockbased the bends serves as the final truly rock album by radiohead and i really wish they had balanced their future works out as well as they did here maybe that is why this is considered by many to be radioheads blackwater park who knows all i know is that each song manages to speak for itself this is a quality that i find many bands struggle with mr yorke demonstrates the proper way to do such things just how this album managed to evolve my tastes is something that i can barely begin to describe if i started i would probably break some sort of hidden character limit that rym has for reviews with all that i have said i would like to close my thoughts gently with a lovely line from frenchies review as you can see it is nearly impossible to actually describe and review the music contained on this record it is just everything the meaning of life may well be hidden in there somewhere this album is simply one of the greatest and easiest listening experiences for any person who has the patience and will to achieve such zen i encourage everybody to not give up when they hear thisit is far too amazing to give up on there are certain classics that will no matter what be known as an epitome of classical standard for all the future of that particular art and ok computer has went down as that very standard that all experimental and alternative rock follows have a lovely day everybody,4.50,6779
for whatever reason earlier on i was sat about reading this albums wikipedia page and i thought you know i really need to listen to this this is essential music there are radiohead albums out there you have never heard and instead you are listening to aryan kampf 88 wikipedia sure makes a big fuss about some guys who made a record makes the songwriting process sound like some sort of worldchanging historical event the amount of praise vomited upon this album had me prepared to believe the hype as i put my headphones on i looked around the room and was halfthinking that when this thing was over my life would not be the same again after my head was cleared of bombastic thoughts i pushed play and submitted to 53 minutes of radiohead and lo it sounded alright this is nowhere near as epic as i thought it would be i mean airbag is a pretty damn epic way to open an album but the majority of the remaining tracks just seem a little too pedestrian for my liking when i was expecting something experimental here is the part where i get contrarian most of this is just poprock do you hear me i said most of this is poprock and i am not trying to be an arsehole let down kind of reminded me of that song by take that about riding on a star and ruling the world just a little bit more fancy with some electrobleeps here and there i just think that above all thom yorkes mumbling style is not really too my liking i do not find he has enough presence songs like exit music passed by unnoticed electioneering was a muchneeded harder track but is let down by a completely anticlimactic chorus i will not deny that the whole thing has a good atmosphere particularly subterranean homesick alien and paranoid android especially the god loves his children part no surprises is probably the highlight in terms of guitar playing call me a bullshitter but while most people say that fitter happier is the albums weakest moment i thought it was one of the strongest tracks it is just so eerie this cold mechanical texttospeech voice recycling cliches of the advertising industry over sparse electronica it seems a more interesting indictment of consumer culture than what we get in the other songs if thom yorke devised this piece when he had writers block maybe writers block gives him better ideas do you want to hear a great album listen to tenacious ds complete discography instead belch,2.50,2380
let us say you could buy this album for around 12 you want to know if it is worth it right here is what i would pay for each track considering singles go for about 12 on itunes or other retailers airbag at least 20 paranoid android 35 sub alien probably 20 exit music 30 let down 35 karma police 15 fitter happier 10 electioneering 15 climbing up the walls 25 no surprises 20 lucky 25 the tourist 25 total over 280 this may seem ridiculous but this album is seriously worth 2030 others it will last you a lifetime i have owned it for 15 years now and i still hear something newexciting every few listens it is an album you will never grow tired of ok computer is so good that i often see it in record stores and get tempted to buy it again again just to have that amazing sense of discovery that feeling and knowledge that i would stumbled upon something as perfect as this and you have,5.00,886
in october 1997 i bought my copy of ok computer it had not been one of those albums that i really wanted at that age like the mellon collie was to name one that i am not so embarrassed about but it did earn a special place in my collection in addition it was one of those cds that was a british edition and that they sold in disco stores before the national distributor in this case emi colombia launched its own edition therefore the book that it brought was as it should be in fact  i protected the edge with clear tape not one of those thinner paper accordions track 7 was hopelessly scratched for the aiwa recorder that i had bought a year ago and it was obvious at the time that fitter happier was not interesting at all so i skipped it every day in a row tuned to ok computer many times when i was just getting to know radiohead i said that the good thing here was almost everything but what was worth it was paranoid android and a little karma police or even exit music for a film i bought the cd because many magazines mentioned it as one of the great events of the year and they rotated the video of those two animated characters with some adventures in places that today do not seem so crazy to me in fact i had never seen thom yorke before so when i heard these songs i imagined him very differently the images that this record produced for me were of a not so distant future bright but monotonous unlike today when listening to it i perceive that present of 1997 shedding the last traces of romanticism that humanity had left all this because what new thing can be said about ok computer that does not come out too much it is an excellent album that is still valid today and one of the few that after the seventies showed that musically there were still things to do among those trips through time that art allows you to do now i can say that without a doubt this album can be placed next to the recognized masterpieces of the fathers of rock maybe i can add some new buts  electioneering reminds you of the most powerful songs of the bends but it does not even cast a shadow on them  airbag is a good song and surely one of the happiest in a melancholic discography but seeing the rest of the repertoire a better song could open the album of course it fulfills the task of introducing you from the beginning to the irony of that absurd desolate world in which sharp riffs bounce and everything falls apart between bits and tears  the tourist has a beautiful almost aquatic melody which reaches the level of ecstasy needed to end such an album but yes depending on the mood you are in it can be magical or boring  let us pretend that paranoid android is not so much a single great idea for a song and more several simple ideas very well executed to refer to a broad concept if something could not have it is a certain charm that it provoked general empathy hence many like it so badly because it does not reach them that yes the instrumental is brutal and the concept in those days worked while today not so much because we lost part of the apocalyptic fear of the nineties  climbing up the walls sounds a lot like all the other bands that were resonating back in those days yes oasis  i just read a comparison between radiohead and muse while listening to the album the simple fact of bringing up that many learned here how rock should sound and they performed it cheaply is a confirmation of how great this band is but it is also a reference to musical acts that should be forgotten i know that little of what i just said is not so true and that i have had to search to want to suggest an improvement and surely i can contribute by adding what i have reassessed today listening to ok computer i am analyzing it song by song and not trying it conceptually in other words the idea is already more than assimilated there is nothing to discuss what remains is to rediscover within those new moments that music is generating at this moment today ok computer just like a few albums is a work that must be assimilated in this way in order to find if anything a defect or something new that has not been said with all this today i know that of all the music i heard in 1997 ok computer is the only one that persists in my memory not only as a reference in terms of sound but also in terms of quality,5.00,4305
this album changed rock and roll it put the unmistakable classic sound of 60s80s sock in a blender and mixed in the technological flavors and paranoia of the coming century in this way it can be seen as the bridge between classic and modern rock a bridge that exists at a heightened level between each of its sides more so than any other album every song is a work of genius and can be listened to for endless hours from airbag to the tourist the album flows seamlessly instilling an atmosphere of passionate complexity as well as moments of intimate melancholy this is not a sunny album  if anything it is stormy it forces you to listen and you do not really even realize why your eyes are wet until the last ding of the tourist any music lover who does not own this album is a fraud,5.00,784
it feels like everyone who loves ok computer has a story to tell some stories are more romanticised than others but everyone who loves this album either seems to recall the first time they listened to it the moment they fell in love with it or the reasons why it has had such a profound and lasting effect on them and i am not too much different to start with the album basically changed my entire perception of what music was capable of it made me truly understand what music was capable of in pretty much all aspects but it was the first time i took into account track listings and sequencing and how an album with overall cohesion themes a vision and having something to say could really be something special of course along with the best album ever tag hyperbolic praise gets bestowed upon it this album and the bands music in general means a lot to people and people make their feelings known as well as hyperbolic praise a backlash of hate from people who deem it to be overrated even though it is generally considered to be a masterpiece like with most things people will hold an opinion to the contrary but this is the kind of album that means so much to me on a personal level that i really do not care about any of the acclaim adoration backlash hate or whatever else that comes along with it even though with an album as adored as this the people that do not see anything in it are in the minority i just do not care about their opinion i just let them have it i obviously do not understand opinions that differ from mine because i hear something different i think the main factor in this being one of the best albums ever is because it is incredibly personal it is thematically strong these are not just mere vapid or vacuous songs about nothing they have an incredibly strong thematic centre and the subject matters of each song resonates with me it is an existentialist album and one that feels incredibly personal ok computer is about alienation isolation disassociation loneliness paranoia and a whole host of other things but to start with when i listened to it aged 15 i just loved the album at first unlike many other peoples stories the album did not have a profound impact on my life at least not straight away before i would heard this i originally listened to and owned the bends and pablo honey and i loved them both  this was back when all i listened to was rock and guitar based music and nothing else i am not sure why i decided to listen to those two albums before ok computer because i knew ok computer was the most famous radiohead album and the album often cited as the bands crowning achievement but i somehow did anyway so after listening to the bands first two albums for a while i decided to listen to ok computer the first thing that really struck me about the album was just how much better it was than anything guitar based i would ever heard before before it meant something and really resonated with me on an emotional level it just sounded so ridiculously good it immediately made me dislike pablo honey it just blew it out of the water in every single way when i listened to ok computer i also was listening to a lot of oasis it blew them out the water it basically blew everything guitarbased from the 90s away i remember not knowing what the album was about or why it was so great i just knew it was something pretty damn special it did not completely change my music taste when i listened to it 15 years of age i still listened to an awful lot of crap before it and after it but this definitely shaped my music taste in the future when i first listened to ok computer the lyrical content was too cryptic for me to even begin to understand then we skip forward a few years every time i listen to this album now all i hear is alienation social anxiety and a real personal struggle brought on by technological advances and how they change the way people interact with others and the isolation it brings so the album starts and airbag comes on with airbag you have a strangely refreshing song  at least on the surface a song about escaping death a new lease of life being born again and being saved though it may be steeped in sarcasm you can never quite tell but every time i listen to it i always wonder if there has ever been an opener quite like it and it always makes me feel incredibly uplifted then immediately after you have paranoid android which has got to be a contender as one of the greatest songs ever written though not actually my favourite on the album you have a song that i believe heavily deals with technology bringing out social anxiety in people  the yuppies networking the panic the vomit but i also get the feeling it is a song about revenge and living with the guilt of your actions  i am paranoid but not an android a song about fearing for your safety while all the time remaining true to yourself and taking comfort in that the third song on the album is subterranean homesick alien is a song which i just think is about alienation and wanting to escape i think there is vague nods and science fiction influences on the album and as a fan of things like blade runner that is only a good thing i was never quite sure about this songs meaning whether the alien was yourself and it is a metaphor for how disassociated you are whether it is a literal extraterrestrial encounter whether it is what aliens would think about human beings human nature and human behaviour if they could look down and see us from a distance but i finally decided it was a song that is just escapism i wish that they would swoop down in a country lane late at night when i am driving take me on board their beautiful ship show me the world as i would love to see it being so disassociated you just want something radically different next you have exit music for a film every time i listen to it all i can think about is romeo and juliet but again it is just wanting to escape the fifth song is the best song on the album and is a contender for the best song ever written recorded and performed let down is about as perfect as music can possibly get beautiful haunting affecting powerful thematically dense lyrically insightful it is my favourite song on the album which says an awful lot i have always thought that it was both about modern transport and how uneasy it makes you but i think it is mainly about frank kafkas metamorphosis in fact it is more of a continuation of that in kafkas novel you have the protagonist who is a man turned insect and everyone is repulsed by him feeling great despair and pain he gives up and dies alone when let down starts it really is one of the most uplifting songs on the album musically the sweet melody comes in the uplifting guitar starts but it is juxtaposed with the most emotionally devastating and despondent lyrics it is such a melancholic bittersweet and beautiful song i think unlike in metamorphosis he is not looking for pity do not get sentimental it always ends up drivel and despite great misery and despair there is a glimmer of hope that one day it will all be okay with let down you have one of the best songs ever but what follows is almost just as good karma police is a song that is incredibly bitter scathing and angry it is obviously about karma people who have done wrong they will get what is coming to them i think this is one of the most weirdly catchy songs on the album as well every time the for a minute there i lost myself bit comes in my heart skips a beat then after the best run of songs in music you have the song that grinds everything to an abrupt halt it is most definitely the most controversial part of the entire album and even people who love all of the 11 other songs have hated this one fitter happier is a song i have grown to really appreciate but it is kind of difficult to like it it is just short of two minutes it is a song that people think is where thom yorke went full pretense on the album but i have grown to really appreciate it it is a song that has a robotic voice talking over a very simple ominous and haunting piano melody that seems to get more and more desperate and full of despair as it goes on the robotic voice is talking about all the things you are supposed to do as a healthy well functioning human being it is about how all those values can be an oppressive thing and if you are not doing all of the things you are meant to you will be medicated into being a lifeless zombie on antidepressants not a song as such but one of the most haunting moments on the album and i love it for that after the slow ominous haunting quality of fitter happier the band launch into one of the loudest and powerful songs on the album in electioneering again it is another form of juxtaposition on the album that works so well it sounds like the bendsera radiohead much more than any other song on the album it is a song that is about politicians and their devious nature and how they are morally bankrupt and will do anything to succeed and get your vote as well as a critique of voodoo economics which is about right wing corporate greed and cutting taxes for the rich it is one of my least favourite songs on the album but it is still great next up you have climbing up the walls one of the most insidious and sinister songs on the album that is musically and lyrically incredibly dark and bleak i think it is a song about mental disorders but i am not too sure every time i listen to the album and it comes on i always feel incredibly uneasy after climbing up the walls you have one of my most personally affecting songs on the album no surprises which i have always considered to be one of the most existential and despairing songs on the album that is about how that conformist life spoken about in fitter happier slowly destroys you and how disaffected you feel because of it so disaffected in fact that suicide and death would be a release a handshake of carbon monoxide i think the best line in the song and one of the best lyrics on the album is one i can relate to  a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you with the album coming to an end you would be forgiven for thinking that after such amazing songs it would taper off but the last two songs are incredible lucky is a song that i think is thematically linked to airbag a song about escaping death i think it is one of the most upbeat songs on the album in its lyrics where it is the only sign of any glimmer of hope lastly the tourist the closer of the album one of my least favourite songs on the album but they decided to close it on a quieter more reflective note it is about being a tourist and observing how other tourists are rushed and harried and it is just another critique of society while we are in a busy money orientated consumerist society we should slow down and think about where we will really going and the reasons why in conclusion ok computer is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and it contains so many songs that i think are as good as music can get as i said earlier when i first listened to the album at the age of 15 it just sounded good to me but did not really mean anything but in the 6 years i have been listening to it since it has of course become incredibly important to me and has had a profound impact on my life i can recall the exact moment when this album had a profound impact on me i was around 19 years of age and i was listening to it in the car driving somewhere i was only half listening to it but i was leaning up against the car window and i was sort of phased out i was there in body but definitely not in mind suddenly an overwhelming feeling came over me i felt nauseous strangely claustrophobic and incredibly vulnerable but it was all okay because ok computer was there and radiohead felt exactly the same way transport motorways and tramlines some moments on ok computer are spine tingling other moments are disturbing and some moments are simply beautiful this is truly one of my favourite albums of all time,5.00,11995
ok computer left a huge legacy i think  for a generation of listeners it resonated in a way that had a major impact on their musical tastes this is true for me i would never heard anything like it when i first listened long ago getting to know it inspired a lot of my musical curiosity that lives with me to today it is got a solid balance of being grounded in rock traditions and therefore approachable while also using songwriting and song structures that can be surprising and creative and just really beautiful many of the vocal melodies are gorgeous and help hold the whole thing together and the production sounds really rich and gorgeous up until today for me this is a favorite that has stood the test of time,5.00,717
the knowledge that you love radiohead is like a foundation of reality a supporting wall of your little house in the uncaring wilderness of the void that some people can listen to ok computer and not be awestruck dumbstruck thunderstruck and possibly several other hithertounnamed kinds of struck or even worse actively dislike it is a reminder that sometimes other people seem to inhabit an entirely separate and unfathomable plain of existence thom yorkes voice is perfect  it is the kind of voice that makes me amazed to be human and incredibly grateful that a person was born who could sing these specific words in such a way the songwriting on every track is beyond belief melodic to the extremest extreme when you realise that let down which tucked into the middle part of the album could be likened to stonehenge being surrounded by the great pyramids and the parthenon and yet is still miles ahead of pretty much anything any other band was doing at the time and has done since you begin to comprehend the greatness of this album,5.00,1036
you have heard it all before so i will just point out what is important for me  in no particular order 1 the tourist  the albums worst song  is also the most fitting closer for the album in the way that the repeated hey man slow down  idiot slow down links the album cyclically with its opener airbags in a fast german car i am amazed that i survived  an airbag saved my life apparently the band spent an entire day deciding on the finalized tracklist and it really shows not just in the opener and closer but the whole thing really works as a cohesive unit in a way that the bends definitely does not 2 ten years from now the band would extract one of the best parts of the tourist  the melody at the 023 mark  and recycle it for nude the you go to hell line and expand on it this is neither here nor there i just thought i would point that out 3 lucky is one of the two songs off ok computer that could be criticized for its genericness without ed obriens injection of atmosphere we would essentially be listening to some of the easiesttolearn guitar chords that being said there is one key moment that actively excites me when thom yorke takes a pause after it is going to be and belts out a glorious day people often stereotype radioheads songs as cynical music made for cynics  that one moment is a rebuttal  an affirmation of life and a testament that it is worth living 4 the movement to catharsis within exit music for a film is another such example 5 electioneering  great title  is the other of the two songs off ok computer that could be criticized for its genericness but people who think it should have been cut off the album forget that this is a muchneeded burst of energy on an album that mostly deals with the melodramatic 6 fitter happier everyone is favorite spanking child on the album manages to take the beatles revolution 9 and condense it into 2minutes worth it is terrifying both in the background piano that is playing from within a locked room in your house and the concept that human behaviors have become the equivalent to how we input commands into a computer turning us into a pig in a cage on antibiotics even if you hated the song did it really waste all that much of your time being 2 minutes and all did it really did not think so 7 actually my least favorite track on the album is subterranean homesick alien not because it is bad but because it is a summery song on a wintery album but there is one key moment  the quiet surroundings when thom yorke sings but i would be alright at the 255 mark and onwards and how things go completely chaotic at the 317 mark i am just uptight 8 when i first heard the smashing pumpkins today it was a revelation to me  putting sad lyrics to a song in a major key though upon further exploration in music this juxtaposition is not all that rare but still let down is a huge improvement on that in a comparison between the two tracks thom yorke is more abstract in what he is saying  what exactly does the repeated you will know where you are with actually mean is anyones best guess  but that is a mantra if i have ever heard one there is not anything as obvious as corgans wristslashing pink ribbon scars line though every line in radioheads best ballad yes it makes both fake plastic trees and street spirit fade out look like the stuff of soap operas in comparison is heavyhitting it is an effect that is produced by the way thom yorke moves from vague topics transport  motorways and tramlines to more direct ones the emptiest of feelings and clinging onto bottles or the second verses wings twitch  legs are going to do not get sentimental  it always ends up drivel furthermore his falsetto in the songs last stretch is the most best use of falsetto i have ever heard 9 people who accuse radiohead has being unimaginative by offering the fact that they lifted the chord progression from sexy sadie for the bridge need to learn that there are better things to drink than haterade yes that is been welldocumented but it is also a the leastinteresting part of that song the rare case of a song whose verses are catchier to say the least than the choruses if i were to break it down into parts and b constitutes such a small section of the song that i am left thinking who cares the thing about radiohead is that they have managed to assimilate their influences into a package that is accessible for people who might not have enjoyed those influences otherwise in an extreme example you have got people wearing beatles shirts and listening to aphex twin songs anyway i do not have much to say about karma police except that if you are a novel guitarist you might want to start there it contains practically every chord you will ever need do not try to start with paranoid android like i did  you will hate yourself and your roommates will hate you too 10 also that ending of karma police manages to wonderfully capture that paranoid feeling you get when on certain jaunts with mary jane the same goes for how inhuman yorke sounds on climbing up the walls 11 people bring up normal multipartite standards when praising paranoid android the beatles happiness is a warm gun or stupidly queens bohemian rhapsody but their similarities end with the use of the adjective both of those tracks were uplifting paranoid android is cathartic there are plenty of things to note within it the riff in the second part of the song starting at the 157 mark that secures its place as one of the most badass riffs ever thom yorkes whines at the 212 mark that manage to actually convey the paranoia that he sang about in the first part of the song how thom yorkes most visceral performance in his you do not remember you do not remember why do not you remember my name off with his head man off with his head man why will not he remember my name i guess he does oooooooooooooooyeahhhhhhh leads right into jonny greenwoods equally visceral solo at the 304 mark the amount of counterpoint especially in the slowtempo part within the song that could make johann sebastian bach shit his pants the way there is a really subtle chord change in the lone acoustic strum under thom yorkes final lines god loves his children that signals the whole band to come crashing back in with the assaulting riff with thom yorkes yeah music 12 it is unfortunate that it is been overlooked thanks to everyone rushing to hear the main attractions paranoid android let down karma police no surprises but airbag is fantastic and much more than just an opener for paranoid android those beeps were a fantastic idea speaking of the albums cohesiveness again parlophone clearly understood how essential those beeps were to paranoid android that they kept them for the 2008 compilation radiohead the best of unfortunately since they were proceeded by just there was something lost in the translation  airbag and paranoid android go together like pasta and pasta sauce no airbag is a wonderful testament to brian enos work listen to how some of phil selways drums are replaced by lasers  the same effect was done on talking heads thank you for sending me an angel and how much music has changed since the whole thing sounds like it was fed into a computer one of the few times this is meant as a compliment from how incredibly dense the song is the the cellos phrasing is deliberate cut but that barely registers because of how it interchanges with the guitar  colin greenwoods bass guitar similarly creeps in and out of earshot but sounds rush to fill the void scrolling up and down  i am born again that predated the facebook era by almost a decade 13 for me and tons of others this is the album equivalent of a gateway drug after connecting with it it became a mission to listen to the rest of radioheads discography listen to radioheads influences and then listen to anything that might bear passing resemblance to radiohead but like drugs every time i think i am done with it i put it on again and i realize how much i love every second of it and sometimes i get mad at the album because of how i winded up writing reviews for music on the internet that no ones going to read instead of getting a move on my life and then i get sort of bummed and i put on ok computer and it does not help me get unbummed it still sounds amazing while it is doing that though a,4.50,8289
rymfail fuckradiohead fuckapple fuckobamney fucknpr fuckikea fuckreligion fuckpolitesociety fuckarenarock about 7 years ago my friend john lent me his badly scratched up copy of this cd from his messy bedroom full of badly scratched cds and instruments and sculptural objects because i had never heard it before and it was so famous he was the drummer in make a rising and a trusted music head and the equally trustable jesse was there too saying yeah man this is like a 90s prog masterpiece so i said okay okay i will finally listen to this band actually i had heard radiohead once before in the 90s i was driving down to a college in maryland to hear noam chomsky give a talk and one of my close high school friends was driving and he was talking about this band that was so radical or subversive or righteous or something like that and he played some of their songs i am pretty sure that was before this album came out i remember thinking the music was pretty boring and that friend was a little mainstream in his taste while i had already gone way into avantgarde music and seen evan parker paul lovens and all kinds of stuff live my friend was still in some kind of mtv 90 minutes pseudoalternative music zone so i did not take his opinion seriously awesome guy though hey i met noam chomsky that day fuck radiohead but actually that song creep was pretty cool i think i heard it that day in my friends car so back to this album called ok computer so i borrowed the cd from john and played it in my car later that day i could not make it through the whole album but i listened to maybe all but the last two tracks i think before i gave up and put on some real music seriously if someone handed me an unlabelled cd and i did not know anything about this band i would listen to like two or three tracks and say okay it is a pretty nice mid 90s britpop spinoff very bland and uncreative sounds like a thousand other bands so it is not worth hearing any further but in actuality i was listening to this roundabout 2005 and at that time radiohead was a massively famous band and this album was massively popular and widely acclaimed occasionally acclaimed by respectable music connoisseurs eg some of my favorite rymers not just ignorant teenagers so given that context i felt compelled to listen to more than two or three tracks to hear what the fuss was about well i never heard it it was a pleasant poprock effort with some slightly aboveaverage production the fact is that i really do like this kind of music in general i grew up with it it is familiar and enjoyable i have heard a million things that sound like this and it is just mainstream culture fluff in my opinion anyway there is like two hundred bands in the 60s that made albums that blow this out of the water on every level this album should not even be in the alltime top 1000 on rym but i am just making a boring rant do not get me wrong i liked this album it was a solid 3 star album with 35 potential but the whiny vocals took it down a notch maybe someday i will try to listen to this album again and get all the way through i do not really doubt the positive testimonials of so many people oops i accidentally reached the end of this review without even mentioning axl rose one of my favorite singers maybe i will rewrite it sometime,3.00,3305

i am just patiently waiting for something else to take the top spot here at rym but who can angst harder than tom york time will tell,4.00,133
really the biggest problem i have with this is the same problem i have with other radiohead releases that this does not go for the jugular in trying to depress move or thrill me it just is it is like it is not trying hard enough and that sort of listless feeling is one i get from a lot of altrock that came after this album i cannot pretend i like what this influenced all that well either  but there is no denying that you can basically hear every trace of every modern rock band in this thing and that is pretty cool the guitars in particular actually stand out despite the fact that every band of this ilk since has unsuccessfully probably tried to ape them a common complaint about radiohead seems to be pretentious and i do not feel that at all here this feels like very honest music  like the band actually wanted to be responsible for what they were creating i like that even if the intent sometimes fumbling antiestablishment messages or grey slow down luddite stuff is not exactly what i prefer and you know what  even today we often need to be reminded of our place among machines and their place among us mostly however this is just some cool often inventive and diverse rock and that is what matters to be perfectly frank,3.00,1234
if i have to be totally honest i do not remember hearing about radiohead in the 90s maybe it is because at that time i was more interested in other types of music besides that few records cds or cassettes i think they still existed for 1997 and obviously the ones i bought were not going to be of a type of music that i was not interested in nor did i listen to much radio although in reality in my whole life there are few hours that i have dedicated to the radio so certainly i do not remember very well my history with radiohead in the 90s things did not change much a few years later when downloading discs with napster and stuff became fashionable cd piracy was also at its peak however i do not remember being interested in this band there either it was several years later  more or less in the mid00s almost a decade later when i remember having listened carefully to some of these english by that time they had already released three other albums by the way all very well received although obviously some more than others since i had not liked the little i had heard i decided to organize since until that moment i had single songs from different albums and that is when i thought that the best thing to do was to listen to a single album to understand the concept of the band and find that taste that many seemed to find it and i did not then an obvious question arose with which album to start since up to that moment the band had released 6 albums i thought that the best thing would be to start with the best  and that is how i made this ok computer when i heard it i just did not like it but seeing the wonders that many people talk about this band i thought that maybe if i listened to their two previous albums i could understand their evolution that was not the case i listened to ok computer and i still did not like it i listened to this album several times over several months i listened to it at different times of the day in different moods in different situations and never found it to be as good as many said finally i remember that for some time i listened to it at night and i found it to be an excellent sleeping pill the truth is that when i am awake it is a somewhat tiresome and boring album but all in all it is definitely not a bad album at all but it is not wonderful after several years trying to enjoy it i can only tolerate it and enjoy as such only a few songs,3.00,2396
this album is fucking incredible while many may accuse radiohead of making dry music or even poser shit i cannot identify with any of these viewpoints ok computer does an amazing job of making a soundtrack for the pains of modern life it is not the most innovative album ever made sure but it is undoubtedly unique and incredibly rewarding to listen to from the more popular songs such as airbag paranoid android karma police and no surprises to lessknown gems like exit music and climbing up the walls the delivery is just perfect it is music that washes over you,5.00,564
the most overrated music album of all time but it is still ok sorry for the fans but ok computer and wish you were here from pink floyd do not play in the same league fav tracks  karma police no surprises lucky,3.50,210
well shit this just became a 5star typical you know what the worst thing about consensus is it makes the people who do not agree with the consensus act like pricks i do not mean that in a complainer is always wrong sort of way i mean it in a this has a reputation for being the best ever and i do not think it is which makes me unique and special sort of way the poster child for this is citizen kane which has suffered from this possibly more than anything else ever has ever if i had a penny for every time i have heard yeah it is pretty good not the best film ever then i would have enough pennies to buy each of them a history of film college class and teach them why people say it is it drives me flatout insane on this site the equivalent in terms of artist is the beatles one side maintains that they are the greatest band to ever lay hands on instruments and the other side maintains that they are completely overrated and their popularity is more due to a cult of personality than any sort of actual musical or creative prowess as a huge beatles fan who maintains that they were incredibly flawed i get to sit in the middle and feel superior to both groups which is grand in terms of albums the citizen kane of music right now is ok computer and i will admit guilt in adopting the exact same stance that annoys me so much about the citizen kane naysayers i kept a certain sense of well they are very good i can see why people like it but it is not really the best album ever is it no much better stuff is out there and the masses just will not appreciate it what a pity also with the other sentiment of radiohead are good but they have not made the album they are capable of yet well call me wrong on both counts this is incredible and this is their album kid a could soon get there as well jesus even the songs i do not particularly like on this have their moments karma police is not my favourite but his voice on the chorus later on the way it shakes as it hits the high notes jesus fucking christ fitter happier somehow works why does it work it is a fucking 2 minute sound collage thing in the middle of a fucking alt rock album i would love to hate it on general principle but i cannot i like it it is the perfect end to karma police and the perfect leadin to electioneering oh yeah what is with everyone hating on electioneering is it because it sounds most like their old stuff more traditional the bends is sitting at number 60 right now it is not like people do not like their old sound apart from pablo honey not sure that really counts electioneering is one of the best songs i have heard i would call it the standout if not for the other standouts they are pretty much all standouts and standouts in twelve different ways well eleven different ways and exit music for a film still not convinced 100 on that one fuck still cannot believe i am 5starring this fuck,5.00,2883
the album cover should be put on a flag for the town that has the highest concentration of hipsters ok computer is the culmination of unethical music journalism and impressionable hipsters coming together for the sheer purpose of giving an otherwise subpar album godlike status most the songs on ok computer are composed like movie backdrops alot of radioheads fan base probably would not admit this because it makes the antisong structures on display sound less astounding well that is exactly the case here bands like pink floyd and yes were also known for utilizing song structures that deviated from the basic pop formula but yknow what separates these two bands from radiohead talent pink floyd and yes had enough of it to actually make their experiments a success radiohead on the other hand only need a few music publications to vouch on their behalf and inform the music listening public that their boring and messy experiments are actually groundbreaking works of genius,0.50,979
so much energy that you can let go of christmas instead of christmas carols lol,2.00,79
for some reason i always go into this album thinking i will have my mind blown for some reason that never happens it is a good album but that is about the extent of it edit i find some songs to be very good like paranoid android and let down but then there are others such as airbag electioneering no surprises and lucky that do very little for me,3.50,347
really a 2 star album so i am trying to get the average where it belongs i have tried to listen to this 5 times since i heard it was so great and stuff usually i get irritated or bored and stop it half way through there is one good song i cannot remember what its called the sound effects and talking robots are dated and were a bad idea to begin with this band has talent and even has some sorta vision but are just going through the motions here creep is an excellent song but that was on another cd,0.50,501
i did not want to judge this album never but on the spur of the moment you have to i never wanted to give her 1010 but it happened it is not even about the music layer it is a document of western civilization circa 1997,5.00,219
this album categorically does not deserve its place in the charts but i still put four because whatever you say but the record is very worthy,4.00,141
before you knock this off as another get out of the top spot review allow me to explain why i feel this album is average to fairly good at best i bought ok computer earlier this year with no real radiohead experience other than karma police creep paranoid android and exit music for a film pretty much the bare bones of what your average person may think of when asked about radiohead i felt let down pun not intended by the album after hearing such praise given to it from virtually every institution that would care to review it and i believe that this initial listen started off my relationship with this album on a bad note my first review of this album consisted of a three star rating and a complaint about a mediocre album being in the top spot on this site my first listen went a little like airbag only memorable as the opening track paranoid android song exit music karma police more use of the paranoid android voice a strong upbeat track no surprises song and last song the only part of this album that i really enjoyed besides the hits was electioneering which i thought was interesting because it was the only track that was straightforward rock so over the next few months i would play bits from the album and occasionally the entire album growing more accustomed to it i came to a point where i could see why people praised the album so frequently but i still did not get why it was at the top of so many best ever lists i also checked out more radiohead material finding this less accessible than the bends and more accessible than kid a and their other early2000s releases and definitely more impressive than what i had heard from the king of limbs then something interesting happened as i grew more and more accustomed to ok computer and radiohead in general this album flipped itself on its head i realized that i was listening to the tracks that i had passed off as filler more and listening to the tracks i was originally attracted to less despite having only known karma police paranoid android and exit music for little more than a year they suddenly feel as if i have heard them thousands of times i am tired of them as well as the increasingly bland subterranean homesick alien and no surprises when i first heard paranoid android i saw a comment on its video hailing it as the bohemian rhapsody of the 90s it was never that and now it feels more and more like a song made of the hurried fusion of multiple other songs it is not smooth in transitioning at all keep in mind that this was not a song that i fell in love with and listened to hundreds of times a day i would only listen to it every so often but enough about the hits everybody has already said everything that needs to be said about those a thousand times over this review is one of more than 1600 on this site alone after all one day recently i played airbag for lack of anything else that i wanted to hear i like to associate colors on album covers with the songs does anyone else do this on the album and whereas white is a symbol of boredom with subterranean homesick alien it suddenly became a symbol for a breath of fresh air on airbag had this song always sounded this good let down has a shimmering guitar sound and the second best chorus on the album only topped by the sensational i am born again on airbag this song is really where the intricate layering of the album comes into play electioneering has always been a nice track but only recently has climbing up the walls turned from filler at least in my eyes to manic energy lucky may just be may just be my favorite track on the album it has such a great pulsing sound and seems less trebly and more full soundwise a sound that would make so many tracks on this album even better the tourist is not really an ideal track and i see it as radioheads answer to the stooges la blues or death trip set over deep atmospherics it has a wild aspect to it even though there are lyrics it feels like yorke is just flowing with the music for most of the tracks here this album has very little replay value paranoid android may have been amazing and wholly awesome the first few plays but eventually it is time to move on to more interesting things as i mentioned before i like to associate the main color of the album cover with the sounds it contains within and it fits quite well here unfortunately ok computer has an alienating feel to it as a guitar player i have never been big on turning the treble up i prefer a warmer sound and that is how i feel about this album it is much too trebly and sounds hollow the prime offenders here are exit music for a film and subterranean homesick alien cover everything you want to in reverb but that does not mean that it will have full sound the deep reverb worked wonderfully on airbag but the band should have realized that not everything will work the same way if ever an album has suffered from a distinct lack of bass it would be this album even on metallicas and justice for all which has been criticized for having jason newsteds bass almost nonexistent in the mix the sound is deeper than what is presented on ok computer and that is a big issue for me as a listener i only just bought in rainbows today without hearing anything but 15 step and videotape and it is quite clear that radiohead understood their sound issue on this album in rainbows has such a full warm sound that makes most of ok computer tremble in comparison it does not mean that the alienating sound of this album should be removed but the full feel of songs like lucky should be explored on more tracks throughout the album possibly the biggest factor that stops this album from being the greatest of all time in my book is that none of the songs connect with the listener on a personal level radiohead were definitely up in the clouds during the making of ok computer as it is not an earthly or humanly album at all maybe that is the point  i have heard plenty of talk about this being based conceptually around technology but it could have been so much more there is no connection between the listener and the band which is what makes a great album a great album you can hear pain in tonights the night and nebraska you can hear the humanity in bitches brew come from a group of musicians playing together for the first time even in the classic pink floyd records you do not have to connect fully with the ideas of the mind breaking down or orwellian society but records like dark side of the moon and animals are submersive the listener can imagine that heshe can connect with them radioheads ok computer however is not as submersive nor is it something i can connect with yorkes lyrics are praised for their ambiguity but they are not interesting think of some of the best lyricists of all time none would make their songs so full of phrases and lines that do not go anywhere and at times yorkes falsetto is difficult to understand i can see that radiohead were trying to be as different as possible but i feel that it just did not work out as they had hoped overall ok computer is a collection of both good and bad tracks which tracks are which are entirely up to you and sometimes they might even surprise you as they did me but the good tracks while awesome still seem shallow and alienating it is not really the tracks themselves but the atmosphere and hollowness of the album that makes it a two star album it is certainly not the best album out there and hopefully i have been able to lay out a compelling case for such a point of view,2.00,7510
i was and still am an admirer of radiohead i would never subscribe to the notion of them being groundbreaking or particularly innovative but they have released some records that have pricked my ears up i was so eager to hear their new record after loving the bends that i took the day off work yes i am that old and queued up for this record on the day of it is release 14 years later and i am still reeling from the bitter disappointment that i felt on that day radiohead became tainted in my eyes and although the good will i have towards the band resurfaced upon subsequent releases it was never the same this record is the one that i avoid that day 14 years ago was the only time this record has had an emotional impact on me whenever i hear it i feel nothing whatsoever perhaps that is the point but personally i listen to music because i want to perhaps be enlightened to some degree and to this end gain some satisfaction maybe feel a certain way be it happy or sad desolate devastated angry or whatever variations of those states that you can come up with something at least i do not find the records message and themes particularly enlightening original engaging or engrossing either every generation has it is own thing it is own struggles the monotony and utter meaninglessness of what and who we are and what we do the absolute terror that our existence is when you pause and think about it for a minute it is nothing new records like this have been released for years previous to this one the production values here are poor and samey and i believe that sonically it has dated very badly much more so than the bendsand this record holds some of my least favourite radiohead songs electioneering for example seriously it sounds just like the stereophonics paranoid android is a great name for a song despite it is hitchhikers guide to the galaxy references which litter the record in fact but it is dull and lifeless and feels forced i can even hear the joins between movements which serves to cement my opinion that the record is badly produced the only 2 tracks i like on here are let down and fitter happier the bends kid a amnesiac hail to the thief in rainbows and king of limbs are much better records than this easily the most over rated release in the history of popular music classic records transcend their era become timeless ok computer does not accomplish this whatseover it is very much of it is time and very averagely so it is better than pablo honey though,1.50,2485
absurdoooooooooooo it is inexplicable how these easygoing depressive sound imitators are the number one album in history  according to this list of course i evoke a phrase from karl marx the common denominator of collective opinions is mediocrity i do not have anything personal against this band but i remember mtv when this album came out with their warhorse song with that endless boring video as for the musical little to say nothing complex nothing elaborate the vocal part is flat boring badly sung i could say an album that inaugurates an emotionally depressive and mediocre generation a shame for this page and for its voters hopefully this will change soon this shit cannot be the best album in the history of music this seems like an insult a joke what can be said about other rock bands like the beatles queen or soloists like pavarotti caruso kraus or top level jazz players or folk artists of unrivaled finesse who are surpassed by radiohead pfff i was never going to stop in my life to write about this but as a music lover and music critic i had a duty to society sorry if i offend the fans but above all free thinking and historical justice thanks and regards,0.50,1175
the most overrated thing in the history of rock the only almost listenable passage is pumped on sexy sadie by john lennon which poor man must be turning in his grave seeing that this shit is today ranked before revolver and abbey road most overrated thing ever,0.50,260
radiohead could have been a mere onehit wonder but with the bends they prove they are good enough musicians to produce interesting music they worked from now on with producer nigel godrich who understood well their ambitions ok computer is a concept album about the effects of technology on social interaction and the human experience it came just at the right time when cyberpunk was in the public conciousness and eerily anticipated the smartphone age leader thom yorke wrote melancholic songs that paint a doomed picture of the 21th century jonny greenwood the best musician in the band by far has the role of adding texture and interesting instrumentation to yorkes songs airbag is a hip hop and idm influenced track which would form the basis of their next album kid a paranoid android is the albums centerpiece in four movements like a rock sonata the first evolves around a flamencolike guitar riff the second is a hard rock riff the third is a slow apocalyptic movement and the finale simply reprise the hard rock part subterranean homesick alien fantasizes about alien abduction and recalls early pink floyd greenwood tricks with his guitars ring modulator exit music for a film is a dramatic song influenced by romeo and juliet and features a theatralic mellotron choir by greenwood let down is a beautiful polymetric guitar ballad with ultra depressing lyrics karma police is a cyberpunkish distopian song influenced by beatles essentially about a world with a social credit system ey fitter happier satirizes selfoptimizing with a computer voice electioneering is a noam chomsky tribute hard rock number climbing up the walls is inspired by modern classical a moody soundtracklike trip hop song no surprises musically is the odd one out a peaceful requiem for a suicidal man it has a brilliant riff doubled on guitar and glockenspiel it is the emotional center of the record lucky is an anthemic song about a plane crash the tourist makes a full circle with airbag it is about a car crash probably an allegory about technology as it is both the crashing car and the airbag it is a creative record musically and thematically it is one of the highest rated albums of all time 910,4.50,2189
in chile the youth knows radiohead either as a band for the depressed or as the creators of the saddest single of their lives creep chanted ad nauseam being that it is their least pleasant song not to say that it is the worst another part of the youth believes that it is a great band of alternative and experimental rock creators of the album the bends 1995 and above all of creating what many call the dark side of the moon of the 90s name given by the progres and some managers who only strive to bribe that is i am referring to his great work ok computer from 1997 the album opens with airbag one of the most sensational songs on the album that gives the sensation of going around in a spiral in a period in which you suffer and are saved from a miracle accident subterranean homesick alien is another of the great songs on the album along with the melancholy desperation of exit music for a film singles like paranoid android and karma police are sometimes boring but not if you listen to them along with the entire album which is sometimes not the case with no surprises climbing up the walls takes us to a gloomy despair especially with the heartbreaking cry at the end thom yorke sure knows how to put his voice for each occasion something imitated by characters such as chris martin from coldplay or matthew bellamy from muse for not say the genius of guitarists johnny greenwood and ed obrien colin greenwoods bass and phil selways drums a team that when they get together can create incredible things except in pablo honey his most mediocre album lucky had appeared on the charity album the help album and it all culminates with the tourist a somewhat calmer track another amazing thing is fitter happier where in a style something similar to a stephen hawkins they speak to us with a spectral background after the group would take four years to release the good kid a with a radical change in its sound but this album will be remembered as the pinnacle of 90s rock and a great influence for that indie rock that governs us even reggae has not been exempt from the influence of radiohead if not listen to radiodread by easy star allstars it is simply an album that you cannot miss in your collection,4.50,2210
in the past radiohead were simply one of those bands that made me question why so many people respect them as musicians i only heard a few songs from them to sum it up i was completely ignorant when it came to their music but now that i am at a point in my life where i have listened to so many different bands i gave these guys a chance by making ok computer my introduction to their music ok computer took quite a while to grow on me i could tell the music was good but i still did not understand why this band and this record is so highly respected so i listened deeply again and again and i realized the songs have such a huge impact and saying that is an understatement the music on this record moved me in a way like no other record has and that really says a lot coming from me listening to this record is haunting once you give it a proper listening the thing i really love about ok computer is the vast amount of awesome song writing i wish i could create riffs like these jonny greenwood is now one of my top favorite guitarists what i like about him is that his guitar playing sounds like it was influenced by pink floyd and the pixies this is an album in which people would argue that it is derivative but even though one can easily trace the influences the end product still feels like something new and unique not only musically but lyrically this record shines the focal point of the lyrics seem to be on the rise of technology having a stronger hold on society but it more or less seems to generally touch upon the alienation that many go through trying to live in the western society this is reminiscent to the themes that are covered in many punk rock records but when you combine these heavy themes with the melancholic sound of radiohead you get the same message but galvanizing in a way that feels more poignant the way the words are delivered by thom yorke really brings out the depth of the lyrics and the music not only that but the whole band shines as a unit contrary to the despondent tone of the themes touched upon in the lyrics soundwise the music to me surprisingly sounds like music for a beautiful day there are moments where the album goes into darker territory from exit music to climbing the walls but songs like let down and especially the tourist are what really drives the tone of the record ok computer is like a long lonely walk through a beautiful sunny metropolitan area and nothing else brings me back to the 90s as much as this album,5.00,2478
this is a great pop album it took a few listens to enjoy this to its fullest i think why it took so long for me to like the album the way i do now is because of the outrageous amount of unjustified praise it has the album is great like i have already underlined but why oh why best album ever radio head brings nothingnothing new to poprockmusic with these songs admit it its charm is found in the vocal instrument and timing simplicity and some cool atmospheric sounds that said the vocals are not well sung the lyrics are goofy and make no sense so much effort went into being cute every single moment of every single song its like being force fed a whole pint of honey in less than 30 seconds it is nice and sweet but toward the end your going to choke and vomit and just maybe never be able to enjoy honey again pet shop boys are much better in all facets and they have been doing this much longer i would recommend this album to anyone but 5 stars never,3.00,958
let us come peacefully to the fact that is neither completely devoid of value nor the cutting edge of the 90s,2.50,109
ok computer an album that garners so much respect and yet so much hate no matter ones opinion of it ok computer is a milestone in the history of modern music it did not completely revolutionize modern music nor did it introduce any novel style what it did was blend a variety of influences ranging from pink floyd and david bowie to pixies and even miles davis yorke has stated that the sounds of bitches brew fundamentally influenced the creation of this album with creative zeal and seamless execution all packaged in an accessible yet sonically varied alternative rock sound this mix proved to be just right for the time as it was almost immediately received as a modern classic the popularity they had gained from pablo honey and the respect they had received from the bends secured ok computers popularity but its reputation far exceeds anything that came about from those two albums say what you will about any of its pretensions of which there are many what radiohead accomplished here is no small feat this is no average alternative rock album structurally it flows with subtle progressions utilizing many layers of sound to produce an inviting yet intricate atmosphere while kid a and amnesiac would be electronic albums at heart this is still a rock album at the core the electronic elements simply add flavor to the mix accentuating greenwood and obriens simple yet highly effective guitar chords and harmonies and yorkes passionate vocal delivery and lyrics the lyrical themes themselves are sufficient for a fulllength review but i will leave that study in postmodern social commentary to more accomplished critics my only significant gripe here is that the album grows slightly tiring after no surprises as the last two tracks sound like filler more than anything else although the tourist has its moments in other words screw the haters this deserves respect,5.00,1873
beautiful amazing stunning great work atmospheric i am sorry i cannot find more words for that album it is just full of great songs the best way to enjoy it late at night with headphones and if it is possible while sitting in the car or bus empty road rainy weather that is an amazing experience best songs of the great songs paranoid android subterrenean homesick alien karma police,5.00,383
have you ever had someone tell you that something is the greatest thing ever maybe your friend thought inception was the best movie of all time maybe your girlfriend says that the dq blizzard she is enjoying is the best thing ever she is probably getting fat and you do not like that maybe someone is saying that some album by radiohead is the best thing to happen to music ever or at least since the 60s perhaps it is not just one person perhaps it is a whole bunch of people perhaps it is everyone that is the way it is for ok computer i am not just talking about rym either actually rym is not even the place where this band is worshiped the most which is insane considering this album seems to bounce around the top 3 on the rym charts here that is also quite fascinating to me as well i have never actually really listened to radiohead but the fact that an album from 1997 is rivaled only by a couple of albums by the beatles for overall rating on this website is pretty amazing living under my rock and listening only to my emperors my neurosises and my other metals it still is kind of hard for me to understand how an album can be so universally loved i know a lot of people i am mostly talking about the people who listen to music thoroughly not your garden variety eminem fans who do not like some of the other top albums from around here like bob dylan pink floyd and led zeppelin with radiohead i have 40 friends on this site who have rated ok computer and their ratings actually average out to an amazing 449 8th highest rated album by my rym friends and remember that i listen to almost exclusively metal over half of those ratings are 5 star ratings too does it live up to it is praise well i am not expecting it to this is not really my favourite type of music i have listened to this band in small doses before youtubing them or just listening to a song here and there out curiosity to see if they really are all that they would never really grabbed me all that much sure paranoid android is pretty awesome but i did not find anything close to that in quality then i heard airbag and that changed my attitude towards this album quickly changed from cautious and a little bit skeptical to a sort of surprised excitement two songs in this album is awesome the last ten songs however do not match up in individual quality not even close that is okay though this is an album that i know if i listened to any song on it is own i would not enjoy it nearly as much as i would if i was listening to the album in it is entirety this has probably been said before and often but this is an album it is not a collection of songs it is meant to be listened to as a whole and it works best as a whole the mood and the flow of this album is actually pretty incredible to be honest i was actually less than impressed with this album my first listen i was a little more impressed with my second listen it seems to be how it works with people though this is an album that grows and i would expect it to grow a little bit more on me i do not think i could ever understand the personal connections or how much this album means to some people but i at least understand a little bit why this album is so popular,4.00,3206
writing a review for ok computer should be like shooting fish in a barrel all you have to do is throw around words like experimental weird sparse lush depressing classic magnum opus and my personal favorite messy masterpiece and just like that you have a cookiecutter review which is socially acceptable to just about all of your trendy friends what is really funny about that previous paragraph is all the terms used above are spot on ok computer is depressing let down no surprises ok computer is experimental paranoid android ok computer is sparse exit music the tourist ok computer is lush airbag subterranean homesick alien ok computer is weird fitter happier climbing up the walls ok computer is all those things and more thus the album has come to take on a history of its own you would be hard pressed to find a legitimate greatest albums list that does not have this towards the top and rightfully so it is the kind of album that makes a band and one that can often pigeonhole how the hell do you top this for radiohead it was exploring their sound to a profound extreme while still being considered rock kid a is a great result of the frustration of trying to top something that they could not as for ok computer it is the kind of album that taken piecemeal feels as though it cannot work but somehow the track numbering is right on and the album became a symbol for the frustration of the 90s and who could argue this is as good as it gets,5.00,1450
it seems outrageous to me to even suggest that this is the best album in history but despite everything it is still a great album,4.00,129
and what will happen if i look you in the eye and told ya that i loved ya yeah well it is not the kind of thing that you think of when it all comes down to wires we are gurgling up into the ether now humming tourselves in crisp night air we are listening to radiohead yes radionhead theyyou are were a very popular band between about 1990 ad annie dawson and 2013 same before everything changed in a big stock market crash omg omg is this a creative writing review i hope not though they can be good it is just that is not what i am in the mood for right so agnes hi i am richard i come from connecticut where i sell trinkets in at a big yellow stand by twelfth street i listened to the radio head album once i was fifteen and very sick and pressed up against the window smiling i think i quite liked it it made me think of warm places i was sick you remember i remember the summer the clipped blue those little streets wotsit like to be sick you say well i say everything floating and then summer and the blue upbove and thinking i will never betray this this perfect moment ashy redblue in skies i could do it just now but this album betrays the moment yes i accuse it of treason to the moment what i look for in the very end is a kind of fidelity that holds an i love you delivered at 001 that clings til whenever it all comes crashing down over and this is what you could never do thom and everyone else you could give me no surprises you could give me those bits of airbag you could reach at something you could find something in those little moments but could yuou give me what they gave me and could you give that afternoon i first heard it when everything could have when she and i and when the and i was and it was and i am tired of it there is a kind of transcendence that maybe i will never have a need to feel a refined need for taking shelter in the with the i yes okay i will admit it you get me in bits and pieces but it is and she is and he is and they are and they are beckoning it is that golden sky we are the moment thom you are not giving it is a body without a soul or a soul without a body will i ever grow to see that it is all i grew alright but not in the way you expected every speech is ultimately about the speaker and every work of art ultimately says more about its audience than it is creator i nicked that sentiment from oscar wilde and you are saying nothing to me saying it well perhaps but i do not think that what you think is happening is happening but i do not have to agree but give me a true love i can feel what hi i am it is edit what the fuck,2.00,2586
so if for whatever reason you have not heard of this record or if you are not convinced of it is greatness i urge you to listen to it it is radioheads best record and arguably the best record of the 90s what is left to say about it every song not including the interlude fitter happier but nobody ever includes that one is great the albums first six songs is up there with the best first half of any record airbag starts pretty abruptly and it is a bit of a difficult record to take in all at once  the angular guitars of airbag leading into the shapeshifting classic paranoid android into the spacey subterranean homesick alien and then into the tense claustrophobic exit music and it does not let up from there every song sets its own distinct mood maybe except for electioneering a more straightforward rocker even if it is a great song buy it and you will find yourself playing it over and over again,5.00,904
the best album ever period i remember borrowing this album off a friend because it had paranoid android on it i listened to it on a walkman and at that time i was more into heavier rock but this album just grew and grew on me it never dates just gets better with repeated listens i have the privilege of seeing them live twice quite simply opened my eyes to different areas of music the album flows from start to finish it is sheer perfection,5.00,442
if asked before relistening to this album yesterday what my favourite radiohead album was i would have answered the bends in a shot now now i remember what i would forgotten  that ok computer was and is one of the truly great works of the last 30 years with the lone exception of fitter happier which now just seems trite and pointless each song is worthy of 5 stars on its own merit  although i agree that electioneering does not seem to fit on the album in terms of its musical structure if not lyrical content this could be down to its placement as the next song after the aforementioned fitter happier each song is a great song of alienation loneliness state control and a jaded feel on politics  particularly impressive when you recall it was released at the height of the new labour spin movement when tony blair moved into number 10 the prophet yorke saw through the lies highlights they are all highlights but let us have a little love for the oftforgotten climbing up the walls and let down as well as the more infamous paranoid android karma police no surprises and exit music magic stuff,5.00,1098
has been the top album of rym for quite a while not overrated in the slightest an absolute masterpiece,5.00,102
many times have a tried to right a review for this album but i know that nothing i can say will live up to what this masterpiece truly is here in my opinion is the last physical classic album in an age when technology was advancing every so rapidly this is probably and always will be one of the most fullfilling listening experiences i have ever had why do i say this you may ask well let me break it all down for you and tell you why i became obsessively addicted to this fine piece of era defining rock music let me get this straight in saying that this album is extremely unique and there is nothing like it that borders on the creative experimental force of electronic effects and compelling guitar riffs the beatles came very close to this and are probably the closest piece of music i could relate this to let us just say it feels like a mix of pink floyds dark side of the moon and the beatles revolver ok computer is nothing short of a monumental and could be regarded as one of the best albums of all time to music critics kid a is also a masterpiece in its own right but i feel as if this being more rock oriented ok computer is extremely cool but besides that the lyrics are extremely personal and relatable here thom yorke has moved on and matured in his songwriting once again we see thoms writing to be weak in pablo honey at times until we reach to there second release the bends i feel as if the bends talk about relationships in a more mature manner then pablo honey while the bends is a deeply personal record ok computer is personal but feels distant it actually feels like thom is talking to the modern man themes of isolation in his lyrics are more prominent then ever before if you really listen to the bends and i mean really listen you can see this coming the end of nice dream has effects to it near the end that will show up all of the time in ok computer bullet proof i wish i was has effects that add and complete the song also so let us get to the album from johnnys guitar riff in the beginning of airbag you just know that this album is going to be epic from the get go the drumming is what really stands out in this track it is almost like a machine and carries the song throughout with a bass line that is unpredictable but what really grabs me about this song is song is the imagery i actually get an adrenaline rush every single time i listen to this song i feel like i am traveling down the highway in a car going 80 miles an hour the song is about surviving a car crash like a sudden wake up to yourself in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe you feel as if you are invincible and its like a sudden realization that death could happen at any minute and i could die so i need to live life to the fullest radioheads music is known as depressing but this song is the most uplifting song i have ever listened to the effects at the end create such a futuristic atmosphere that it feels like the music is alive and just i do not know how to put itdancing this music is alive paranoid android feels eery from the beginning but the way this track builds and changes keeps you on your feet the entire time it is like bohemian rhapsody only 10x better it feels extremely cold and lost as the computer voice talks to you saying i may be paranoid but i am no android ambition makes you look pretty ugly we as humans crave ambition but thom is going against this idea an notion almost every american craves in modern society johnnys guitar riffholy shit it grabs you and pulls you in and transcends into an ultimate explosion until it reaches a human plea a final stand as if you feel as if you are kneeling to god asking for one last chance to change it around begging for mercy as if something from the heavens will reach you and touch you and take you away from the craziness of reality beautiful stuff guysfirst time i heard it i was utterly speechless and it moved me to tears subterranean homesick alien is about a man who is bored and tired with his normal life he feels as if there must be something more out there he cannot relate to the people around him and wants to get out of his town were he feels like he is stuck and his fate to die there there all uptight uptight he cannot stand the life around him this song reminds me of my parents how there lives suddenly become dull and uptight about everything because they feel as if there safe if they are worrying all the time and do not always understand what is important in life they need to let loose so sometimes i do feel like i just want aliens to take me away in a sense and start a new life to see what really is out there to go away and disappear to somewhere far away because i do not feel like a belong here creep reference but sometimes i want to scream this song to adults who are uptight with there old age they become worn down by modern society exit music for a film so so haunting its about romeo and juliet telling her that its time to leave there families and start there own life together and never see them again but there parents are blinded by the fact that they love each other because they have there differences and absolutely hate each other they tell each other to calm down because they are so angry at there family for not knowing how they feel breathkeep breathing do not lose your nerve there families hate there love so in turn they hate there own family they cannot breath without each other so if one dies they both die because they are one sing us a songa song to keep us warm there is such a chill such a chiilll then the creepy kid voices come in and i feel extremely cold and hopeless i feel frozen to the spot we hope that you chokethat you choke wow those lyrics are unreal and filled with so much anger and coldness let down probably my favorite song on the album so sad but at the same time feels so beautiful and uplifting the piano and the off kilter time signature is beautiful going back to the them of transportation every time i am in a carplane or train listening to this it fits the mood perfectly as you look at the window in your car you see the highway in front of you cars moving past your face and thinking about how some of those people might feel driving home from a long day at workalone the expectations of millions of people at once feeling let down because it did not live up to what it thought it would you simply let down again and it happens every single day it happens over and over until you become cold hearted she will of a person you simply are worn out by life in general your clinging on to things that you make you happy but which in turn you are not feeling the love and emotion you once felt as a child the computer bleeps at the end and the crascendo build up to a magnificent focal point you know where you are with floor collapsing falling bouncing back and one day i am going to grow wings a chemical reaction again saying that one day you are going to escape all of this but it may never happen karma police has to deal with how we curse other people saying that we want bad things to happen to certain people that put us down praying that justice will soon catch up with them and in turn there is a balance in the universe he is different so i do not like him her hitler hairdo is making feel illhe talks in maths he is a jew therefore i cannot love him he is black so we cannot see eye to eye and you cursed me to hell damn you all burn in hell because i never did anything to you it is never my fault it is always yours begging for some force to damn them this is what you get when you mess with us but then he realizes he is at fault for calling on the karma police to get them therefore he in turn is just as evil as the person persecuting him phew for a minute i lost myself he feels as if he is losing his mind why are bad things happening to me if i did not do anything wrong so it buzzes in his head and never stopshes going crazy if he believes in karma why is it happening to him fitter happier the ideal way a person should be trying to as perfect as possible and comfortable and safe as we try to perfect ourselves we become dull and fake the media shows us false information on how we should really be if we want to live a full and happy life but we become stuck in routines and like a computer programmed to do what we are told by the media we become lost because everyone else is behaving in this same manner so we behave in the same manner as everyone else in society to fit in but the person is like a pig in a cage no matter what he can never escape he was programmed from birth to behave in a certain way it is telling us this is how we should live our life do not listen rebel against the same be unpredictable and do not get stuck in routine because it will kill you electioneering politics that are not for the people the canidate will stop for nothing he will say the right things even though he probably will not act upon them when he is in office i go forwards and you go backwardsand somewhere we will meet sarcastic view on how the republican and democratic party will see eye to eye and get things done but in reality nothing really gets down when both sides are fighting this is the ultimate political protest song with johnny once again showcasing his insane guitar ability although i feel as if this could have fit on the bends better it is the only weak point on the whole album not saying that its filler but something else like something off of airbag how am i driving ep could have fit this spot better in my opinion i am going to sum it up here and talk about four songs to wrap it up in one paragraph because i know this is to long of a review climbing up the walls is about someone who is depressed and cannot fight it away it may be about thoms own depression again a bleak outlook saying that there is no escape that the person himself is depression and it is who they are no suprises is one of the singles and has a beautiful tune just as let down has but talks about a man commiting suicide by turning on his car in his garage and killing himself with carbon monoxide poisoning the man in the album has become so cold and lifeless that he finds no point in living anymore in this material world lucky is a sarcastic view on how things will change but probably never will the tourist is like the exact opposite of airbag slow moving and its almost like the world flashing before your eyes before you crash that everyone in the world needs to slow down and look at the world around them do people ever question what is going on around them do we ever take the time to smell the flowers and love life before it all slips away do not worry and the troubles in your life are only temporary live life to the fullest troubles are not the end of you i feel as if the story is about a man who saw life as depressing and a terrible place to be and went crazybut never really stopped the craziness in time tragic but we all feel like this the computer crashed 1010,5.00,10979
the only good song is sexy sadie radiohead  most overrated music act of all time too bad there is no 00 that is what it is worth,0.50,128
i was merely a six year old urchin when this album came out my dad purchased it on cassette and used to play it constantly from 6pm until about 9pm i would randomly eat cereal late at night in the dining room whilst fitter happier more productive would come on and make me think i was going to die early by eating sugary cereal that i would eventually burst to tears if you buy this album do not let your children eat cereal near it you wanted a real review well like everyone else has already said they already said that everything has already been saidever so take my advice and if you buy the album just keep what i said in mind whilst listening to thom yorke do his falsetto thingy as jonny greenwood goes on airbag duhruuuundunnnndaaaaahdooooodoooo etc,4.00,757
it is not bad but it is by no means the best album in the history of music i think its position is inflated by people who never heard better things because of a generational issue simply,3.50,186
there is not anything i can say about this album that will not sound like utter hyperbole i have been madly and hopelessly in love with it for the past 13 years in that time i have easily listened to each song will over 1000 times each and not one of them have gotten old yet if you do not love this album you obviously have not really listened to it if i were to make one criticism this album would have been 100 perfect if the tourist was in between karma police  electioneering and fitter happier was the intro also as much as i love the beatles how exactly does anything on abbey road or revolver match the beauty contained in this album i just do not see it,5.00,662
it should be number 1  but people like these 2 assholes below tend to rate low just because they do not think okc should be at number 3  instead of rating the music  this is fuckin 5 stars music  like it or not ,5.00,211
it reads february 28 2007 or should i say it actually reads like this an instant immortal classic 1997 album was radioheads 3rd and clearly the best this is really the best album of a band that clearly makes the best music lovers of the bends might be contrary to my opinion but apart from that album ok computer contributed more to the music world clearly this album most be in a better place than number 9 oh that was me this month this will become three years old this dates back to my first entry ever written for this page like if i needed something else to make this a special album for me now it is also a milestone of how things have changed rym has changed its appearance has added lots of new features and has been growing in number of members and their interactions with the site and oh yeah ok computer was at 9 me i was 15 years old back then easy to be impressed and quite a bad reviewer i believe i have improved nowadays though i am still sore for not having a front page review anyways ok computer is still one of my favorite records though nowadays i have reconciled myself with lovers of the bends and i am actually one of them now although my emotions overcame me on that review i acknowledge the album itself had a lot to do the music is intriguing not really letting you know what it is about though you somehow get to comprehend it filled with emotionally charged songs and great songwriting this is really a modern classic and even if many people around think it is lame to like radiohead get over these guys have already proven their worth,5.00,1564
yorke and greenwood grow into musical adults and earn themselves a label of best british band for the nineties riding along with the happy hell that comes with greatest album of all time and the beatles and floyd fans who scream in purplefaced indignation waving their preferred classic albums like revolutionaries paranoid electrorock which is not quite electrorock at all it is awesome and full of deus ex machina moments so unaware of themselves that one wants to laugh hysterically,4.50,485
what a stunner it creates a whole new dimension that had never been heard before in music upon its 1997 release it is very complex there is something new and nice to hear each listen and i continue to be amazed by the rich sound landscape still after all my listens it is not the best album to listen to if i am in a happy mood i got to be at least somewhat down or else i will turn it off after a song but on headphones speakers whatever and the perfect melancholic mood it always sounds great every song is a masterpiece in that state of mind with the possible exception of fitter happier but that one is designed to help the album along its theme and the reason is radiohead had gained the ability to see their ability with the bends and this was the next natural step while i do not consider it to be the best album ever radiohead hit every single note right with ok computer this is what transformed 5 boys from abingdon oxfordshire into men that could compose at a 1000 feetsecond,5.00,986
ale another 5 stars for one of those who is always among the first let us see if it is so high and voted by so many people it must be for a reason right this yes was simply the best album of the 90s the music needed a breath of fresh air something new and innovative that no one expected something that hit hard and redefined the guidelines if we analyze the decades of music we see how this has always happened so sooner or later someone had to do it and that someone was radiohead at a time when grunge began to invade everywhere at a time that nobody expected that the curl of originality could be curled even more but to redefine the guidelines you have to dig deep and the best formula is to have really good songs that reach people and damn if it did the experiment worked like a charm maybe in part because of this eclectic compact of styles and likes something big was happening and radiohead was beginning to become a legend airbag is the best yorke comes out here with that constant voice before a beautiful song if you have to make beautiful songs they should be like that at least paranoid android was a complete success with its original composition mixing a kind of latin rhythm and electronic paranoia to end in nostalgia let down made us want to finish everything at once it encouraged us greatly and it is impossible for me to imagine someone who has not gotten up from their seat when they heard it screaming out what we want that is making one of these songs that they rise little by little with a lot of class karma police is an atypical song and perhaps a masterpiece because so much can be said in just a few minutes after a cut you want to move your skeleton to later become geek in a good way with so much beauty and end up calm and relaxed after this trip that you still cannot believe great that is my only word that can come out to understand this album we have to analyze it more compositionally since many of us would like to have such great ideas in such a short time and put them together on an album compositionally it is a perfect album balanced and well thought out you have to look further to understand the masterpieces and if you do this we add what it meant for a culture because it seems like the thing is almost impossible bravo,0.50,2268
i really wish i could have listened to this album without the awerness of the whole hype that surrounds it because of that i expected god knows what kind of uberepiphany that will change my life forever what i have got is an average alt rock record with extremely annoying vocals and pseudointellectual lyrics musicwise it is basically the same stuff as on the bends with occasional trip hop beats in the background and as on radioheads previous effort there are some decent songs with really pretty melodies and even interesting structure however most of the tracks lose their momentum after a minute or so or are just plain bad electioneering the only exception that i honestly like is the opening airbag and just as before the thing that makes this album practically unlistenable for is thom yorkes unbearable voice most of the time he sounds like a crying little boy deprived of his favourite teddy bear some time ago with occassional fits of hysteria when he remembers how much he loved that bear also the lyrics criticizing the yuppie culture and dehumanization of man if i got that right are average at best to sum up there is a hint of evolution in the introduction of elements of trip hop but apart from that the band copies their winning in terms of sales formula from the bends the fact that this is the highest rated album on rym is astonishing highlight  airbag lowlights  fitter happier we all know it is fun to play with the voice synthesizer but come on  electioneering just a very poor song  climbing up the walls yorkes whining at its worst,2.00,1558
have i finally crossed the point of no return i have been interested should i put that in radiohead for a number of months now not to say i like the band just interested why everyone rates them so highly among those elite music circles i have ever heard one person say radiohead is music now that is some quote to live up to and with that i actually spend money and bought this record i am not sure totally why anyway now for that review the album starts off with airbag and before i actually listened to this album fully i listened to this song countless times for me it sounded really good so it obviously urged me on to listen to the album as a whole and get my full opinion of it there are a few other songs worth noting on this album which for me makes it listenable even if i do not like the album has a whole why does half the album quickly go sour half way through i am all up for diversity but this is not as good as i would of thought in summary i like this album but i feel the some songs do better separately than all together do not get me wrong i actually like some of the stuff here just together it feels a little weaker for a glimpse this album has proved one fact i want to listen to more i am not sure on what as attracted me to this album just yet maybe the catchy arty moments it has i do not know yet anyway the band are on my radar now i will have to listen to more radiohead to get an idea if i actually like them,3.00,1437
in my humble opinion this is the best album ever recorded no not just by radiohead but by any band in the history of music there is no question about it when i listen to this album it completely transforms me it is the only album i have ever listened to that makes me absolutely float in air it is almost a religious experience to listen to this album every song on the album is unbelievably good however i will rank my top 5 below in order 1 let down 2 exit music 3 karma police 4 paranoid android 5 airbag,5.00,507
i hate it when people give this album like 12 a star and say that its so over rated and thom yorke has an annoying voice then they go ona rant about how its so overplayed and the corporations are all corporationy and some say that if you listen to it without the hype than its not actually very good bull shit its an incredible album and maybe its not the best album ever but its worth 5 stars maybe 3 12 stars if you did not really get it i get pissed off when people try to be different by giving an incredible album a terrible review you cannot say this is the worst album ever and it deserves less than half a star unless you are looking for attention because no matter how you look at it this is at least a good album in my opinion its a fantastic album but its not a crap album anybody who uses the word overrated deserves to burn in hell,5.00,844
they said soundscape textured layered i say boredom the most overrated album in rock era listen the whole album at once could put you in a state that could take you weeks to get out just paranoid get some light but quickly back to mediocrity like drforknspooner said in the previous review,2.50,289
radiohead 1997 ok computer beats 30 good 512 exclude 7 interlude airbag karma police the tourist lucky electioneering radiohead rh is a rock band from abingdon uk consisting of lead singerguitarist thom yorke ty  instrumentalists whose instruments include guitar drums piano  electronic production this is rhs 3rd studio album  1st that i have reviewed vocals 05 ty is a mediocre singer with a decent voice yet mediocre unintelligible annunciation i recommend skipping this  instead listening to pearl jam 1993 vs,2.50,513
what this album really lacked is substance yes substance i found it to be dull and uninspiring i am probably suppose to enjoy this because i listen to a lot of alternative and alternativerock there was maybe a moment or 2 during no surprises and lucky where i thought maybe there could be something to this album i put headphones on for a little while to see if there was something beneath the prominent sounds the result was very little to nothing i tried enjoying this album really,0.50,483
radiohead finally truly find there sound amazing but not quite the perfection of there next record nor is it the greatest record of all time but it is nice to see this album at 1 instead of some shitty beatles record,4.00,216
so it is finally come to thisthe album proclaimed by so many overprivileged white teens and 20something is to be the greatest recording ever created by man i remember when i was in high school i worked with a guy at a supermarket yes obviously it was whole foods that told me he wanted to destroy his stereo and shatter his eardrums after listening to ok computer because nothing else he would ever hear in his life could possibly compare to what he had just experienced needless to say i was skeptical and growing up in white suburbiathis album was the favorite of the majority of my classmates and i tried my hardest to resist it is evil pull by the time college came around i cautiously gave this dangerous album a listen and was completely underwhelmed the hype built around this behemoth was immeasurable and the product while certainly well written and decently executed simply did not resonate with me the way it had with so many of my peers ok computer has a lot of great tracks airbag paranoid android exit music for a film karma police etc and to be fair none of the songs are bad at least objectively but i have wrestled for years on what separates this album from some of my favorite albums i recently came up with a few reasons why i do not consider this to be one of the greatest albums of all time or even the decade 1 radiohead is too subtle with much of their overdubbinglayeringnow the vocal layerings for the most part are flawless but the guitar overdubs are often downplayed and too subtle to even follow i often do not even notice that they are there i understand that this is part of the mystique and atmosphere of the album but come onquite pretentious 2 i think thom yorke had a root canal during fitter happier because he seems incapable of enunciating words on the second half of the albumi mean the band might as well have had the lead singer of sigur rs for tracks 812because i have no idea what he is singing half the time 3 the track the tourist just endsso many of the tracks have very downplayed and subtle buildups and then stop abruptly the final track is no exception and stands out more because it is the last track 4 after a discussion with my buddy chuck rym user aborodin i realized that one of the biggest problems with the album is that there is no real moment of catharsis radiohead teases you with big buildups and flashes of emotional expulsions on paranoid android and karma police specifically but there is no moment on this album where i get a shiver down my spine and feel completesome examples of what i mean are as follows the guitar breakout at the end of only in dreams on weezer blue album the string buildup at the end of still life on dog man star the climactic ode to joy chorus from beethovens 9th symphony the guitar solo on stairway to heaven from led zeppelin iv quite possibly my favorite musical movement of all time the final verse as sure as eggs is eggs of suppers ready from foxtrot and the subsequent guitar fill by steve hackett cannot you feel our souls ignite shedding ever changing colours in the darkness of the fading night like the river joins the ocean as the germ in a seed grows we have finally been freed to get back home there is an angel standing in the sun and he is crying with a loud voice this is the supper of the mighty one the lord of lords king of kings has returned to lead his children home to take them to the new jerusalem now that is catharsis and in the end that is really what ok computer lacksnb not every album requires such a musical feat but for title of greatest album of alltime you certainly do for all it does right this is a great collection of songs and ironically for all of it is overproduction it just feels incompletebut hey at least it is better than kid a a really good album and a mustlistenjust not the best of the decade great mmm,4.00,3845
i had to listen to this all the time in my art class after many plays i can say without a doubt that i find the material to be mediocre nothing more nothing less the production is good there is a considerable amount of variation in terms of textures and oscillations and the like but nothing really strikes a chord with me i am sure my senior year classmates in art would berate me for saying this but honestly i think this is one of the most overrated bands ever if you want more art rock i would suggest you listen to something like talking heads,2.50,548
this is the best album that has ever been made i will not listen to any dissenting opinions if you disagree you should see a psychiatrist this plays like the best concert you could think of starting with the power chord at the beginning of airbag to the final triangle ding of the tourist there are no songs on here that are skip worthy the closest being fitter happier it is an album that can not be surpassed for at least another 25 years the best gift you can give anyone in music,5.00,483
ok computer is a great album and more than enough has been written to justify why that is so whether you want to call it the album of the 90s or album of the century people who love this album can agree that it is prophetic in its vision and it is completely unique sounding even for the time it certainly withstands the test of time however it is also very misunderstood when i first listened to this as a highschooler i hated every second of it and i did not even complete the album this was also true of the 2nd 3rd and 4th times i listened to it i hated thoms stupid highpitched nasally voice i hated how his name was thom spelt like that i hated the depressing nature of the lyrics all i wanted was some music with some ooomph and ok computer was not cutting it looking back it is strange how i did not like it because this album is equally as angsty as i was at the time i eventually came to realize that there are a lot of powerful ooomphy songs on here but they do not deliver oomph the same way as some of radioheads radio cohorts do a failing of modern rock radio if you ask me i kept giving it periodic tries trying to believe the hype then one day when i was in my early 20s it finally clicked i liked the whole thing front to back and totally got it it was full of sound and soul of helplessness and desperation of buildups and crashes of torture and serenity what changed the world changed broadband internet and streaming video was the norm smartphones became ubiquitous social media made us all feel simultaneously connected and isolated i certainly was older but age is not what helped me like the album listening to ok computer is not like reading siddhartha broad musical exposure definitely helped but that was not it either weed definitely helped but that was not it it also was not coming to the realization of how much it reminds me of the wall i was 7 when this album came outwhy did i appreciate it now what ultimately did it was this realization we live in an increasingly anxious and isolated s o c i e t y now go angsty teen who thinks thom yorkes voice makes him sound like a whiny bitch go listen to ok computer with headphones on you will realize that he is a whiny bitch just like we all are you will get tingles on your skin when thom screams at the top of his lungs at the end of climbing up the walls you will cry after the bridge of let down you will appreciate the slow buildup of exit music for a film and your jaw will drop when you figure out it was for some shitty leo dicaprio romeo  juliet movie you will think it is powerful and poignant and entirely appropriate for our times you will fucking get iteventually,5.00,2654
shit i was hoping to be the first person to review this album but someone got there before me when i first heard this i thought radiohead were the most significant and interesting british rock band since the days of cream and soft machine but i was not sure that i actually liked them my problems i do not like the inexpressive singing  there are times when inexpressive singing can be effective lou reed for instance whose voice seems unable to hold any emotional content but that suites the deadpan horrors of his songs we are never sure whether he is being ironic or not  but here i just find it a long whinge and of course there is a certain tradition of english whingy singers and i do not like the lyrics  this can be put down to a matter of taste but they are always too selfconsciously clever too selfconsciously weird too selfconsciously arty a series of clever lines that do not add up to a song but a posture so what did i like about them they come up with some superb melodies which they then attack with electronic noise listen to the first track although not one of their strongest melodies there is something there that is hummable but then over a fairly straight forward rhythm the electric guitars thunder into it assaulting the likeability of the song this happens time after time and creates a real tension in the music a sense of promise that is constantly frustrated but then i got further doubts like a lot of ambitious rock the result is a certain bombast and they are not above clich listen to exit music the moment when the drums come in and the song seems to go up a gear that is just corny and the backing vocals which become a choir going aaaahhhh  this is like pouring syrup over the melody underneath the electronic aggression they are a very sentimental band it is all a bit easy there is a certain lack of real imagination listening to the album is like sitting next to a drunk in a bar one moment he is aggressively belligerent the next he is maudlinly sentimental at first there may be a certain excitement in this the threat of the unexpected of a danger but it quickly becomes a routine a bit obvious a bit dull which leaves the question did rock run its course about 35 years ago did it run out of musical ideas since then just revisiting the same territory time after time,2.50,2310
hey this album needs another review right well nonot really but none of these hundreds of reviews and thousands of ratings really mean anything at all anymore so why do not i fling some monkeypoo at the wall anyway upon it is release i bought it  i liked the first two albums felt there was a progression happening something intelligent going on i was deeply impressed for awhile by it is sheer proggyness it is attempted reach into some spooked out atmosphere referencing some of lennons darker white album material and sprinkling a postpixies dust over top of it but that was 1997 and it did not take long for every pseudohipster to tag this album as some kind of important landmark in music and this was one of those times that kind of bandwagon jumping left a nasty singe in my brain radiohead were actually forced into commercial suicide from the wake of this albums reputation but  whatevermy own personal endresult of this whole scene the album created was to pretty much shelve it for the next decade whenever i did pull it out the only track i would really ever play was fitter happier  which probably says something about me that i am not particularly proud of last night i pulled this off the shelf and played it from start to finish with a large whiskey sour and my rapt attention listening to this cycle of songs that are filled with fear and dread i started to feel uncomfortable doomed even there is no comfort in this album it is the continuous sound of things falling apart the world falling out from under your feet it is not pleasant but it is so achingly beautiful in places i cannot deny that yorkes vocals feel like depression incarnate like an ill animal trapped in a room festering with cockroaches the music and it is production try to piggyback onto this vibe and mostly succeeds but then there is that last track which does not fall into the mood of the other eleven it is making a somewhat vain attempt to end on some kind of twisted hopeful air it fails completely but has some brilliant harmonic structures and phrases the whole of the listen left me with a feeling of unlucky prophecy and really that is uncool this will have to stay back on the shelf until i hit some moment in life where it is appropriate to listen again on a side note the only other album that gives me this vibe is pink floyds animals  which like this stays on the shelf mostly despite a healthy respect for it is content and is something i can only listen to when it is the right emotional moment,4.00,2500
even a million flies do not make chocolate out of shit there were definitely too many jokers in the brains,0.50,106
is that me or all todays rock singers sound the same  radiohead u2 pulp  they could have swapped their lead singer without altering their style a bit  same whining postpubescent voices even if the singer is 40  i am doing the effort to listen to some rym  contemporary rock classics but when one comes from the world of soul music and real trained singers they sound really unfinished  or in need of a cover by paul anka   as for the music formless ramblings they could have play this on double triple quadruples albums  as it has no beginning and no end,0.50,554
very overated i just do not understand why this album is rated so highlywhere are the tunes  try whistling these so called songsha ,1.00,131
this album is an arty album it must hence be said that as such you must have the patience to fall in love with it or hate it but you must give yourself the time to make up your own opinion and do not let yourself be influenced by the high position it gets from this website although i personally believe that you could be a lot worse off this album is great its sound is so ahead of any time that it represents a futuristic world that it does not like and that explains the title or perhaps could be taken as a representation the songs are often invaded by digital and technoligic sounds that blow us away and initially even annoy us but we go on to love them as they progress in the song an example of this is found in let down with the synth that sonds like old video game sounds harpeggios so surreal yet so fitting in the overwhelming sound that can be found throughout the album indeed from the first track to the last it is perhaps the way the sound is so full and so overwhelming that on first listen we are fascinated by it but on second listen we feel completely oblivious and begin to strangly support the thesis that this album is overrated it is possible to think so during and after the second listen but it is important when exposed to this album to give it another shot because it is only after the thrid listen that we appreciate this album as a music album the paradox is that the album lives thinks and breathes to be a nonmusic album the antipoprock album almost stripped of any sing along choruses or hum along riffs whenever you expect radiohead to play one chord they play an unlikely one instead and leave the pop version of their music to muse the poppy version of radiohead on a musical point of view this is very admirable and avant garde something that probably has not even been fully appreciated yet but is surely starting to be aknowledged this is not an album to please the crown this is an album to find one and haunt it forever the meanings of the lyrics have something that sounds like a paranoid futuristic or if you will subterranean homesic version of morrissey diluting haunting one liners like the iconic and representative kicking squealing gucci little piggy in paranoid android or for a minute there i lost myself that are lines that do not follow a narrative pattern but are deeply rooted in the unsafety of the human mind and species and has been so since the beginning of time the most chart friendly track and the one to be loved from the beginning is karma police but not for that reason is it the best album then there is no surprpises everything else needs to be appreciated,5.00,2623
1st listen very enjoyable 2nd listen ehh not much lasting power 3rd listen what the hell was i talking about 4th listen this is a masterpiece thom yorke is at his absolute best vocally sounding like an angel or a great beinggod at times his voice can be so chilling soothing but at the same time frantic and worried this is perhaps shown best by my favorite song on the album exit music for a film at one point this is a beautiful love song about escaping and at the same time is a frantic plead for somebody to help thom run away the song is so basic but once the climax hitsi cannot describe it at all so filling so emotional so loving god it is beautiful especially once he starts yelling we are one in everlasting peace amazing line what is truly so amazing about this album is that my favorite song on the album constantly changes one month i am like man airbag is a classic the next month i will be saying yea sure its a classic but lucky is even better kind of hard to describe what i mean by that but i love it because i look forward to every song on this album climbing up the walls and fitter happier are usually at the root of complaints for most people well actually most people do not have any complaints about this album but thing is they fit in so well with the album it works no matter if its a favorite or not plus they really show off their more experimental side on those songs and i am really glad they did because it adds even more variety to this already flawless album so pretty much its obvious by now that this is one of the greatest albums i have ever heard from the beginning unforgettable riff of airbag to the last little innocent perfect bell chime at the end of the tourist there is nothing wrong this album literally saved me musically two years ago when a substitute teacher recommended it to me best teacher ever it really was the first album in any genre that i truly cared about and that made me think really if it was not for this masterpiece i would still be listening to mainstream rap thank you thom thank you airbag paranoid android exit music for a film let down the tourist edit this deserves 2 overall it really does,5.00,2160
it goes without ever having to say again that radiohead and especially this album ok computer are often regarded as the greatest thing to close out the 90s alternative rock fuss for some reason this bands sound has never thrilled me the way i always felt like it should have every critic that has ever been privileged enough to have their pieces printed on paper have proclaimed ok computer along with nevermind mind you as the greatest record to be let loose on the rock world additionally do not forget to bear in mind the tremendous following this group has accumulated since the release of this widely hailed album i am not saying this to diminish radioheads talent and ambition by any means but i can honestly say that i have never been able to park myself in one position and listen to this socalled magnum opus without ever feeling the need to take a quick snooze,3.00,870
thom yorke a wonderful voice wasted on boring music,2.00,51
so here it is the great one where should i begin dissapointment annoyance unlistenable pop genius yes that all applies i suppose but it could just be the genre in that case maybe radiohead is a good band but no i should not make excuses i just cannot listen to them no matter how hard i try no matter how many times i listen to them no matter how many i tell myself to put off this review because it is a great album i always come out empty combine this with a bad experience that was capped off with two of dumbest literally people i have met losing themselves in the art that is exit music for a film and i am left with left a sour taste that even warheads cannot create even karma police the golden gem that anchors it all has almost become a cliche i like the song but only as a change pace tune on a mix cd put side to side with other radiohead songs and you lose all appreciation for it it is odd but every radiohead song that i like still annoys me and it is that annoyance that prevents me from becoming a radioheadhead,2.50,1027
i really tried to like this but tell me what the hell makes this a classic to my humble taste it is so horribly boring and uninteresting there is nothing in it no passion no love no energy,1.00,188
i would long avoided listening to this album probably due to my own skepticism on how ridiculously highly rated and lauded this album and band is i would heard karma police before which was pleasant enough and now finally i come to reviewing ok computer which in all honesty did not place me in the other dimensions most other raters seem to experience upon listening to this the most obvious feature of ok computer and radiohead in general i suppose is the whineydrawlmoan of thom yorke which does very little for me it fits the haunting atmospheric nature of the music sure but to me it comes across somewhat grating then we come to the consistency of the album which measured on it is own is excellent and keeps the listener well within the melancholic whimsy of each consecutive track there are a few good tracks and most of the others are aboveaverage britindiepop fare i will definitely give this a few more listens but it is hard to believe that i will be moved any closer to the gushingradioheadlove camp as for it being rated one of the best albums of all time this is hardly a masterpiece and at best seems a consistent effort from a very highly acclaimed group,3.00,1171
i have tried to explain why i think this is a perfect album but every time i do i end up waffling and let us face it you have probably heard it all before with that in mind ladies and gentlemen i bring you the top ten moments on ok computer 10 the tourist  515 what better place to start than the last sound heard on the album it is that humble ping 9 no surprises  the intro glockenspiely loveliness 8 subterranean homesick alien  259 things all get a bit much for thom but he chills and resolves that he will be alright 7 paranoid android  535 god loves his children yeah cue jonnys freakout really though you could make a top ten moments in paranoid android list 6 karma police  315 ed obrien is responsible for this cool noise apparently who would have thought totally makes that awesome final section 5 lucky  111 is this jonnys most spinetingling guitar line to date i think it may just be 4 airbag  the intro that guitarcomecello makes me want to swoon but that drum loop urges me to dance quite unlike anything else on the album 3 climbing up the walls  357 where yorkes demonic wail and the sinister rising strings create a dissonant harmony all of their own 2 exit music for a film  248 selways bass drum makes its grand entrance and is swiftly joined by the fuzziest of bass guitars what follows is one of the most intense crescendos i have ever heard 1 let down  341 few moments make the hair on my neck stand on edge like this one does an astounding climax containing hope by the bucketload best song on the album for what it is worth,5.00,1547
bloody hell  over 5000 people have given this a five star rating o i listened to ok computer the whole way through and can i remember anything about it i was not on any substances i had no distractions it just disappeared into the ether somewhere,2.50,246
read with caution note the date despite the drastic change in my listening habits during the past couple of years i do not think i will ever come to genuinely dislike this album the nostalgia is just too strong if i have listened to an album in unusually excessive amounts i tend to associate that album with phases of mine such as the phase when i was obsessed with a certain deceased online game called wormhole familiar music carries strong visual and memorial connections and can eventually come to symbolize something i heavily associate with it this album ok computer carries the most memories and symbolizes the most things of any album i have ever listened to just hearing thoms voice lilt on exit music immediately summons up the darker heartwrenching scenes of fire emblem fe7 in japan the tourist recalls the daily trips to and from dads office building back in michigan i do not use quotation marks because these songs are so familiar and so vital to the memories of my early adolescence and quote marks have a certain alienating oh the irony effect to them i will never forget the first time i heard the album i was around 12 i think and my sister was driving me around with her on errands wanting to infect me a veritable preteen pleb who thought all star was the greatest song ever with some more sophisticated music she had recently discovered a feat which she was ultimately more successful at i think than even she knows she played this for me i regarded it amicably and with curiosity i rather liked the first two songs loved the third one especially for its cosmic guitar tone did not know what to think of the dark fourth one and generally liked the rest of the songs i heard marveling of course at that weird seventh one she said the band which had recently replaced the atarees as her favorite band was called radiohead that fact stayed in the back of my mind for the next couple of weeks after that time that fact came out of hibernation and my curiosity sparked i listened to the album again and it was pretty much instant love the swooping guitars of airbag the general epicness of paranoid android the jagged terror of climbing up the walls the singular albumcloser feel of the tourist i bathed in the rapture and loved every second of it authentic aural ecstasy ensued in this manner for many months to come i committed lyrics to rote memory i hummed riffs and melodies during meals and i constantly revised my opinions of the best tracks nearly every track got a turn at best song even fitter happier it was the most anyone could ever expect from music while i got into some other alternative stuff like the flaming lips and belle  sebastian ok computer remained my one true love of course though all good things come to an end i eventually set the album aside in favor of some fresher tunes which i had not worn down to the bone and i explored the rest of radioheads material then i moved from michigan back to new york an introspective and reserved kind of guy i did not make any real friends during the semester before the summer during that summer i rejoined a radiohead forum i had previously only casually browsed my interest in music piqued i started downloading everything in sight and here i am now if i listened to this album for the first time today i would probably think it a pretty good album but quite undeserving of the heaps of praise and pure hatred thrown upon it ok computer occupies a singular place in the canon these days it is probably the gateway album the oneman transition from classic hard rock to indie and alternative music and culture in general ok computer is coming to be an essential white adolescent experience of vaunted proportions if you have not heard this record whether you love it or despise it you do not know anything about indie culture my once pure view of this unique album is now tainted by the context of a broader knowledge of music and societal trends and while i always enjoy listening to it now it is simply that record the one that measures musical navet i truly wish this were not the case but knowledge corrupts i still retain memories of those innocent times though and visual and mental cues of that phase pop up all the time my experiences with ok computer embody those of the complete journey from musical ignorance to avantgarde elitism comically enough i completely skipped over the comptemptible classic rock phase that so many youths go through and too many never leave thanks meghan it was the first album i really connected with and it still occupies a unique place in my collection my love for the album though now not nearly my favorite is in a sense overflowing i could never ask more from any piece of music,5.00,4706
one of the albums that i could listen to but could not understand you know if you are not good you will be bad or ugly it also has a meaning in itself and it has some beauty in part they are the most inflated album in history unnecessary wow erenler you say radiohead three times and the whole world is buying and listening to ok computers to see if we are losing something yes you are losing money in your pocket,0.50,413
ok computer trackbytrack 01 airbag great start airbag is dissonant electric intense the most experimental on the album which can be read as a sample button of the intentions of the group in okc the disk is opened large 55 02 paranoid android i have been listening to it for ten years and unfortunately it does not surprise as it should the first part is excellent following the line of experiments that had been anticipated in airbag the second part destroys the melody with the typical punk side that rh tends to try and that in most cases ruins his songs the third part the funeral is beautiful and returns to the love that had begun with the first part being dismantled again when those guitars returned 45  25  4  25  1454  362 355 by approximation 03 subterranean homesick alien the most progressive side ever shown by rh nothing really revealing 35 04 exit music for a film i hate plaintive music with epic breakdowns like the ending of this one the worst of the lot the album begins to decline 155 05 let down another plaintive one but much more effective and precious also it has superb lyrics his all tomorrows parties 45 06 karma police a good single everything is in its place piano with spectral reminiscences of the beatles brand noisy break without overacting and a thom yorke who knows how to sing his anguished pursuit with an ironic touch listening to it on the radio does not hurt 45 07 fitter happier the idea is good pass the word through a computer recounting the life of any being alienated by work and technology its execution complies 355 08 electioneering it seems that rh does not want to give up the idea that they too can rock it is not their best facet but here they sound surprisingly obfuscated which gives greater strength to a normal song 35 09 climbing up the walls the next three songs could justify their classic status climbing up the walls is a wall of guitars like those played by mogwai at the same time softened in a more pop context which does not make them any less impressive the second top 455 10 no surprises this is indeed a ballad a thom yorke more reciting than singing a xylophone melody acoustic guitar and no alarms and no surprises 55 11 lucky lucky must be the example of a transition song from  to okc it unites in a great way that spirit of the sweetest britpop with the spectral mantra that covers a good part of the album 45 12 the tourist the closing is another approach to progressive rock like subterranean homesick alien its main person in charge is jonny greenwood its slowness cushions the emotional climax of the previous 3 songs but does not leave that anguish that would allow it to return to the album 35  and that was ok computer to the eyes and ears of this server it averages 36 which is roughly three and a half stars i do not deny that it is an important album but ten years later it sounds selfconscious without that cynicism that makes other masterpieces of british adolescence timeless like the queen is dead or different class instead his longsuffering look at the world of 1997 makes him a good testimony of his time the best we can find but this is not enough to make this album a classic or a turning point in pop music,3.50,3199
i do not think the world would ever be the same without ok computer it is been 10 years and a couple months change since parlophone printed it and it is still the quintessential album of our times that is more than a title to bestow upon some preposterously well liked form of entertainment it is an anomaly the bends signaled a bright future but not one that featured ok computer or any album as equally immense quite frankly the album should not exist the record is just too epic it is almost as if the course of history was changed when ok computer dropped just about every album ever released suits the times they are created in this record was so perfect the times suited ok computer i know i am getting all myth maker on your ass but what else can i say this is it the record to end all records in the 20th century and begin all of the records in the 21st century or something like that to some people it was just a couple guys updating pink floyd for the grunge generation i prefer to call those people dumbasses okay pink floyd is indeed a distant relative i will give those dumbasses that but they are still no where near as immediate the bends comes closest and that is not even in the same universe there really is nothing like it prior to or since again an anomaly no other music album i have heard represents so many feelings at the same time fear hope despair destruction alienation open air claustrophobia triumph quietude failure anxiety trepidation uneasiness contentment nonchalance harmony peace distortionnothing can even capture 116th of its majesty ok computer is so isolated from everything else because it was made under isolation jonny greenwood said it best the main difference in the atmosphere from past albums was in the studio experience we were all of the same age mid to latetwenties and doing a record in the middle of nowhere and there were no established professionals there it was not a real recording studio and we had our friend stanley donwood doing the artwork in the studio at the same time we were all at the same stage of our life and all working together for something it was quite a buzz recording an album by yourself is not a new concept but in the right hands it can create something entirely uncontaminated and virginwhich is pretty much what happened with ok computer in case you were just born you may be asking yourself what this record sounds like imagine if the happiest day of your life was the day you killed yourself it is like opening christmas presents during the apocalypse a spaceflight directly into the sun getting the best sleep of your life on top of the button that simultaneously launches all the nukes in the world driving your car into a pit of fire ok computer marries thrill and harrow joy and death ordinary and impossible all that and more to say the album is nothing short of magic would be hitting the nail on the head now you do not have to love this album you do not have to even like it all preceding hyperbole is just how i see it hell it is not even my favorite radiohead album the thing is i believe that at some point in your life you will love ok computer your deathbed 7th grade a walk in the park working at the same desk after 32 years watching your two dogs fuck doing your sons math homework your sisters wedding reception whatever the situation sooner or later this album will get you it is just too powerful to be ignored i mean this is it thom yorke would never write better lyrics than he did here radiohead would never sound more natural than they did here the pressure upon radiohead would never be as assuring as it was frightening as it is here critical consensus on a radiohead record would never be as definite as it is here history probably could not be encapsulated on a record better than it is here be all end all this whole review is nothing new what is there left to say anymore really it is almost as if ok computer just left everyone imaginatively speechless it is been about 123 months since the world changed and the only constant is just how great this record is such a thing should not be possible but if ok computer is possible what is not,5.00,4150
jiminy crickets this album is awesome back in 97 amongst my circle of friends i was first to like this album nobody else got it now of course it is a huge modern classic critically acclaimed whosawitz and they all really enjoy it i get no credit for being the first i guess that is just how it goes it is all perfect thoms vocals are awesome every song is catchy and complex and owning this gives you cred that is three things going for it how many did sgt peppers have going for it again two oh yeah that is right no i am not going to explain this thought any further i like every song on here but i thought i would shout out to some esoteric favorites that most of the other reviewers tend to gloss over fitter happier to me is a lot more than just filler it is creepy and interesting with the most gripping lyrics on the album that line still kisses with saliva always gets me for some reason packs a lot of punch i also really like climbing up the walls that is some mad crescendo it is got in the chorus there sends chills down your spine and uh none of the other tracks are esoteric favorites at all but i will say that no surprises is one of the most beautiful songs i have ever heard possibly overhyped but it is still one of the greatest albums of the 90s,5.00,1264
radiohead is either loved or hated many consider them the lifesaver of 90s english music many consider them a boring and pretentious band what i think i think it is a fantastic band from the melancholy and sad beginning of the first record to this great record the band has always remained restless and full of ideas a great band that always deserves to be heard it is good that they make a sound like this in full 9000 01 airbag the weather is claustrophobic by the way this is synonymous with radiohead but at the same time the melody takes you by the heels and makes you keep your ears open a lineup somewhat obscures phil selways drums and colin greenwoods simple and perfect bass line rule the song although the bands two guitars ed obrien and johnny greenwood always build disconcerting lines not to mention the melodic lines of thom yorke who has one of the coolest vocals of the entire 90s it is emotion on the tip of the tongue 02 paranoid android wow if this is not the most claustrophobic insane and chesttightening song ever written it is nothing from beginning to end the feeling is almost indescribable a weird guitar line vocals breaks everywhere  the guitars are always very sharp and full of pain before the biggest craze and i weigh a very good bass line excellent so here comes a beautiful byzantine choir laughs speaking of the fact that it refers to the church but i am not sure if it really is 03 subterranean homesick alien of an absurd subtlety the name directly reminds me of bob dylans subterraneam homesick blues but what we hear here is a breathtaking melody the ones we hardly forget so soon memorable 04 exit music for a film melancholy no this is beyond melancholy if you have suicidal tendencies go away laughs it is one of those that if you are not careful it washes you down too only voice and guitar and keyboards beyond macabre 05 let down strange combination after a track beyond down what you hear on let down the name fits is an almost happy song what would an almost happy song be like well an almost joyful song is the one that almost makes you happy wow what question leaving the jokes aside what we have here are guitars in lines that strangely match each other and a wellbuilt base and it is always great to hear colins bass lines very well built into the bands music clever ending full of noises and melody 06 karma police this is the ultimate in anguish in musical form starting with the initial piano going through thoms vocals that always emanate some kind of true suffering from those who really feel what they are singing they are not just words in a melody  for the first time a keyboard really appears and it does not look bad it builds a divine melody in an apocalyptic mood we finished 07 fitter happier this is the height of experimentalism have you ever seen those computer programs for blind people where every single thing you write is repeated by a robotic voice so that is what it is about in the background only noise experience listen and doubt 08 electionnering rock and roll noise this is the beginning a more common melody which is not very common on the record what badass vocalizations in the background of the song guitars everywhere 09 climbing up the walls the feeling of climbing the walls here is more than abstract with almost electronic percussion and poorly treated vocals it is only halfway through that music becomes more human but as the keynote of the record is computerization this is a luxury laughs 10 no suprises my god what a beautiful thing from the beginning of the little guitar imitating a music box the melody full of lyricism and memories it is a challenge to listen to without being deeply moved yorkes vocals are emotional until you cannot help it anymore sensational good for the senses 11 lucky bass front bass guitar accompanies with sensitive fingerings and is not it that the guys are good with the chorus always striking choruses with melodies beyond good a rare thing in bands that are more experimental there are even some jazzy bits towards the end 12 the tourist many may find it monotonous i agree that there are certain moments to listen to the sound of the guys this is not for everyone i can say,4.50,4201
i really do not know why people adore thisok there are lots of fans of this bandtherefore radiohead cannot be a bad bandnot a really good one for me thoughok the instrumental stuff is goodfor someit is too sleepy for me but what makes this band average is their vocali cannot stand his annoying voiceits makes the whole album insensiblelazysleepythis band is overrated for mei would give it less than 25 if there were not a lot of fans of this band,2.50,448
ok computer is an album of immense grandeur now that i have lost half my audience with an unbearably pretentious statement let me explain it to the half that stayed to hear me out ok computer is almost too awesome for it is own good trying to comprehend all of it in one listen is like trying to read the bible in a day it is a many layered masterpeice that continues to impress and enlighten me with every new listen it never let us up throughout the 53 and a half minutes as i listen to this album for what must be the 50th time in my short life i am still learning new things furthermore i believe if i listened to it another 50 times i would still have more to learn i know it is been said innumerable times by many people but this is an essential component of anyones collection and i say that without any trace of hyperbole you must own ok computer,5.00,854
i hate to throw around the overrated tag but this album is definitely a contender for the dubious title of most overrated album of all time frankly it is mostly forgettable and unremarkable occasional moments of genuine musical creativity shine through but as i said they are occasional there is a fine line between being really artistically creative and sticking a fork up your arse twisting ten times and claiming it is artsy and radiohead are familiar with crossing that line also thom yorkes vocals are as dreadful as three cats being strangled this is especially true for the slower songs which he completely massacres now i will not lie electioneering is a good song and karma police and paranoid android both have a few things going for them the rest should be consigned to the rubbish bin of history it seems some pseudoelitists act all superiorist about radiohead and praise ok computer like it is the first and second comings of jesus combined it is hilarious really especially given all the amazing music out there that would be more deserving of such overly effusive praise ah well what can you do,1.50,1109
it is the most overrated album ever i noticed some interesting ideas a few nice melodies but these guys cannot play or sing the guitarists are not even professionals i never understood and probably never will understand why this band and this record is interesting for so many people i have tried to listen to the tracks  more than once and it just does not sound good it is simply boring and not even original,2.00,410
straight rock fans hate this this is rock for folks who do not love rock rock with brains  more than three chords with sad and pessimistic lyrics which i never pay attention to with uplifting effects with abundant space to evoke visions with luxurious details and amazing sonic spheres  from a mere quartet almost without electronics almost without speed without predictability introvert difficult relevant earopening monstrous smashing the rock album from the nineties to be played loud,4.00,487
shit album wished my girl did not like that crap so much one of the bands not allowed to be played home when i am around this guy should be gagged once and for all,1.00,163
i do not know maby it is me but this album did nothing for me maby i didnt have my headphones on tight enough it seems to lack power and drive so i guess if any music lover out there wishes to explore this band just beware there is a lack of umph you will not be snaping to a beat sence there really isnt one i found it a bitover rated but hey i also dislike opera,2.00,364
without a doubt high on the list of albums that any serious musiclover needs in their collection almost from start to finish it is filled with beautiful emotional songs with gorgeous arrangements the production is spot on that is you do not even notice it  you just hear the song opener airbag is just one of the most perfect first tracks you could hope to hear it is not the best on the album but why would you want that surely a greater pleasure is to hear something damn good then hear something infinitely better afterwards the mixing of the tracks on ok computer is sublime it holds together beautifully as an album and takes you on a journey filled with enigma airbag itself is but the first song on the journey it is a song about a car crash which the singer survives and is basically beautiful in a harsh way the albums undoubted highlight is paranoid android it is a bohemian rhapsody for the nineties with four parts each seguing into the other perfectly the acoustic part one sets a tired soul against the bustle of the world please could you stop the noise i am trying to get some restfrom all the unborn chicken voices in my head part two introduces the best riff on the decade yes better than teen spirit it is menacing and thrilling and after one listen creates an incredible surge of anticipation to hear it played loud and with of briens jerky spastic touch after the line you do not remember you do not remember listened to loud especially with headphones i have to say this is possibly the greatest moment of music of the decade britpop pah thom yorke deserves far more credit as a singer than he gets listen to his delivery of off with his head man ohhhh part three is subdued almost operatic rain down raaaiiin down from a great height is the lyric to which yorke applies his strained nasal tones the lyrical punch to the song is delivered in the least abstract of the verses in that is it sir you are leavingthe crackle of pigskinthe dust and the screamingthe yuppies networkingthe panic the vomitthe panic the vomitgod loves his childrengod loves his children yeahhh and then here comes that riff again the musicianship of the band is underrated rarely has a group of musicians played music together and produced so incredible an effect and certainly not since the guitar solos at this final juncture of the song soundtrack perhaps the apocalypse the album is honestly worth buying just for this single song alone listen to it loud with headphones or whilst driving at night and prepare to encounter a musical dimension you have hitherto left undiscovered imagine pink floyd but a hell of a lot more aggressive and moving naturally after the hysteria of paranoid android subterranean homesick alien is in all honesty a dissapointment it takes a few moments to realise that this too is a great song one about abduction spacey noises and another fine vocal performance lend this an otherworldly feel exit music is far too sad to listen to in a sane state of mind nevertheless i and we do and it just makes us sad no one has the art of a sad song down to the nack of thom yorke and co the distorted bass towards the end takes it over the top of depression and the song lurches headfirst into megalomaniac insanity let down is one of the best songs on the album and that is really saying something it is gentler and less directlyaffecting than the other songs and features a melancholy trot of a beat and again some gorgeous vocals the lyrics are about city life perhaps the bustle of a metropolis the unnaturalness that took some spelling after a good few lagers of mans mechanical dominion this theme pervades through the album  or at least the mechanical unnatural aspect of human civilisation and it is depressing grayness like i say i am wui writing under the influence fool perhaps the best state to be in when typing about such an amazing record i am probably miles off luckily radiohead lyrics are open to interpretation for the most part karma police is great but overplayed  at least by buskers in my local city if you have never heard it enjoy the magic for the first time then enjoy one of the albums two lowpoints yay fitter happier is alright i guess but a two minute song of stephen hawking vocals listing off various middleclass life occupations like trainspotting did anyone else find ewan macgregors narration of stuff like widescreen televisions etc a bit of a deflation after the glory of lowlife depravation is not going to cut it on an album of otherwise genius quality luckily things are brought back to life with electioneering the fury of paranoid android is resurrected sadly though without the zap it is still a good track though and gives thom a chance to vent his anger at plastic twofaced politicians climbing up the walls is creepy in song form let me say no more than that no surprises gets a little boring but the firsttime charm of the glockenspiel never gets tooold the lyrics are nice too now had lucky been the finale of ok computer it might have been the greatest album ever made it is beautiful and epic and after thom sings we are standing on the edge you assume that is it record over and god what a record but unless you have been watching the tracklisting on the back of the cd case or following the lyrics booklet it is a terrible surprise and shame to have to listen to the tourist after the perfect end to the perfect radiohead album it is not a terrible song it is just terribly placed it is the second disappointment on ok computer and without it the album would have been a more incredible listen it just does not end so dramatically with this tagged on the end like a lost child as such the album gets four and a half stars out of five it could have been so much better radiohead but you are for now limited to the title of one of the damndest bestest most emotionally draining incredible beautiful listenable powerful eradefining records ever recorded in the history of recording think what could have been,4.50,5976
ok computer gave new meaning to the term hype as soon as it was released every publication hailed it as a masterpiece inevitably the buying public soon followed what is perplexing is that there are not much difference between this and the previous the bends it is the same radiofriendly alternative ballads just more intricately arranged the same passionate stadiumrock overtones the same hypocritical message radiohead former middleclass students and current rock stars criticizing modern society ok computer features two great songs the disjointed airbag and the hysteric prog paranoid android as well as a few interesting moments the psych lounge subterranean homesick alien the melodramatic buzz of let down the semi triphop climbing up the walls on the other hand exit music karma police no surprises lucky with female backing vocals reminiscent of mid 70s floyd and tourist are soap operas dramas for white collar workers blockbusters for thinking people at least half of this album is songs we have heard millions of times before and occasionally too reminiscent of rem radiohead are the alternativerock equivalent of steven spielberg they produce thoughful albums sometimes with faux experimental overtones but when it comes down to it they are sentimental trite ok computer is softrock disguised as artrock it is the dark side of the moon of the 90s,2.50,1358
some say it is the greatest ever and i have tried very hard to like it but it just sounds mostly like twaddle to my cloth ears,1.00,126
this album is alright radiohead is a decent band but i fail to see why they are considered so great ok computer is not even close to being a great album,1.00,152
what other album inspires so many unsubstantiated pointless reviews such as simply the best album of the 90s full stop or induces as many pretentious diatribes equating this album to the very essence of human existence one typically eloquent non rym internet review cites ok computer creates a replication of my whole existence and fools my worries into thinking they are the real thing as they leave me for a faade instead of spending months picking the bones out of the above why not find any number of the countless similar reviews whereby the listener has found exactly what the meaning of life is via this albumthere are literally 1000s to be found by simply typing the words prententious radiohead reviews into google  the funny thing about the reviews is that the writers have often simply ignored what the band has to say about the creative impetus behind the tracks a couple of slides across a mouse mat will find numerous sites whereby direct quotes from the band explain the lyrics for instance airbag is simply about the joy of avoiding a car crash and the resultant adrenaline rush karma police is simply about wishing ill fate on your exboss and the bob dylan rip off subterranean homesick alien is simply about an essay that thom yorke was asked to write at schoolthis is all in the bands words who simply refused to offer any such overt pretentions and makes you wonder whether they have any rib cages left after they have finished their daily laughing spree about some of the meanings that those who are that way inclined impart upon this album perhaps such pretentious meaning of existence interpretations come from the fact that in this album radiohead leave behind the guitar rock dominance of pablo honey and the bends and experiment superbly with everything they can get their hands on weird keyboards multi segmentations computerised samplings electronica and amazing time shifts are all wrapped up in their undoubted technical brilliance as true exponents of their craft they find amazing ways to talk about the normal emotions in life which could and are in the wrong hands be interpreted incorrectly personally i admire the albumbut i admire it for what it actually is not for what it is is not perhaps this is my fault in life to me an airbag is an airbag a tosser of an ex boss is a tosser of an ex boss etc fortunately it appears the band think the same way unfortunately thousands of internet reviewers do not,3.50,2439
this is not a good album competeent yes but not good it is as pretentious as a band formed in oxford are likely to be and the feelings are simply not thereyou soon get bored of the moany almost emo style of the lyrics,2.00,217
i have never thought to myself boy radiohead has great guitar playing or drumming or thee like instrumentally this album appears vastly inferior to so many great innovative albums of thee 90s decade but still there is something like a mystique surrounding thee songs themselves how totally poweful thee lyrics are n how 10 years later karma police still sounds interesting in comparison to whatever else thee radio has played in those 120 months thee huge crash cymbal hits that are predictable may get old thee guitars may sound like nothing special but yorke has written some of thee great alt rock songs ever i have loved this album particularly thee stretch from 25 n i have played it more consistently than almost any altrock album i have ever owned even with thee utterly whack album opener n tracks 7 n 8 thee rests just that enjoyable but i have yet to worship it n do not imagine i ever will there is just so much more to thee 90s,2.00,939
radiohead is really the band i have given the most chances to i have never been able to listen to these guys any album and i came back to them because really i thought i was missing out on something seeing how acclaimed they are all over the world and even here at rym i cannot say i have had any success and this record remains a bland one would you guys rent me a set of ears for a weekend so that i could actually for once understand what you guys can hear that i cannot ok this is not a bad record and it is listenable but what else is there the guys vocal is annoying as hell and the music is blah lyrics may be the only thing that deserves attention but that is it anyway,2.00,677
dear ok computer it is been a while has not it yes too long old friend i feel as though i owe you an apology i have not been good to you these last couple of years remember the good old days heh yeah you were my favourite album back then you were my the queen is dead my nevermind it was you i thought of as i lolloped home from school after a day of speaking as little as possible so that nobody could hear my squeaking breaking voice no girls no alcohol just you what happened old friend oh of course i remember i found loveless well i suppose i would better admit that i am still with her i would not patronise you by saying it is not you it is me if i could help it but that is the truth  it was just time to move on i know what you think of her she is vacuous distant pretentious heh but do not you remember when people thought that about you come on how many sections are there in paranoid android hmm too many for a lot of people except now they have initiated you into the rock canon have not they yeah they say you are up there with the best of them i think we both know you are not that kind of record really not deep down you are no classic rock album oh sure they made you while listening to led zep and the beatles but you are one of us really you know you are you are too passionate  i still think let down is one of the most beautiful songs ever i really do and exit music well i do not need to tell you that it is the saddest piece of music i have ever heard and then there is climbing up the walls of course which really is as terrifying as it was intended to be i thought you were perfect yknow i really did heh i even thought karma police was your best song can you believe that of course you can you were there patting me on the head and saying yes of course it is dear but you know even though i have got more perspective now even though i can see you in a more objective light well i guess what i am trying to say is that i never stopped loving you i know i have grown a lot since i was with you  i listen to all kinds of things i never thought i would like everything from hardcore to ambient music but i owe it to you really you put me on the right path you gave me the road map you sat me down and said now listen son there is a lot of music out there and you have to remember that you cannot apply rules to what is good and what is bad remember this boy it is important you have to go with your gut i think it is a testament to you that i am the listener i am today so thank you ok computer thanks for everything yours with love and gratitude ignorantium,4.50,2580
if you need to say the expression overrated in a funny way you can always pronounce it ok computer edit no surprises and let down are honestly quite good songs this does not change the opinion that ok computer is the worst radiohead album this side of hail to the thief,2.50,269
i think this group is the most overated group of musicians ever sure i love some of the songs here but this is just not an album that i can listen to but once in a blue moon,3.00,173
paranoid android karma police beautiful songs but that is about it the remaining 10 tracks are overall nice but also quite boring the fact is the music sounds like a compromise it is not as britpop as the bends and it is not as electronic as kid a and amnesiac the result is a transition album uncertain about its nature and unwilling to exit its comfort zone definitely not a standout in radioheads discography,3.00,411
this is one of those albums i bought simply on the acclaim factor without really liking the band i mean 55 million people cannot be wrong right just goes to show how individual music taste is i imagine fans of this album also love jeff buckleys grace and are into the flaming lips yoshimi at least 12 will also like coldplay i have tried many times to listen to this record all the way through and i cannot manage it it bugs me that much weird hey,1.00,447
why the hype i freakin hate hype and the hype surrounding this album is totally unjustified got rid of this album in disgust as a resultnowhere near as good as i was expecting perhaps it is because i am not a spotty pretentious ignorant selfabsorbed musically blinkered twiti do not know seems you have to believe the worlds against you and everything you want to love and believe in to really get this droning screachy drivel it would be interesting to find out the average age of moron who own and deify this albumbetween 16  24 i would think and most of them bearing the scars of pubescent uncertainty and angstsays it all apart from a few moments of quality it is mostly shite,2.00,680
this is pathetic as all radiohead albums have showed they are a bunch of talentless arogant hippocrits drivel is the best word to some up this ridiculously overrated album it is truly lame how can anybody call this music no rhythm no meaningful words which you cannot actually hear and no joy pathetic avoid like the plague if you no what real music is about,0.50,358
it is said that this is an album that repays repeated listening it is also frequently said that it is the greatestalbumanywhereintheuniverseforalleternity the first is certainly true  i can attest to that personally having listened to it all day yesterday and this morning for the sake of doing this review i am however not yet convinced as to the latter there are distractions enunciate god damn it why oh why does thom yorke have to be an effing falsetto stop with the goosebumps already and the last is the point really radiohead create something unique with ok computer a sort of passionate alienation that goes to the core of the soul impatience with some aspects of the whole  such as the expression of sentiments and fears that one does not share or the odd indulgent riff  give way to a flood of genuine emotion on listening to the album as a whole consideration of individual tracks is a mistake although the album does not get top marks as even within the whole and despite admiring the lyrics i cannot bring myself to like the raucousness of electioneering but otherwise an exceptional piece of work,4.50,1110
crap seriously total crap if this is the best that mainstream music has to offer i want no part of it i would rather listen to whale sounds on one of those get to sleep faster cds this album is so boring that i want to gouge out my eyes with a spoon while listening to it,0.50,271
this kind of music is so depressing that if you want to live happy life do not listen to this,0.50,93
if this is a classic album what are crap ones like  i bought this silly me based mainly on reviews i had read ok i only paid 599 for it but that is still 599 too much will someone explain to me why this is so highly rated because it sounds like a very boring runofthemill album i played it 3 times and got so utterly bored with it i just binned it so i would not be tempted to give it another try if you are curious and are thinking about buying this cd do not it is crap fact,1.00,476
despite all of the masturbatory praise bestowed on it by seemingly every living member of the british rock press  i really do not get this album the tedious meandering arrangements yorkes reedy whine the selfsatisfied gloomy progginess of the whole thing honestly it is the auditory equivalent of a rainsoaked weekend,3.00,317
is not this the album the us government used to smoke out manuel noriega trying to get through the entire thing was pure torture radiohead is creative alrightcreatively bad that is dull and listless drivel undoubtedly this album is still used today to torment political dissidents all over the world i stole the last line from a colleague of mine and i feel really bad about that  but not bad enough not to use it,1.00,413
it is good but a masterpiece is a little much nothing more than a good album would not recommend it,3.00,99
this album is evil it is responsible for the whining whinging responsibility shirking culture that has pervaded western youth for the last 10 years radiohead are not pointed sensitive critics of the postmodern military industrial complex or the alienation caused by modern technology they are pampered mummys boys from the mean ghetto streets of oxfordshire who realised early that some girls dig it when boys look moody and have based their career and music on that fact it boils down to a simple equation musicsoulpretensionradiohead having said this i like their basslines no complaint at all about the bass player the purpose of the glorious genre we call rock music is not to articulate selfindulgent misery or indeed to save the whale radiohead attempt to do both without even thinking up a tune the idea if you are writing songs from the dark side is to articulate pain genuine sincere pain or if you are writing about politics blinding angerthis cannot be done when you are concerned about karma police infecting your brain still less when your imagery is so elliptical you could be singing about literally nothing it was once said of paul simon that if some girl had not have treated him so bad in high school we would have missed out on all those marvelous songs thom oh how i hate that darn h seems to have had the same experience reading a un report on wealth redistribution by all means listen to the first two albums the second especially  but do not buy into this nonsense you will never get out,0.50,1510
overindulgent pretentious wallowing pink floydesque crap disappointing because the bends was so good lucky is excepeted from above criticism,2.00,140
this album is definitely overanalyzed so it would be reasonable not to write too much about it although i prefer the evolution in their two latest albums it is beyond dispute songs like paranoid android karma police climbing up the walls no surprises are incredible art work however i personally believe the strongest point of this album is exit music for a film i did not really see all the beauty feel all the happiness and optimism of this song until i saw the band play it live at belfort festival just look at thom at the end of the song the moment he sings and you can laugh a spineless laugh we hope your rules and wisdom choke you and now we are one in everlasting peace you can feel all those feelings breaking out burning in thoms voice and manifesting on his face this is just enough to make me fall in love with it,5.00,826
ok computer is the album is simply perfect an incredible mood that put you floating in space a lot of gorgeous moments and outstanding songs like paranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police climbing up the walls no surprises and lucky hard to find another better perhaps radioheads the bends,5.00,305
not a masterpiece that is a word that gets thrown around by people who do not listen to enough music the word masterpiece should only apply to things that are flawless ok computer is not with only four good songs out of twelve it is easy to make a case for this being the most blown out of proportion album of all time get over it with a little searching you can find much better music to obssess about that is actually original,3.00,428
the singer has an interesting voice and paranoid android is a pretty good song  other than that they are boring and you could never party listening to them  this is music for antisocial behavior just as the band exudes  the biggest reason for reviewing this album is all you radiohead fans bash all the really good music from the 70s  if ya like radiohead it should be a key to stay away from music that rocks ,2.50,410
holy shit if you do not own it buy it it is absolutely brilliant my favorite album ever this cd is best listened to at midnight wheadphones and the volume cranked way up,5.00,169
ok computer delves into the deepest darkest moods imaginable it creates an atmosphere of shadows paranoia melancholy and remarkable joy somehow simultaneously dark and uplifting a majestic panoramic and overwhelming powerful landscape of intricately textured layered instrumentation surrounds the moody sardonic and beautiful voice of thom yorke the perfect mix of poprock and electronica a concept album about the perils of technology ok computer experiments with concepts concerning everything from neardeath experiences to alien abduction this album really shines on tracks from the opener airbag to the closing epic the tourist an album such as this will never be duplicated or eclipsed not even by radiohead themselves this album is better left unchallenged released only five years ago in 1997 it has already made its mark in music history as possibly the greatest rock album of the modern pop era an absolute masterpiece radiohead is considered by critics as well as a worldwide cult of rabid fans to be one of the greatest bands in the history of rock however this album only defines one period in radioheads multifaceted history,5.00,1137
i looked in a dictionary to look up the definition of overrated it said to overestimate the merits of rate too highly i did not like that definition so i printed out the album art from this album and pasted it over the definition at least i have something good to look at now instead of those crappy pictures they have in the dictionary okay its not that bad airbag karma police and electioneering are highlights here but the album for the most part seems very topheavy starting off really strong and just goes downhill after fitter happier is this a decent album absolutely is this the goto album in terms of art rock and arguably music overall absolutely not that would come with their next release,2.00,700
beggars my brain how this album can possibly be voted the best album of all time apart from one or two interesting moments paranoid android specifically  even if it is a bowie ripoff this is dull insipid lifeless dirge typical modern droning vocals over a backdrop of art student instrumentation that tries to be very clever but comes off as hopelessly contrived this has got to be one of the most overrated bands of all time but then why am i surprised i look at the charts and see acts like take that lily allen and tinie tempah as icons radiohead come from the same mtv generation that spawned those acts  and therein lys the problem  the people who voted for this are obviously too young and cultureless to know about what is gone before anyone under the age of at least 40 simply should not be allowed to vote on music unless they have educated and immersed themselves in the abundance of riches from years gone by  not just the beatles compare this album to something like bowies the man who sold the world where much of this was stolen from anyway and the gulf in class is so wide its laughable no wonder the western worlds going down the pan,1.50,1149
yo abbey road revolver abbey road again i am really happy for you and i am about to let you finish but rym says ok computer is the best album of all time of all time edit alright semiserious review time there are many legitimate arguments that could be made for this not being the 1 album of all time it was not as culturally influential as sgt peppers it did not spawn an entire genre like itcotck it did not push the musical envelope like velvet underground  niko and did not push the lyrical envelope like highway 61 revisited what it did do however was combine influences from all these albums and more to make one of the most complete sounding albums ever created what i mean by that is that each song works incredibly well both on its own and in context each song instantly drags you into its own confusing schizophrenic sometimes melancholy and mournful world and never let us go yet when it is all over you can look back at the whole album and easily see where all the pieces fit so to speak so no radiohead are not even close to being the most innovative rock group of all time but i will argue that they are simply one of the best ok computer is the culmination of everything they had ever been working toward and it has affected me and many other gen xgen yers so profoundly that it is really no surprise that it is 1 i do not think it is flawless though i would make 2 changes to this album if i could i would make fitter happier the first track i always though it was obviously an intro piece and replace electioneering with polyethylene from the airbag ep really minor gripes though,5.00,1596
this album would be the 3 best album of all time you must be either kidding or stone deaf let me be clear i do not hate this music just because it is popular no i hate it because it is a bleak monotonous depressive boring cold dull and atonal pile of cacophony the extremely annoyingly out of tune vocals and dissonant random guitar solos sound like a worst of xfactor compilation and the generic song structures and musicianship are plain insulting to my ears and do not even dare tag this as progressive this must be the new emperors new clothes story wtf is wrong with you all,0.50,579
another album praised by illiterate hipsters who follow rolling stone magazine and pitchfork as if they are the word of god pretentious overtly banal and completely derivative of electronic sounds ok computer is a soulless enterprise that lingers off of false sincerity this album does not mark the end of the album and the beginning of mp3age as so many critics argue it is just marks another point where rock criticism deviates from professionalism and into some mass marketing campaign sorry folks this is far from being considered a masterpiece 25,2.00,551
radiohead are possibly the most inexplicably overrated music acts of all time and this one of the most ludicrously overhyped pieces of drearyturgid cack since i do not know when the fact it regularly tops greatest ever album polls is proof positive that the world has gone mad whiny introspecive shit that is not as clever or as original as the blinded fools who rate this so highly think an absolute turd,0.50,405
wow i just got back to listening to the entire thing and now i feel suicidalwell anyway on with the review well ok lest start with the vocalssounds like bob dylan getting raped by a whalewhich explains all the ocean noisesok now let us seeohh ya the guitar well there is no chord progression what so ever just playing that weird ass ocean noise over and again ooh ya and the solos are not solos there the the same fret being played at 200 bpms and well bass ooh ya they fired that guy for the whale mating call guy and the drums as boring and repetitive as everything else so it makes me question why is this called art rock when all i see is a steaming pile of shit at best this is a huge fail of a dark side of the moon tribute album in other words this is just about the same level of someone pooping in your ear as you watch your puppy die now if you excuse me i am going to go castrate myself to offset my mind from being ear raped,0.50,936
maybe too obvious but exit music for a film contains a deliberate reference to the beatles back in the youssr the airbag drum track was intended to copy dj shadows endtroducing track 3 on that album esp the great thing about subteranean homesick alien is that it sounds very similar to their bends bsides which might be radiohead at their most original compare climbing up the walls with trickys pumpkin or hells around the corner fitter happier is totally original it is a riskier track than anything done by the pixies smiths u2 or rem or any other radiohead famous influence you could still find comparisons to the beatles revolution 9just a more focused meaningful version johnny greenwood only ripsoff obscure stuff see penderecki messiaen lansky and other 20th c composers so i do not know what the tourist is referencing another track like the trickster and talk show host that i think find radiohead at their most original if they ever made an album like that though the chance for this is probably long past i dare say it might make an even greater album than ok computer they never even released big boots and the we are all grown up now version of big ideas they did release is not the one they might have in 1999 that is my most scathing review of okc ever,4.50,1268
ok overhyped ok groupthink ok mass hallucination ok emperors new clothes look i appreciate music of any style i want to like radiohead i want to like everything this its not good it is drivel its tolerable at best unbearable at worst the mix is a morass of thick headache inducing midrange unlistenable over long listening periods the vocals are a largely unintelligible screech treading the line between whining and screaming the songs are unergetic and uninspiring its difficult to listen to at times there are passages and songs that you want to skip basically its like any other postthe bends radiohead album none of these aspects define good music of any style where are the memorable meloides hooks resonance dynamics the infectious songs that you want to hear on repeat for 2 hours not on this album paranoid android and homesick alien are the only songs that do anything for me the acoustic only version of alien is better radiohead has always struck be as something british which americans say they like to pretend they are hip the idea that this is one of the top 3 albums of all time defies commentary its not even one of the top 3 radiohead albums which is not saying much anyway,1.50,1191
finally a radiohead experience i can actually get behind and why is that it is because they have stopped trying so hard to be a guitar band and instead are shooting for commercial suicide at least capitol thought as much when radiohead delivered the final product to them honestly the music is still pretty firmly grounded in 90s alternative rock it is just that now they are more interested in electric pianos echoy drum kits loops samples crescendoing aka starting a song minimally and then slowly building it up and piecing different sections together to make longer weirder songs the old style is still around on exactly one song the straightup rocker electioneering which usually gets singled out as being the weak link but i like it just fine in fact if any radiohead song could be called underrated it would be this one the other sore thumb is of course fitter happier two minutes of a computerized voice saying stupid shit like on sundays ring road supermarket and car wash and yes this is as pointless as everyone thinks it is nearly every other song though good or bad and they are mostly all good contains at least a few elements that radiohead have not tried before for example if airbag sounds a little weird or off it is because that drum take is not actually being played it is 5 seconds or so of a phil selway sample being looped if climbing up the walls sounds weird too it is probably because the string section handled entirely by jonny greenwood features 16 different violins playing quarter tones apart from each other i cannot say that every decision works to their advantage  the tourist is shooting for a super spacey sound but unfortunately not much happens during its 5 minutes and even though i like the song karma police is one of the more blatant ripoffs of another song i have heard sexy sadie by the beatles on a different note thom is starting to develop that overemoting style of his moaning and drawing out every syllable over two or three bars longer than he needs to and i am basically indifferent here i do not dislike the tone of his voice but his vocals will start to grate on me if the musics boring fortunately the level of writing and arranging was really kicked up a notch on ok computer and i am happy to admit this is almost kind of worthy of the hype,4.50,2296
there is really nothing to be said it is already been said anyone who is a fan of music music history or just human emotion needs an encounter with the masters of each radiohead and ok computer is the place to start nestled in between their old and new sounds of music perfect from start to finish each song is a polished gem i like to listen to the album from start to finish but starting with paranoid android and ending with airbag that why the person described in the album dies with the tourist and is born again with airbag,5.00,529
i was very recalcitrant to listen to this album perhaps because of that habit that human beings have to flee to new aesthetics and overvalue the past and underestimate the present but the truth is that this album blown my head the best album of the last two decades without a doubt,5.00,281
definitely not radioheads most unconventional album but it still leaves an impact mainly one of loneliness tracks no surprises and let down are especially so however in paranoid android and electioneering we see radiohead still knows how to rock,5.00,245
up until a couple of years ago i had only heard two radiohead songscreep and myxomitosis which i did not like i did not understand what the hubbub was about concerning radiohead i found this album for a few bucks at a 2nd hand store and thought i might as well buy it and it completely blew me away a classic album were every song has its value,5.00,344
for me it is the opposite of the bends almost every composition is magnificent sinks into the memory deeply and for a long time,4.50,127
hold on radiohead i would like my sanity back wow,5.00,49
i have always liked radiohead i never really loved them or thought of them has one of the greatest bands ever but i liked what i heard this album is no different its a great record number 3 all time i am not so sure but it is pretty damn good,3.50,242
radioheadok computer radioheads follow up to the bends sees them refining the pop approach for an extremely ambitious wider concept album even if the band disagrees gone are the personal lyrics and pop song structures arriving are the multisectional pieces with a wide variety of instruments piano strings mellotron and more and encompassing lyrics of death alienation and the dullness of everyday life the biggest difference between pablo honey and the bends is the quality of the songwriting but the biggest difference between the bends and ok computer is undoubtedly the scope most important to that scope is the sequencing of the album with airbag and lucky being the first and penultimate tracks respectively both songs tell the story of a man who survived a vehicular accident and provide a sense of the importance of life which all the songs in between focus on in different ways be it overreaction and happygolucky people who do not give enough thought to their action paranoid android alienation subterranean homesick alien or dissatisfaction with a maladroit life no surprises only the albums closer the tourist breaks away from the theme and yorke takes a trip back to the bends and begins talking to himself telling himself to slow down a glimpse of what was to come with kid a paranoid android is a threesection song influenced by happiness is a warm gun and bohemian rhapsody karma police is split into two sections and uses repetition without a chorus fitter happier is a monotonous reading from a computer about a perfect figure which turns out to be a lab animal climbing up the walls is driven by a large string section and bug sounds ok computer is not just one of the most ambitious albums ever it is one of the most needlessly ambitious albums ever the bends was a fantastic album that once again redefined what pop songwriting was capable of arguably the the joshua tree or the queen is dead of its decade in that regard but the band was not satisfied with just a pop album and so they gave us something completely different that maintained the quality of songwriting while the bends utilizes similar styles on each song and relies heavily on distinct riffs melodies and rhythm lines to differentiate songs ok computer relies on different instruments and changes to the key and time signatures only electioneering seems to be unable to find its own identity in radioheads catalog but that only means it is unique to the album and the song is more than good enough to have been on the bends had it been written already aside from the hubble ok computer might have the largest scope of anything we can experience so is ok computer perfect far from it despite the ambition of the lyrics they often fall short in successfully penetrating the listeners hearts the great thing about personal lyrics is that humans for the most part have the same emotions and someone can relate to a piece of art written in that state of mind the bends is far from a lyrical masterpiece but it is extremely easy to relate to social commentary on the other hand has to be articulate and find a way to give its message through a personal issue and if my thoughtdreams could be seenthey would probably put my head in a guillotinebut it is alright ma it is life and life only not everyone in fact not anyone can be bob dylan but for such a scope he should at least be able to give us an i do not want to take what you can givei would rather starve than eat your breadall the things that others want for mecannot buy what i want because it is free yorkes lyrics are occasionally haunting climbing up the wall but more often too abstract to really be effective paranoid android karma police furthermore no song is able to match the best on the bends which in and of itself is not a bad thing because of the strength of its songs but the reason is indeed a problem for the album radiohead was so focused on unique sounds from song to song that they never seemed to have created the best song they could in any style they attempted if they wanted a certain atmosphere to carry through the album they would only truly go for it a couple times and if pablo honey taught us anything it is that radiohead needs practices to master their technique ok computer never gave itself that chance and the subsequent kid a is too busy trying to do its own thing to cash in on all the great things that this still magnificent album gives us for all its flaws ok computer is still a great album and it only seems to get stronger and stronger as you know the songs better the surprise and excitement of hearing a new style the first couple times is eventually overtaken for the desire to understand just why a song is so different and that is when ok computer really shines when you can listen to an album and then not realize how much there is to it until you start to break it down with words you know you have got yourself an album and it is probably better than you thought it was when you heard it why not give it a try spin ok computer write about it and spin it again rating 4255 yeah i went there bsfta let down electioneering,5.00,5109
i give it five stars and it is a great album but even so i say it is a very overrated album seeing that it is in the 3rd position of the best albums in history makes me laugh,5.00,174
when i first heard this album i did not quite get it it is one of many recommendations i took from this site paranoid android clicked quite well and is my favourite song to date the rest of the album did not get me and i kept trying and trying due to advice i took from here i got it after about 34 listens this is beautifully produced and extremely well written music even if the band cannot play very well i love to play the music from this album on guitar and it sounds great and is quite easy for me to play this is a great album and everyone should try at least to listen to it even if you do not get it favourites paranoid android exit music lucky,5.00,653
my second favorite album not their best  and no my favorite album is not the bendsi do not understand why radiohead fans always have to go back and forth with these two i personally think in rainbows is by far their best but like i said many times that is just my personal taste here it is my ratings from least favorite to favorite 12 fitter happier not a songthank you very muchcannot even rate itbut i love what it says no rating 11 climbing up the walls i like the manipulation of the voicebut a bit flat of a song 510 10 electioneering ok song but i could passgood for classic rock and roll lovers 5510 9 lucky we are just lucky to have radioheadgood song 710 8 the tourist i love how it starts very slow then the voice just comes out 810 7 let down reminds me of time after time by quietdriveso i like it 810 6 no surprise love the introbut it gets a little repetitive great song though 8510 5 airbag love the style and use of vocals here8510 4 paranoid android one complainttooooo looong of a songother than that love it much 8510 3 exit music for a film very deep and dark song 248end magnificent 910 2 karma police well as i am sure most people know this song i do not need to make a comment 910 1 subterranean homesick alien the most underrated song by radiohead period i can go on with this song the best one of the album the guitar work it is just magical it takes you to another planetthe soothing vocals and the perfect lyrics together make one of radioheads best songs give this song a try if you do not like it at first 1010,5.00,1540
i have listened to this album so many times i do not even need to look at the song listing for reference 1 airbag 1010 one of the greatest the drumming and bass puts you in a groove that is monumentally different than everything else 2 paranoid android 1010 best song on the album a suite of 3 different parts all featuring amazing harmonies guitar work a greaaaat solo and little details that you notice a new one every time you listen 3 subterranean homesick alien 910 a great one the chorus gets stuck in my head all the time 4 exit music for a film 9510 this song has a great melody and haunting backup vocals brilliant 5 let down 8510 i listened to this once when i was sad i felt yorke was singing to me 6 karma police 1010 for a minute there i lost myself tell me that did not get stuck in your head right then 7 fitter happier 510 could do without it but very cool a good pause and a segway in the middle of the album like treefingers on kid a 8 electioneering 910 great lyrics great riff 9 climbing up the walls 9510 shivers 10 no surprises 1010 lyrics are amazing amazing placement on the album good great brilliant 11 lucky 1010 took me a couple listens to get it but once i got it i got it 12 the tourist 810 closes with a bang 90 overall 3 for message 93 average one of my top 3 albums ever,5.00,1303
the best album that has ever graced my ears monumental in shaping my taste in music,5.00,83
i am by no means a radiohead fan but this cd has the feel of a classic album ok computer just has it that x factor that makes a great album a classic everything i feel in my gut in my head in my heart when i listen to a classic album i feel when i listen to this album it is really incredible this is probably the lamest review i have ever written and i doubt it will make the front page but i am going with my gut here classic albumhas yet to be surpassed by anything that came after it,5.00,487
ok computer is an excellent album but falls short of perfection with me for a couple of reasons the first 8 tracks are radiohead at their best and have me thinking that this is the best album they have ever made but the last 4 are a disappointment for me i am not a fan of climbing up walls while the other three tracks are good but nowhere near the quality of the first 8 airbag is a better version of planet telex from the bends and the themes of the album may seem like nothing new but at the time were unique thoms vocals are good as always and the instrumentation is complex yet accessible overall it is a great album not my favorite by radiohead but still one of the best albums of the 90s favoritesparanoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police no surprises,4.50,775
an indisputable masterpiece to suggest otherwise is laughable and anyone who gives this album a half star rating should say goodbye to their credibility because it is out the window standout tracks no surprises let down karma police and paranoid android,5.00,253
one of the lifechanging albums every note is amazing every song pierces your mind the artwork is stupendous and the amount of emotions put into the whole album is beyond expression everything else i could say about it goes without saying,5.00,237
for sure one of the best albums ever made this has a lot to offer,5.00,65
ok computer is one of those crazy albums where you can listen to the songs in any order and it still retains the greatness of the original track arrangement it would not surprise me if let down is played at the pearly gates,5.00,223
once you surrender your ears to the jangle of greenwoods guitar obrians controlled rhythm greenwoods tamed bass selways multidimensional drums and the chime of yorkes voice you find yourself on a journey through dimensions of melancholic beauty mesmerizing galaxies spin around your head as you sway through the space dust you know your body is secured on the face of the earth however your mind is racing away through colourful atmospheres some radiate bright colours making you feel joyous others dimmer darkly making you ponder on some elements of life such as social disconnection and the importance of empathy sailing through this metamorphosing realm for 53 minutes and 27 seconds i gurantee if you approached this album with clarity in mind you will find a sort sonic nirvana if you will within the immeasurable depths this album scales for what radiohead conceived here is a genuine masterpiece an assorted collection of utter audio delights the spacious spheres of airbag seeps into the multidimensional paranoid android a masterpiece controlling the time shifts majestically while unleashing the tension it had brewed so perfectly before floating back down to sanity this and the successor the peaceful and disconnected subterranean homesick blues only paint a portion of a portrait of the sheer tapestry radiohead crafted exit music for a film delivers yorke at his most vocally haunting while let down is a downright downhearted anecdote only perked up by those tremendously furbished solemn guitar notes karma police is perhaps the most accessible song on the album a fairly straightforward pianodriven art piece which lends a leg of melody to sexy sadie nonetheless it is by all means a perfect art rock song a defining article of the genre poetic and quirky lyrics a definitive melody this song alone has inspired plenty of acts over the past decade fitter happier is the interlude of the whole ok computer scheme the fabricated intelligence of the song failing to deliver emotional drive whatsoever crashing and crumbling down upon itself as we acknowledge the definitive distinction between machine and man is defined via emotion electioneering nods at the bendsera radiohead the tune crashing it is way through political concourse before collapsing at the feet of the eerie and unsettling climbing up the walls perhaps the only song to rival exit music for a film as the most haunting tune on the track it is a twisting tail of paranoia that simply selfdestructs at 307 into a distorted synthetic oblivion and then this bleeds into the absolutely beautiful ok computer trilogy which proceeds with no surprises just a sad downward spiral through ambient notes pampering us softly as we descend down the avenue of pessimistic despair it is one of the most effulgent articles of emotion stirring music recorded the gentle keys capturing melancholy in its finest sonic disguise the equally fantastic lucky was the first radiohead song that really grabbed my attention all those years back and it was also surprisingly one of the first songs the band recorded with nigel godrich who would become their chief producer it is a brilliant melody that slowly builds fulfilling yorkes protagonist with an invaluable abundance of optimism hauling himself out of the wreckage that could be interpreted as a number of things from the obvious physical object to life and sadly we approach the final destination on the musical voyage the sympathetic harmony of the tourist slowly absorbing us into its spiralling sphere encapsulating every last breathe of bittersweet elements the album had to offer constructing a spiral staircase which will guide us gentle out of the album and kiss us with a delicate ping before evaporating into thin air to be honest it is quite hard to describe the album my words alone cannot quite reflect what a dramatic influence this album has had upon the development of me as a person and as a music fanatic hopefully one day these words will come to me a day i can pronounce myself as god perhaps key tracks airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police climbing up the walls no surprises lucky the tourist overall 963636 therefore 55,5.00,4216
one of the best record of our times that is enought right every single piece of music here is really superb and it is not only alternative rock it is a mix and that is make ok computer one of the greateast albums at least in the last 20 years,5.00,242
this is the best album i have ever heard let down makes me cry every single time i hear it as one of my dearest friends so eloquently put it this album sounds like thom yorke has been through the worst human sadness imaginable i have never heard a more earnest display of human emotion i love this album,5.00,303
nobody can turn the soulless suburban existence into an enjoyable listening experience like radiohead can this album is just outstanding one of the best albums ever no ifs ands or buts except for the tourist which was inexplicably included instead of several far better songs that ended up as bsides this is not an album to be passed up and anyone who claims it is too pretentious and intellectual probably cannot count to 3 highlights airbag paranoid android karma police climbing up the walls,5.00,494
ok computer is even better than the bends i did not think that was possible it is absolutely flawless with layered atmospherics and obscure and enigmatic lyrics compliments of thom yorke whose ghostly falsetto fits them like a glove this is not a happy album in fact it is downright depressing but it is a wonderfully crafted release every song has a place on my mp3 player except for maybe fitter happier the specific highlights include paranoid android a great sprawling epic made of many parts electioneering an absolutely furious rant on whoknowswhat thoms vocals are impossible to understand and the terrifying climbing up the walls you cannot understand thom on this one either this would soon become normal on radiohead records airbag is a layered sonically neat track and is the happiest song on the album funny it is about narrowly avoiding a car crash exit music for a film is dramatic and intense and the tourist sounds like pink floyd in their heyday and is a great closer to a great album this is the best album in radioheads catalog it is the best mix of their electronic and guitar driven sounds and is the place to start with the band,5.00,1150
tired of depressing music there is more to life than this there is more to life than this,5.00,89
paranoid android in the first half of the dark track every odd sound that could be imagined comes into play from sambas and maracas to computerized background vocals foreboding lyrics such as ambition makes you look very ugly and when i am king you will be the first against the wall litter the entire track and it inspires thought and provokes startling images not yet found in other music i have heard and then in the middle of this grand majestic devious song the band explodes in a barrage of anger and aggression fast guitar rifts and tumbling drums utterly come out of nowhere and sweep the listener away the song goes on for quite a long time almost 7 minutes in fact but it feels like seconds and you will probably end up listing to it over and over again paranoid android and airbag are not the only two tracks that make ok computer such a fun album to listen to far from it in fact  subterranean homesick alien is a bizarre and very quirky song with echoing guitar rifts and odd keyboard playing that makes this song tend to stand more on the lighter side for the entire cd exit music for a film is a deeply moving slow and acoustic track that finishes off with an electronic guitar that seems to glow with selfcontempt and anger let down is a medium paced and pleasant song that has superb lyrics and ingenious use of keyboards karma police a song very much influenced by the beatles sexy sadie and the ending of this track sounds a lot like the beatles flying fitter happier is a computerized voice and assortment of electronic sounds coming together in narrative that speaks of the perfect era of life and the lack of imperfection that comes with it truly it is the social core of ok computer that speaks of the flaws that come with government control over humanity the rest of the tracks are in their own rights amazing and probably some of the best songs i have heard in my entire life or will ever hear for that matter they do not quite stand out like the first portion of the cd but that does not make them any less great just not recognized,5.00,2058
my word this is the best album of the 90s radioheads definitive work ok computer is like tossing david bowie old u2 and lots of pink floyd into a blender it combines their excellent guitar work from the bends  their later electronic work on kid a  amnesiac its heavily layered and there is always something new to discover with each successive listen it is packed with electronica rhythms eerie keyboards and odd time signatures every song has its own unique beauty my god i have given this record over 50 spins over the years and i still love it,5.00,546
ed obrien about recording ok computer maybe the record sounds really different from everything else because we were not listening to everything else before we went to record we were listening to stuff like dj shadow underworld ennio morricone marvin gaye and early pink floyd then when we were in the studio there was a conscious decision to shut ourselves off from music because you can get panic attacks i have done that before i once put on london calling by the clash and i thought god how can anybody beat this album we might as well just give up now so we do not do that anymore because it is bad for morale that is how you beat it,5.00,637
do not know what else to say strangely i strongly disliked radiohead at first then well they grew and grew over years and years pretty brilliant stuff and this album tops them all,5.00,179
one of the best albums of all time paranoid android still gives me shivers,5.00,74
i got ok computer about a year ago after about 5 listens the whole thing just clicked it really hit hard even though i was over a decade late listening to this i was still blown away by it it is reputation is impossibly high yet it still blew me away it consists of 12 very unique songs 12 songs that each have their own personality each song is incredible and the ideas contained within each one are finely tuned and potent i have wondered for quite a while what i would say when i reviewed this it is such a fantastic and landmark album that has been examined and reviewed so many times anything that could be said about this album has been said countless times before there is nothing new that i can say about this album there are no new insights or understandings that i can share all i can say is this this album is just as incredible as everyone says ok computer truly deserves the acclaim it has received countless times,5.00,927
undoubtedly one of most creative epic and sonically original albums of all time thom yorkes voice can haunt you like a ghost and wrap you up like a blanket all at the same time the lyrics are at times ridiculous and obtuse at other times painfully touching the album takes about five listens or so to sink in but it is absolutely worth it any band that can write an album about how technology dehumanizes us with such warmth and bredth deserves more than a pat on the back it is difficult to articulate how amazing this album is in a wordbrilliant ohand may i submit paranoid android as coolest rock song ever,5.00,609
one of the greatest albums i have ever heard it takes several listens to get the point but with patience you end up observing its great quality and its large number of nuances,5.00,175
a revolutionary album that succeeds in several ways the writing is brilliant the melodies are consistently haunting and beautiful and with a guitarbased architecture that cemented radioheads status as one of the best guitardriven bands ever it is also on this album that thom yorke begins to garner recognition as a talented vocalist no doubt about it a masterpiece,5.00,365
i gave this cd 5 stars because this album is and was a huge leap forward for them it helped lead the way to kid a and amnesiac but at the time this was a completely new sound for them this is when they started to get into all the electronics synthesizers and other effects that made them famous my personal favorite off of this cd is paranoid android this is definitely an album that people should have because its weird music the way its supposed to be done,5.00,458
i think that this album is a perfect mix of the bends and kid a probably because they wrote it between them obviously i think the style is the best of what radiohead has to offer paranoid android is a great rock song i like music that moves and that song moves giving off emotion and feeling the entire way the album as a whole is great so do not just listen to one song,5.00,370
quite possibly the greatest rock band to come out in my lifetime,5.00,64
unbelievable album it took me a few listens to truly appreciate the depth and genius of ok computer but the repeated exposure paid off and now i throw it in all the time and just listen to it straight through then go back to whatever musical mood i happen to be in what can i say that has not already been said its a masterpiece,5.00,328
an exception of an album that has to be in my case listened a few times before it starts growing to biblical heights art of modern rock vs electronica itself a classic nonetheless,5.00,179
amazing absolutely amazing the alltogether sound of the songs on this album are breathtaking dauntng and awe inspiring i recommned ok computer to anyone and everyone,5.00,165
evidently one of the best rock albums ever made and i am not saying that by any influence it is simply a gorgeous genius and inspired record the mixture of sadness eletronica flowing sounds and rhythm makes this album a obligatory reference to anyone who are interested in knowing how music should be dealt with respect love and creativity put this record on close your eyes and feel what it can make for you nothing compares to it,5.00,431
this in an album of absolute transcendental beauty undoubtedly this is the album that i have listened to the most and somehow i am still not bored with it as soon as airbag kicks in it has me grinning at the world as strange electrical impulses wizz round may head making me feel alive in a way that is unsurpassed i got this album the day it came out back when i was only 15 from that moment on things were never the same again i listened to it from the beginning got as far as exit music and then listened to that one track about 20 times in a row in fits of excitement as i felt thoms voice speak to me in ways i would never known before i then spent the next 2 years listening to ever nuance of this album since then i have come a long way and my tastes have changed dramatically but i know that i will always be able to come back to ok computer and love it it seems to me that this is an album that you really have to absorb yourself in and allow it to take control those who do not rate is as 1 probably find it hard to do this and so cannot see it for what it is sometimes i really pity thom yorke and his chums because as authors of this immense work they probably cannot grasp how remarkable it is,5.00,1206
the sequel to the bends and just as good i love radiohead and i love this album my favorite song would have to be no suprises and the classic karma police but it is hard to single out songs when the entire album is a masterpiece,5.00,228
you cannot deny this brilliant album a place amongst the very best they manage to take you to a futuristic crepuscular place which has enormous beauty but will never be your home,5.00,178
there was a time that i did not hold out much hope for music then i heard ok computer this record reminds me of everything i look for in great music,5.00,148
nothing flows better then the voice of thom yorke and his fellow musicians on this album a truly beautiful moment in music at the time radiohead is a band of genius capablilities and this is evident in the work of ok computer if you want music to remind you of the night sky or the universe this is truly the stuff stand out tracks karma police paranoid android subterranean homesick alien no suprises and lucky,5.00,411
brilliant absolute genius distilled on to a plastic disc,5.00,56
first of all i would like to say that other peoples opinions about music almost never mean anything with that said i am going to verbally squeeze every bit of life from ok computer until the album is nothing more than a frisbee if you are ever tired bored depressed sick confused overwhelmed scared lonely sad or just hate life turns the lights out plug in your headphones and let thom yorke remind you that the whole world is secretly mourning with you let the echoing guitars and magnanimous choral backgrounds yearn with you let the xylophones play you a lullaby you will feel much better this album is there when you need it most it does not promote the band it promotes your soul it is your teddy bear but it is alive so do not squeeze it too hard or it will run away and never come back then you will hate yourself and the album,5.00,834
greatest album of all time period the opening bass line on airbag let us you know you are in for a real treat,5.00,109
this is edgy atmospheric rock at its best this radiohead album is less poppy that pablo honey and the bends and takes their led zepplinpink floydinspired sound to new levels the compositions are denser but not so arthouse that they are lost on most listeners kharma police is one of their most realized pieces moving from a creepy low tempo to one of thom yorkes ghostly wails the band is going for the sound of an electronicantiseptic world and they pull it off chillingly,4.50,473
a great record this and radioheads best to date experimental without being anal or atonal forward looking and backward looking big small loud quiet beautiful monstrous and charming not for everyone perhaps but certainly the best album by any band to come out of the 90s british rock scene,5.00,288
one of the best albums of the 90s the sheer amount of work that was put into ok computer is evident on every single song with dreamy guitars and excellent production throughout it might take a while to get used to but boy it just moves you so much once you realise its beauty i love every song on here apart from fitter happier but then that is just a halfway breather to get over the sheer brilliance preceding and following it the opening song airbag starts with a strange bassy riff from jonny his guitar turning to cello every once in a while while ed obrian plays pleasant arpeggios over the top with its strange production effects and complex arrangements this song works as a perfect opener for the album after the car crash survival of airbag we get to hear one of the albums most epic songs the humorous paranoid android probably also the only song that has lyrics that seem pretty random and not about much yet still used in a way that you can say the lyrics are good  that is what a genius thom yorke is the song itself starts of with a groovy beat that leads into ferocious guitar duels between jonny greenwood and ed obrian and a slow second half with vocals overlapping one another until another smash of guitar solos ends the track  amazing then comes the aquaticsounding subterranean homesick alien about alien abduction with a jazzy verse and beautiful chorus exit music for a film comes next a story about two lovers escaping from a overprotective father based upon romeo and juliet this song is slow and some say it is depressing but i find it is morbid undertones actually quite beautiful when thom begs his lover to breathe keep breathing while an electronic choir sings in the background it sends shivers down my surprise it took me a while to like the next track let down but both the lyrics and the chorus are quite beautiful and at the end there are several vocals overlapping at once with all the instruments going as well showing a clear example of just how complex radiohead can make their music karma police at first seems like quite a humorous song with it is slow but catchy chorus but the second half of the song is beautiful and jonnys piano playing sounds great fitter happier is basically an interval although the instruments behind the robotic voice sound nice if a little depressing electioneering is a more conventional rock song with a good chorus and a great guitar solo at the end climbing up the walls is dark and eerie with rising strings and a horn solo no surprises is a nice nursery rhymetype song with poetic lyrics and a pleasant instrumental section lucky is a brilliant song with the chorus a beautiful cry for help from yorke with superb guitar playing from jonny this kind of seems like radioheads comfortably numb if you ask me the albums outro the tourist is considered by many not as good as the rest of the album admittedly it is nowhere near as complex or as compressed but i actually quite like the way it is open and spaced out it is like you have been compressed and isolated throughout the album and at the end it is letting you out with a nice easy song to listen to overall ok computer is in my opinion radiohead at their very best and finest moment consistent throughout it is a dreamy and fantastic soundscape of wonderful music and i would certainly recommend it to those who have not heard it yet,5.00,3363
back in 1997 i had heard so much about radiohead that i needed to see what all the hype was about all i knew about them was the song creep because everyone knew it i had the bends  but somehow i never got around to listening to it and i kind of forgot i even owned it i was really interested in listening to ok compyter so when i bought it and got in my car i listened to the cd immediately curiosity had gotten the best of me i immediately understood that this album was exceptional i consider myself a person with very good taste in music i appreciate many different kinds of music ranging anywhere from classical to rap to numetal to eastern music except country music when i listened to this album for the first time i felt like i had to listen to it over and over after listening to this album several times i listened to the bends and immediately saw their seemingly natural progression to ok computer the bends is a very very good album but it is of the same type of guitar music that was popular at the time ie oasis blur smashing pumpkins ok computer takes the bends and mellows it out with sweeping guitars and oftentimes dreamy melodies add electronica mixed with thom yorkes passionate vocals and you get somewhat of an idea of what this album is about i realize that there are people out there who dislike radiohead and that is ok i am not trying to convert anyone to be their fan but i really do think that this album is sophisticated and groundbreaking and deserves a chance to be listened to my personal opinion of radiohead the beatles experimented with music and the world got brilliance radiohead as a band do not follow and create top 40 type of music radiohead do choose to grow and move into different directions and with each album they definitely accomplish that many bands and musicians follow and create the same type of music in their time period and that music is ok for many people yet few choose to make their own path because it might mean less popularity less sales etc and therefore these period bands go with what is tried and true they are the bands that release album after album of the same type of music never evolving often stagnant i think this band will be remembered for their originality and although maybe not extremely popular meaning on the radio in our day and age they will have opened the door for a new music yet to come,5.00,2370
after the critical acclaim of radioheads previous masterpiece the bends from 1995 there was a lot of pressure for them to deliver the goods for a second time in a row while most critics were probably expecting the band to produce a good album i am sure the majority did not expect it to be as good as it turned out the first hints as to what the album might sound like came from the first single and second track on the album the six and a half minute paranoid android an amazing series of ideas ranging from percussive melancholic quiet sections to extremely loud pixies style guitar work i feel it is undoubtedly the albums true highlight with the exception of android and the angry political electioneering influenced by elvis costello and featuring more jagged guitar playing the album falls into three sections slow majestic ballads melancholy acoustic laments and more experimental electronic tracks opener airbag is probably the most successful of the more experimental songs its strange cut up drum patterns and flanged guitars evoking technological breakdown track nine climbing up the walls is another strange song featuring a radio being tuned in the background against a menacing synth bass line and gently strummed guitars the two acoustic based songs on offer are immensely poignant especially exit music for a film which was influenced by shakespeares romeo and juliet it builds to an immensely powerful climax featuring fuzz bass and a raw drumbeat which never fails to send a chill down the spine whenever it is played the majority of the album however is taken up by a series of amazing majestic ballads the most effective of these in my opinion are the smiths inspired let down and the epic closer the tourist on both of these tracks the guitars chime beautifully and the choruses brim with emotion many have imitated this kind of song writing but none have managed to produce better music than these particular tracks in my opinion the album closes beautifully with a trio of amazing songs no surprises lucky and the aforementioned the tourist the chime of a triangle at the very end of this last track was the perfect way to end radioheads peak album,5.00,2171
now that is an album actually gets better with every listen first class a true statement of lyrical and musical genius anyone who does not rate this can smell my cheese,5.00,168
this is the best album of the 1990s  i know everyone says so but it is true i cannot lie,5.00,88
it is amazing how ok computer can really bring you up or put you down i think it is the best album ever made i listen to all kinds of music but radiohead is definitely my personal favorite i think the two most important songs in this album are paraniod android and exit music for a film i can listen to the entire cd a hundred times a day this last song exit makes me feel passionate i can feel the sadness and rage in thom yorke how many have to do that run away from home because of peoples rules and wisdom i agree i hope that they all choke,5.00,544
if i had to choose one cd this would be it a true classic in every way the best cd to listen to on headphones ground breaking stuff,5.00,131
in the day and age of the popradio single radiohead managed to create a sonic masterpiece that spanned an entire album from the vaguely disconcerting opener airbag to the soaring guitars of subterranean homesick alien to the almost abrasive second half of paranoid android they manage to lure the listener into an alternate world of a stark battle between man and machine called the dark side of the moon of the 90s ok computer firmly established radiohead as one of the premiere rock bands of the past 10 years with new meaning unearthed upon repeated listenings this album is sure to have staying power well beyond its shelf life,5.00,631
like this is the first time i have been all about a song that was mucho overplayed on the radio karma police and i still love the thing years later without even thinking about it they are so up there as one of the greatest bands right now,5.00,238
in my opinion the true test of great music is time some albums are great because they capture a certain age but then the listener in decades to come may find it hard to relate to the lyrics and feel ok computer is special because it certainly does capture an age but i feel listeners in years to come will still be able to listen and understand the message this is because ok computer is about a situation and depression in our world that is worsening daily and will continue to do so with the development of machine by man ok computer describes a world has no faith in god or others where humankind is speedily evolving into a heartless computerbrained technologygoverned society the songs describe aliens plane crashes a young boy rescuing his love from her cruel fathers fortress haunting by demons robots imagine star wars with a beautiful script it is hard to i know this album at first seems like the biggest downer however once you start listening to the lyrics it becomes something more the most amazing collection of songs i have ever heard and i am sure it is message about our cold society will apply just as effectively in fifty years from now,5.00,1155
radioheads masterpiece is here this has a deep and textured atmosphere and has masterfully crafted lyrics to compliment it,5.00,122
an amazing album a ton of great unique songs with extremely creative songwriting when i first started visiting this site and noticed that this album was the number 1 highest rated release i was very dissapointed to see it above many releases i loved i did not care for this album at all so i gave it a 05 star review since then starting with paranoid android this album has slowly but steadilly grown on me i now really love it sigh thom yorke you win best tracks airbag paranoid android exit music karma police no suprises,5.00,523
interesting album not my favorite but its a pretty good album in comparison to come other artists,4.00,97
i mean this is the highestrated album on the site i do not think i really need to say much here an incredibly consistent set of tracks not their best but it is a great pick for it great variety of ideas and sounds all of them executed excellently a true masterpiece key tracks exit music for a film let down climbing up the walls no surprises lucky rating 9,4.50,357
one of the best critically acclaimed albums ever so i figured it was time to check out this album let me start by saying that it is literally the perfect length which is rare  i would love to write and talk about this album but i do not think i can say anything more than over a thousand people who have posted their reviews here so in short this is an album that i listened to with all my heart and soul that put me in a state of anxiety depression euphoria and melancholy in conclusion i can say with a clear conscience yes this album is a masterpiece although it is not a 1010 album,4.50,585
if only tom yorke did not sing if only his companions had beaten him and removed the microphone from his hand when he often and willingly launched into those irritating attempts at suffering melodic singing if only  maybe consider this discreet record but maybe not even since musically i do not find anything interesting,2.50,321
the album title is ironic because it truely describes what i think about this album it is ok lol it has some awesome moments but sometimes i felt so unhappy listening to this i felt depressing after i heard this and i did not like that so i had to put on some old classics after this the only song that did not make me depressed was electoneerring that song had that classic rock sound i was hoping i was going to hear more i thought radiohad had some cool songs creep but this was nothing like that,3.00,499
influenced by numerous artists such as the beatles smith queen rem miles davis can and bob dylan the music of radiohead feels the aesthetics of dismantling and combining genres they did the extreme of what alternative rock could do and they gave it their own sensibility to create an art rock masterpiece the lyrics of ok computer deal with a very gloomy and heavy subject but at the same time the sound of the album is so beautiful that you can immerse yourself in the emotions radiohead is trying to convey in particular tom yorkes lyrical vocals and experimental performancestyle production are absolutely essential elements in ok computer with ok computer radiohead made a far greater and greater leap than with the bends,4.50,725
ok i have never listened to radiohead before in my life except creep so this was my introduction to the one of the most critically acclaimed music acts of all time and i can say that i am not disappointed ok computer is definetely an emotionally charged and daring album many great and personal moments throughout the album and it is those moments that makes this album an enjoyable experience having said that though i do not feel like this is a 100 or a 95 for me it had the potential but something did not feel right that may be because i am not experienced in the genre so i most definetely come back to this album a few months later for now i am giving it a 90 highlights paranoid android amazing song karma police climbing up the walls lowlights subterranean homesick alien,4.50,779
while this album is usually held in high regard by a lot of music fans i do not see much of an appeal on it the historical context and general impact on its genre is not enough for me to dig the project unfortunately partially because the music itself feels so bland and lacking of original ideas there is not much going on artistically and that is where i stop really caring for the record i really believe a boring album is worse than a bad album there are a few tracks throughout the record that are kind of alright but it is so derivative and generic overall you all overhyping the shit out of it when in reality is just a mediocre top of the bell curve album yeah it is mid cry about it,0.50,691
radiohead  ok computer overall best tracks subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down fitter happier no surprises the tourist worst tracks na 94110,4.50,163
so i decided to listen to this seeing as it was the most acclaimed music on the website i intentionally never went after radiohead because i did not like what i heard from them on my radio creep was okay and i did not want to go into this album with a negative bias so i went on a jog and listened to the album start to finish i am not saying the album is bad i am just rating based on my personal feelings because music is subjective and nothing is ever truly good great or bad merely because that is just how you feel there is no way somebody elses opinion on an album is the exact same as yours thought for thought this album just demonstrates what i hate about alternative rock songs like airbag paranoid android and climbing up the walls are slow to get through and did not do anything for me the production is the biggest problem here as it dates the album and specifically dates it to a period in music where i just feel like there was not much of anything good whoever their vocalist is he just is not cutting it and his voice sounds annoying to me the drum sound is annoying and they keyboards do not do anything interesting to me the guitar is interesting at certain parts though it is not like i did not like anything i thought exit music for a film had decent things about it albeit mired by the vocals and dated production i actually thought let down was good and there were some decent moments on lucky overall though i did not enjoy this if you do good on you for liking something i do not,1.00,1504
this album came to me by chance in a moment of existential crisis and right away i loved it i do not know if it matches my mood or if there is a certain ease of listening to the songs so calm and melancholy that they even have a comforting tone i really like albums that have a linear ambience almost as if a thematic atmosphere had been created where the album flows and sounds like a single song obviously very varied but without losing the focus imposed on this thematic atmosphere with all these elements on the table it is impossible not to consider this album as one of the best i have ever heard i confess that it was a pleasant surprise to discover that the image i had of radiohead was somewhat wrong in this album the band proves to be very competent technically doing the basics very well and including some new elements in a punctual and precise way giving a touch of modern pink floyd as much as this album is from 97 it was only in 2021 that i had the curiosity to listen to it stimulated by a friend who recommended it to me and i must confess that by far this was one of my sweetest discoveries this year highlights of the record airbag subterranean homesick alien exit music clibing up the walls and the tourist,4.50,1228
before kid a radioheads name value a masterpiece representing fame,3.50,66
radioheads ok computer is a cold depressing yet beautiful album to listen to taking the concepts of loneliness and pain and showing that through an amazing body of music,4.50,169
so this is what the 1 album sounds like i mean there are most definitely worse records to put on the throne i guess i know i am starting off negatively but this album is really solid every track here is really excellent and the replay value is pretty good too every song is something that basically demands you return to it but i cannot join the hordes of people who give it a 50 i honestly hesitate to keep it at 45 but we will give it time it is not that it is bad because it is truly brilliant for the most part paranoid android comes to mind first and foremost it is just boring at times which i know it is probably a punishable crime to say that on this site but i have to be honest here i do not know maybe it got overhyped considering it is literally the highest rated lp on the whole site i just expected something a little more engaging i found myself zoning out at different points across the 53 minutes and i am not sure if that is radioheads fault or my own adhd as of right now this sits just under the bends and leagues ahead of pablo honey great great stuff that i will be listening to for a while but definitely overrated,4.50,1137
ok computer brimming with genuine emotion beautiful and complex imagery and music and lyrics that are at once passive and firebreathing,5.00,135

aotd radiohead  ok computer 1997 i guess it is time to review this bad boy airbag is already starting off strong the drums sound steady and heavy and i like the tempo of them it is an interesting song indeed and genuinely had the gears in my head turning that final stretch sounds like boards of canadas geogaddi ngl paranoid android has a lot of interesting sounds to bring to the table really love this one perhaps more than airbag i did not expect to like this album this much at first listen but here we are i love experimental music when done right this is groundbreaking what a song that is subterranean homesick alien with a chill and atmospheric intro it transitions almost perfectly into a conglomeration of just anxiety if turned into music the only thing i kind of have an issue with is thom yorkes vocals can be kind of off at times after 2 songs dragged on here we are with karma police quite the song i like this one a lot especially the piano and the drums definitely a highlight of the album again his vocals just make me uncomfortable lol but they are not terrible sometimes he sounds good electioneering is a good change of pace from whatever the hell fitter happier was lmfaoooo upbeat and heavy i like it i can see myself playing this banger again in the future yet again getting some boards of canadas geogaddi vibes on climbing up the walls one of the best on the album creepy and spooky and gives an incentive that something is coming building up to something badass song damn damn the tourist is a damn good ending it is so damn impactful good lord amazing by all angles one of the best endings i have heard in a while hot damn 910,4.50,1655
radiohead at the best and peak in their career this album is unique and mixing rock and indie music the lyrics are amazing and thom yorke is writing from his soul about change the future and being lonely fav tracks subterranean homesick alien karma police climbing up the walls and no suprises,5.00,293
low 4550 two records into radioheads prestigious discography i understand now what all the hype is about i would not say i think ok computer is necessarily deserving of the 1 spot it currently holds but i loved the album and genuinely think that radiohead is a talented band not only as players but also as songwriters ok computer is a melancholic nostalgic and cohesive record which washes over the listener demanding to be absorbed its dynamism and dark lingering undertones make each song a unique piece to the larger picture the end result being a quality album maybe not the greatest rock album of all time but it is definitely deserving of its praise,4.50,656

introduction radiohead is quite possibly the greatest altrock group to ever exist not only did their albums age very well but the production on their albums have remained very complex and precise this album specifically discusses the nowcommon topic the disadvantages of technology and it does a good job at pointing out ironies of technology itself the album fuses progressive rock and electronic rock to create a very unique side of alternative rock radiohead already established themselves through the massively successful single creep ironically the record companies thought that ok computer would be commercial suicide for the band but it happened to be the opposite review the album ok computer has lyrics that have aged very well okc is one of the most ambitious records provided by the band the winterchristmas type production on airbag already sets in a rhythmicspooky mood for the listener the song points out an irony the song is about thoms car accident and how an airbag saved his life pretty ironic how technology can kill us and save us at the same time radiohead follows up the album with a more postprogressive rock song titled paranoid android the vocals are very laid back and soothing which could be compared to spelllings recent record the turning wheel yorkes lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a los angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine in particular yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilt a drink on her i love the acoustic guitar in the background syncing in with the bass and the electronicsynthesized guitar in subterranean homesick alien thom speaks of being isolated or different from the rest of his brethren he wishes an alien colony can take him away just so he could be a silent observer instead of an active participant in this unfair game we call life the concept is pretty relatable given the current status of our worldthe global pandemic just bringing in a whole new unintended interpretation to the song the winter type experimental production continues with the drums fusing in with synthesized bass guitars the vocals are pretty much similar throughout the entire record possibly the only repeated aspect of the album after watching a movie radiohead was very inspired to work on the track the result was exit music for a film a chillingly gentle song that bursts into a haunting crescendo of emotion appropriately the track was used as a closing credit to the film they watched i love the little alienated harmonisation created by the synthesizers and the amazing background drums the next track on the album continues the pattern of electronicprogressive rock fusion the song structure features multilayered arpeggiated guitars and electric piano with unconventional time signatures and a spectoresque wall of sound i love the gibberish vocals halfway through the track well not really gibberish but pretty undisputed vocal ranges were used which came off as a good aspect karma police possibly the greatest hit from the album had a laid back piano recursion the drums are a tad bit generic and the track mixing is pretty generic too compared to the rest of the albumvery experimental album it falls short in terms of originality karma police is a haunting and atmospheric track thom yorkes strained lackadaisical vocals are at once warm and sinister echoing the delusions of an addict in the midst of a narcotic meltdown musically the band follows a creamy dreamlike chord progression that makes use of an old beatles melody laid out on the piano to create a velvety bed of uneasy comfort fitter happier is a track predicting the future of technological exploitation fitter happier is a list of bullet points that diagnosed society for what it was and where it was headed at the time of this songs release and arguably the world we live in now the synthesized piano chords create such a horrifying atmosphere i honestly got scared when listening to this song considering the very unexpected vocal frequencies and the dark turn on the instruments electioneering is a more upbeat green day type song the song made me nod my head for four minutes straight i love the hard usage of the electric guitar and the drum snares one of the most replayed tracks from the album in my opinion sung from the perspective of paranoid fear itself climbing up the walls takes the english idiomatic expression for utter unpleasant feelings such as worry and doubt giving the expression a voice i would define this song as scary just like the band did the hardhitting drum productions supported by birds chirping create a very good opening atmosphere then the track is followed up with eerieambient sounds i love how the production vocal samples and instruments are all connected with each other no surprises seems to talk about the initial burnout an artist faces while making music the song uses a slowed down xylophone with peaceful yet generic drum notes the song is way more tolerable for a newer radiohead fan maybe this is the reason why this track is the last single from the album reflecting on the first track lucky compliments airbag as thom finds himself in a position where he is yet to discuss his deepest fear longdistance travelling the choir type chorus is so damn peaceful and soothing i love the instruments on this song too the 12th and the final track on the album the tourist ends off with a peaceful essence punctuating the album with soaring guitar solos and ethereal vocals the track is about enjoying life when a tourist visits a place he usually feels like he has to do a lot to take in the sights making him move at a fast pace hence thom telling him to slow down track by track review airbag 1010 paranoid android 1010

overall ratingapproximately 114120 or 95 conclusion this album marks a very important lesson for record companies you can be experimental and still get a shit ton of sales the album is so staggering that i could not find anything other than the repeated boring vocals throughout the album to criticize a revolutionary record for rock up there with pink floyds wish you were here and the beatles

ok computer is a masterpiece that much is i feel not up to debate if a piece of art maintains such a firm hold on its cultural zeitgeist holding a legacy as an embodiment and a pinnacle of a particular moment then there is no other word for it the ultimate impossibility of ok computer however is separating it from that moment it is not a living work it is a relic a point in time where pop culture was on the precipice of a shift the epistemic value of the album as an art form in fact every structure of our lives was up in the air as the digital age loomed over us building a tension for the oncoming antisocial singularity of athome consumerism and distance as the norm ok computers cover art its photo negative cityscape with dapples of pop art depicts the new worlds life out of balance the reggioesque blurred out dirge of modernity now pictured as distinctly unnatural antinatural in form radioheads vision of the world is one only possible in the age of the personal computer and the dissociations which come through an irreversibly interconnected world just as life in the coming millennium the photograph is a blurred swirl of light disjointed from its meaning and so it is for the album proper nowhere is this dystopian perspective more obvious than fitter happier my personal favorite track on ok computer it is here that the band properly embrace synthetic sounds enclosing the piece in atmospheric waves of droning noise while a somber piano piece seeps through its layers of distortion against it is a collection of sampled dialogue too quiet to make out while in the foreground you hear a texttospeech poetry reading of the best words yorke has ever written it is a series of fragments a narrative generated from their connection the piece is written as a free association of points with the line drawn in its execution portraying the ideal life of a modern citizen key words more productive it is a life with the edges sanded off falling into a dull middle ground  enjoy a drink now and then slower and more calculated a pig in a cage on antibiotics the power that this capitalist ideal has is one of ideological influence the structure of life itself serving as a pedagogy for the production of good workers obedient and fallow it worms the imperfections into ones subconscious while we create an image of normalcy for ourselves cogs which collapse slowly inward the flashes of violence in the imagery providing descriptions of cruelty to animals as broken repressed urges ones which only exist in the back of the mind and can never be expressed or dealt with for fear of the consequences which result of being marked as an outsider the song points outward and inward its threadbare imagery serving to illuminate a societal authoritative web of ideology this is generally the mode which makes radiohead perform at their best abstraction with a clear direction there is a clear sense of sonic worldbuilding in something like fitter happier something which translates to the more rockoriented sound of airbag which truly sounds like the albums cover art the guitar melody which introduces it feels almost like pure melody an indescribably fluid sound which provides something of an opening theme for the album it fully captures what the album sets out to do which is examine and represent a world of evanescent glimmers of life airbag is the sound of a breath building to a climax of a quietus which introduces radioheads growing cultural vocabulary taking the alt rock style they honed on the bends and expanding it out to tinges of progressive rock and trip hop it moves them into a new space which generally feels more exhilarating and modern its sterility is backed up through an emotional range which was not present on the first two albums which makes the highpoints more effective the problems come when the group shy away from that atmosphere opting for more hooky energetic music electioneering is frankly the worst song radiohead has ever made they cannot effectively sell this kind of heavier rock sound and the result is an awkward mess of a bland riff with thom yorke shouting outside of what he can do interestingly it is the highest energy that the album reaches and it feels completely out of place the lyrics as well are uncharacteristically straightforward where fitter happier points to a world out of balance electioneering instead exclaims its message while maintaining an imprecise attitude towards it it critiques the platonic ideal of a politician but the subject has no ties to any party or alignment it simply goes down the middle critiquing a subject we all know is corrupt there is no power to its protests as they are directionless in more of a craft issue however the album fails in its most ambitious moments exit music for a film for example is built around an overwhelming crescendo but both its rise and conclusion are far too abrupt to have weight more consistently disappointing though is paranoid android which is a suite in the vein of wings band on the run or queens bohemian rhapsody but it shifts between its moments too quickly failing the atmosphere which it often comes very close to building what it comes down to is that ok computer has higher highs and lower lows than anything radiohead had done to this point ultimately that might be what makes its legacy particularly fascinating it is anything but mediocre diving into a strange auteurism which is irreplaceable while they are fully derivative of many other bands nobody else could make this particular album at this particular time the blend they discovered here is lightning in a bottle counterculture which lands at a time which makes its ideals completely natural and ordinary for the world at large it is the definition of middlebrow something which provides a pleasant challenge and rewards a focused listen just slightly more than their mainstream contemporaries did,3.00,5892
i only like track 11 on this album there is a nice freeflowing tune and a nice atmosphere elsewhere the only thing i found to be above average is atmosphere on tracks 3 and 5 with plenty of bells and whistles beyond that everything is average at best there are hardly any riffs the melodies are mostly mediocre the vocalist is rather mediocre and the sound  production and atmosphere are mostly average or nonexistent with the above exceptions i gave this best album of all times all the respect i could muster with at least 10 spins over a period of about as many years it peaked at about 7th8th listen when i thought i might eventually like the thing however after that the level of enjoyment dropped sharply and during my final listen i did not manage to complete a single song apart from track 11 because they all sounded utterly boring from 010 riffs 2 sound  production 6 tunes 4 vocals 5 atmosphere 6 song structure 5 consistency 5 originality 5 heaviness flyweight accessibility 23 listens lastability 5,2.00,1011
come on ok computer is one of the most highly regarded albums out there and you are sitting here reading reviews on rym give the album a listen and decide for yourself,5.00,167
ok computer is one of the few albums i would describe as nearly impossible to review it is the type of album you will either walk away from loving or absolutely despising you are reading a review of an album that is many peoples number 1 album of all time nothing said here matters all i can say is give it a listen and decide for yourself,4.50,339
it lived up to the hype to say the least and i think this is quite accessible for any newcomers who want to start getting into more music a record like this can be an eyeopener in terms of what music can do,5.00,206
yknow there is something about ok computer radioheads infamous ok computer seems to be this websites favorite album and it is clear to see why radiohead is one of the most innovative and groundbreaking bands of all time most of the songs on here are great and it is one of my personal favorites the album starts with airbag which is one of my favorite intro tracks of all time it always gets me hyped with its energy and the guitar on it is insane paranoid android is in my opinion the bands best track it starts with a catchy riff and a fantastic vocal performance from thom then 2 minutes in the tracks goes bonkers with an exciting build leading to an awesome midsection to the track then the track chills down with a beautiful vocal performance by thom and then it ends off with a powerful riff subterranean homesick alien is another great track with beautiful melodies scattered around the track exit music is a silent beautiful track with amazing vocals from thom then 3 minutes into the track it goes insane and it is a highlight from the album let down is another great track with a memorable melody and vocal performance karma police is the biggest hit from the album and it is clear to see why it has a memorable melody deep lyrics and one of my favorite vocal deliveries from thom electioneering is a very unique and heavy cut from the album and it is different from the rest of the album the bassline on climbing up the walls is amazing and it is a very unique but welcome vocal performance no surprises is beautiful and memorable being one of my favorite cuts off the album thoms vocals the beautiful melody and the replayability of the song make it the one i find myself always coming back to lucky is another fantastic song from the album with a very memorable vocal performance and a great bass hook the tourist ends the album out fantastically with another memorable vocal performance overall this is definitely in my top 5 albums of all time and it is clear to see why it is still at the top,5.00,2009
i am not going to sit here and say this albums overrated because they had to have done something right in order to garner this much acclaim i just did not get the appeal,1.50,169
generation x witnessed in real time the artistic meaning of this work that indie rock of his debut film and the sharp guitars of the bends did not presage such an amazing captivating and innovative evolution as ok computer turned out to be the album was a turning point for rock of its time a sonic bomb that exploded in your sky the 21st century started here ok computer has exerted a seminal influence on the scene connecting rock with electronics and much of their own capturing what was happening around him like no other reading generation x but above all heralding the millenninal era ok computer was a spell that everyone openly drank from a true masterpiece from start to finish an album that blends the atmospheric and intimate with the unstructured and robotic where shrill and angular guitars merge with processed drums and synthesizers that rehearses distressing and sordid climates while imprinting an epic character on the songs ok computer is the record of the 90s immortal and unforgettable in its own right which definitively collapsed the barriers between rock and machines still retrogradely prevailing a feat that marked the pulse of times to come and the central axis of a trilogy unattainable for their contemporaries the bends  ok computer  kid a radiohead was the band that understood the true legacy of the greats of history search experimentation and reinvention they dug into the periphery and drank from all sources from their most notorious krautrock influence to the modern contemporary idm aesthetic to continue evolving and sustaining over time an excellence rarely seen in the history of pop culture today we talk about sgt pepper ziggy stardust and the dark side of the moon our children and our childrens children will ask about him,5.00,1767
probably the aura of magic that surrounds them the boundless admiration that many have for radiohead is even excessive but with all due respect to their detractors obviously a not indifferent swarm of it is created for each band that rises to the fore have undoubtedly known create an original style and this record is one of the most important representations a mixture of pop rock partly also noise electronics with melancholy accents and energy discharges and in this sense the paranoid android suite well condenses the results of the musical research that is carried out with the disc in short it is a group that deserves at least most of the esteem and fame that most have always accorded it,3.50,696
honestly i do not know what more needs to be said this album is a good alt rock album with some ominous bleak climactic and emotional moments but generally it is really nothing special the highlights definitely live up to the hype though just go listen to in rainbows or kid a they are fucking awesome you might even have more fun with the bends as well if you want something more straightforward favorites airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien let down karma police electioneering lucky the tourist least favorites everything else yeah sorry but this album is really boring sometimes they shoehorn a bunch of mediocre or cheesy songs between great ones which is ultimately what makes this album just kind of alright yes i think exit music and no surprises are cheesy and mediocre cry about it 7510,3.50,812
ok so first things first conceptually this album should be a 1010 for me radiohead check moody artrock check lyrics about bleak modern society check i know that this is the intended effect but if this album had a colour it would be grey it has a very cohesive narrative that runs through most of the tracks but it also is really fatiguing listening to this album in one sitting the highs of this album are in orbit though paranoid android takes the moody depressing sound of this album and blows them out of the water with a screeching guitar solo eventually coming to a climax of a heavy guitar riff distorted screams and synthesisers out of the ass awesome karma police is a classic the entire production on this song is truly amazing if you scrub from the beginning to the middle to the end of this song they sound like different tracks yet the entire song feels complete and congruent fitter happier is very very good powerful and scarily accurate poetry that seems more relevant by the day no surprises is one of my favourite songs ever the gentle guitar riff thoms voice the overall musical arrangement and the lyrical content is so perfect to me the message of this song is that by a certain age we are expected to just fall into the mould that society has cast for us get a decent job a nice partner buy a house have 25 kids no alarms no surprises this really hits hard for modern society now this bleak way of life is the goal we are expected to go into tens of thousands worth of debt to get a decent job we are more lonely than ever house prices are rising at a unprecedented rate fertility rates are declining this boring depressing way of life is now the goal i am not much of a contrarian but i really do not think this album is perfect the highs are high and the lows are boring as all hell the 53 minute runtime feels at least twice as long however it is really damn close i really really like this album but i hate that i do not love it,4.00,1953
it is pretty understandable why this is so highly regarded it is good,0.50,69
ok computer marked a large change in themes for radiohead which headed in a bad direction i feel indifferent to many of the song in this album the highs include let down karma police no surprises and lucky these tracks are far more unique and sound fantastic other songs sacrifice it sounding pleasing for an experimental theme and others play it too safe the aformentioned song all achieve a middle ground which sounds sooo good paranoid android and exit music for a film both are quite popular but fall into the category of being too experimental and sacrificing nice sounds no surprises is very mellow though lyrically holds a dark undertone the contrasting sound a lyrics serves very nicely and is something new lucky has a solemn tone but sounds really nice it is very catchy but it does lack any experimental themes something this community seems to like karma police is the same very catchy with a solemn tone lyrics sound even more catchy and complement the instruments again it does lack very much experimental themes let down is likely the most catchy of the all the flow of the song is done very well and does not sound all that gloomy portions include that and other portions sound kind of positive album 810  carried by let down karma police no surprises and lucky,4.00,1277
i would preface this review by saying that my opinions are controversial but really how controversial can anything be when there is already a surplus of opinions from every perspective the first thought i had when i started listening to this album was crap did my equalizer blow out again it is almost uncanny how much the mixing on this track resembles the default settings on my headphones my second thought was intriguesure the lyrics are edgy but i had an emo phase so i have heard much worse besides there is a kind of hypnotic quality to the music and i was happy to even be thinking about the lyrics because that meant that it was not boring enough harmonically for me to lose interest truly the first three songs and maybe the fourth if i am feeling kind are greatthere are obvious flaws of course the droning vocals are a hit or miss for example but there is at least a baseline confidence in the execution by let down they have started to lose me i have heard too many songs on otherwise strong albums that try to use polyrhythms as their gimmick in place of real songwriting i have no strong feelings on karma police fitter happier is not exactly bad but it is not at all what i was expecting then i am zoning out again i am brought back by no surprises but mostly because it sounds more like something panic at the disco would write than the art rock i was promised the final songs try to reclaim some of what made the first few work but it is too little too late again from the first three songs alone i get the hype i can even understand why people love the other onesthe execution is clearly excellent but i guess i am not one of those people,3.50,1657
there are some absolutely incredible tracks on this album although i believe many of the songs on the second half are hardly comparable in quality with the exception of no surprises regardless this is an essential listen for anybody trying to get into music,4.00,257
the amount of praise that this album gets on this site is just annoying and laughable because this album is far from being the best thing ever released in fact it are not even top 100 worthy most of the songs on here like no surprises and karma police are completely bland and do absolutely nothing for me highlights electioneering a nice political hardrock song with an interesting riff and a pretty exciting guitar solo to close the song overall this is something that i do not want to listen to again,1.50,503
on second thought if you flip the chart upside down it is all right we have the worst album of all time,0.50,103
of course at the time of first listening i thought this was sooooooo amazing like omg ok computer wowowowoww so deep but now i have my own music taste and not a mucore virgin for the most part still do not mind this thing though its just whatever,2.50,246
most rock fans will say this is one of the greatest albums of all time i am no different ok computer is one of those musical experiences that everyone should experience at least once in their life this album has some of my favourite songs of all time electioneering no surprises let down i cannot see this band ever topping this album but they are definitely welcomed to try best songs no surprises electioneering let down airbag exit music for a film paranoid andriod karma police subterranean homesick alien worst songs climbing up the walls,4.50,543
after rigorous touring promoting their sophomore album lead singer of radiohead thom yorke felt both inspired by the travel yet unsettled with the way he saw the world advancing but everyone already knows that i cannot open my review that way i think to myself as i press down on the backspace key between cultural impact and emotional resonance ok computer is one of the greatest albums of all time and it will not be forgotten anytime soon well that is just obvious i critique as i once again backpedal after gaining momentum from the bends radiohead kicked things further into gear with ok computer experimenting with sounds to create the perfect ugh i tap delete let us face it it is impossible to review an album like ok computer as there is essentially nothing i repeat nothing you can say that people will want to hear especially not from some random guy on a music database so i will briefly say what it means to me it is one of the few albums i can safely credit as my gateway into music at large which has become a lifechanging passion these songs hold a special place in my heart and each one for completely different reasons much like how the band wrote them inspired by diversity and change 1010,5.00,1208
honestly i thought this album was going to suck but it surpassed my expectations i really enjoyed the atmosphere this album may be very very overrated but it is a worthwhile listen,3.50,180
top 10 best album of all time best album according to rateyourmusic is that some sort of joke paranoid android and karma police are pretty good but the rest just sound like tedious indierock mashed together with idiotic bleeps and bloops yeah this are not a masterpiece,2.00,269
a great album from start to sinish not a single song drags and i actually liked an interlude for once fitter happier fiuts very well after one of the most techno songs on the album karma police plays and makes the album feel very whole,5.00,235
 a fraction of my journey through the eminent rym top 100 as of 2021 ok computer at 1 one could only imagine a painfully frostbite winter chipping away at deadcarcass robots when they listen to this record or perhaps a calm storm something you watch off in the far distance as the winds gust grade by grade doom awaits but what does not heed are thom yorkes faraway alien vocals that ring throughout the rotting loudspeakers all you have for yourself is your wits kind of a dystopian concept deep fried in a freezer for the night guitars and drums as salt and pepper and what comes out is a bittersweet icicle ironically consumerism gnawed viciously on it is roots and tore apart it is circuits and now here it sits at the everlasting number one spot on rym the concept itself would earn ok computer a 5050 for me but this record really did not faze me in theory do albums owe me a broken jaw when i listen to them not really but for a release so highly praised it earns itself numero uno i anticipated something much more and that hunger is what killed my rating for this album a shame really listening through i juggled between an extremely high rating based on if i generalized how great it is versus a moderate rating based on my personal feelings on the album i went with my wits i would be lying if i were to suck off this album in a review generally speaking radioheads prized pig is an achingly bravo album the concept is tightly strung around each song and does not falter a minute the thematic genre of a dramatic siberian ballad holds true from airbag to the tourist the nippy guitars color the dead dancefloor with an arctic aptitude yet i am dissatisfied the filler of most of these songs kill that curiosity i had coming into this album let down climbing up the walls lucky and the tourist were all tracks i dismissed even on my fifth listen they clogged up the main powerhouse songs paranoid android exit music for a film karma police and airbag obviously i have a strong bias towards the more heavy soulcrushing rockditties and for an album whose purpose is to defrost onto the floor as ok computer is the slower songs should be the ones i favor the most exit music for a film has a dreamstate climax but the beginning is so barren i forget what is happening until the unforgettable summit no surprises is excruciatingly mediocre and paired with some of the weakest songs on the album it certainly makes me want to avoid it more i really want to love this album i adore the overall sound each track screeches and i can only beg for it to continue on yet every time i listen to this album my worries are reaffirmed the execution of the later songs is what kills the kid the topdog brainchild of thom yorke should have pulled more out of me for being the mascot of this website there is so much that could be explored yet yorke set camp out in the worst setting and the album starts off so strong,5.00,2910
zora neale hurston famously said happiness is nothing but a everyday living seen through a veil while working on ok computer thom yorke said we could really fall back on just doing another miserable morbid and negative record lyrically but i do not really want to at all and i am deliberately just writing down all the positive things that i hear or see i am not able to put them into music yet and i do not want to just force it yorke really aspired to make a beautiful record but if you have heard any of radioheads music you would know that he was not a very positive person that is where the uniqueness of this album lies thom someone who lived life without a veil had to try to find the beauty in our world a lot of people would say that this album is depressing or hopeless but it is really not at least not entirely airbag celebrates the preciousness of existence subterranean homesick alien poetically encapsulates our want to sometimes escape from daytoday life exit music for a film shows just how powerful love can be albeit in a somewhat alarming way and no surprises appeals to our hope for a peaceful death of course there is songs like climbing up the walls not saying these songs are unsuitable for okc but this album as a whole always leaves me feeling reassured it is a reminder that we are not alone in how we feel and for someone like me that is occasionally necessary that coupled with these sounds i am just so familiarized with makes this album a blanket of comfort the amount of emotion effort and luck that goes into making an album went into creating each song on here like fine wine ok computer is an album that gets better with age as time passes this albumll have more memories to evoke in me and more wounds to heal i look forward to that with every listen,4.50,1786
ok computer is a masterpiece is it overrated for sure is it the best album of the 90s of course not is it even the best album in the top 10 on this site probably ok computer gets a lot of shit and a whole lotta praise it is not radioheads best record and it probably takes 2nd behind hail to the thief so with such a negative start to this review what does this album get right welleverything thoms vocals are perfect as is the groups songwriting the instrumentals break out of the rockheavy style found on the bends not knocking the bends love that record and brings the group into more of an artrock territory while they still maintain plenty of originality and creativity the culmination of the bands work flourishes in two particular songs more than the rest no surprises and airbag airbag opens the album and it shows a clear difference from the ending of the bends street spirit fade out this one has a rock spirit but you can tell the band is not brooding as much they are not as angry as they are on the bends this shows vulnerability the band keeps the vulnerability going with no surprises which is easily a top 5 song alltime for me this song is so fucking heartbreaking it hurts me when i listen to it and i would call it radioheads best track if they had not made my favorite song a wolf at the door the real winner on this song is the culmination of thom yorkes vocals over top of the dreamy spacey instrumental the best example of what i am talking about is when thom enters the final section of the song in the wonderful music video you see his head burst out of water gasping for air and after the instrumental break this is exactly how the song makes me feel something about the way thom sings the line such a pretty house and such a pretty girl makes me fucking cry i mean it it is soulcrushingly beautiful and this is reflective of the rest of the album there are so many emotional highs and lows that this is one of the most complete album experiences you can ever really listen to while it might not be my favorite of all time or the 90s or of radioheads discography you can bet your bottom dollar that i will keep returning to ok computer until the day i breathe my final breaths and that is a fact jack,4.50,2226
this is one of my favorite albums ever at this point in my life i relisten often and with each completion new meaning is given to yorkes deep lyrics displayed with amazing vocals i might add and the stories behind them there are so many tracks on this album i love that i find it hard to rank them but i think my favorites are paranoid android no surprises lucky and the tourist the concepts and ideas from this album still hold up to this day 24 years later and i think that just goes to show how perfect it is and how it deserves a high spot in my heart for all of its latenight ponders about the twisted dark sicknesses with the world that i will never understand without a doubt i love this album it will never fail to disappoint me even when i am disappointed with everything late at night while i am driving take me on board of their beautiful ship show me the world as i would love to see it i would tell all my friends shit is catchy,5.00,941
radioheads third studio album ok computer is rightfully one of the best rock albums of the last century musical diversity conceptual integrity and message made this album an unshakable pillar that will be referenced and relied upon for decades to come at its core ok computer is a guitardriven opus about the decline of modern society the computerization of the world and the human being shackled within an agenda that celebrates capitalist ideas this album is a monumental essay  an observation about the longing the depression the anxiety that lives in every mind technological progress which gave a lot of good things to a person and made his life easier scares thom yorke  a soloist guitarist frontman and author of lyrics he is concerned about technologies that fetter a person the title track airbag tells of yorks fear of the transportation system the globalization of the car and what it might entail the song is a paradox that casts technology in a depressing light while at the same time saving lives the ideological message is most clearly illustrated in the compositions of paranoid android karma police fitter happier  modernity expects obedience from a person robotization of feelings and lifestyle you need to be a weakwilled creature capable only of procreation creating a new cell of society to increase capital modern values about the ideal person and life without troubles run counter to the depressive mental decline and anxiety inherent in every individual climbing up the walls and no surprises vividly illustrate these contradictions between political needs and what they entail psychological problems in particular paranoid thoughts visit to one degree or another every free person capitalism pushes this into the background and devalues people with such problems they are stigmatized and feared in the final track thom yorke uses the metaphor of the tourist as a modern person who is always running somewhere and in a hurry to see as much as possible but in fact he does not enjoy what he sees to the fullest all he needs is  slow down look around and live a free life the general atmosphere of decadence and melancholy of the lyrics is reinforced by guitar accompaniment complex riffs stringed multitiered melodies create an atmosphere of a dark and cloudless world that absorbs every person headlong,4.50,2326
i am going to keep this brief ok computer is the backdrop to something like 1984 exit music for a film the tourist and airbag all represent a dystopian utopia that the protagonist dreams to escape from while paranoid android and climbing up the walls push radiohead further forward as rock legends in how outlandishly bold they represented themselves calm down people just because it is not pink floyd or yes does not mean it is not a modern masterpiece that will stand the test of time along with the best of them,5.00,514
i do not know if i can properly describe how much i love this album everything in it just works so wellfrom the raw opening riff of airbag to the final ding of the triangle at the end of the tourist,5.00,198
i was really just not feeling this album like who honestly listens to this music there is too much happening for me to even comprehend what is happening also the album cover is too bad mixing is bad i truly do not understand why the kids love this album so much very bad 0,0.50,272
loved by many hated by many as well radioheads third and most critically acclaimed album is without a doubt a very important album even several years after its release while their earlier releases gained traction by getting released in an era of a huge britpop revival owed by a large factor to bands like oasis and blur this album is a significant step away from that sound while the song structures are still based on the same formulas as those first two albums the sounds they incorporate and the production drives them towards a more modern sounding approach and a futuristic approach as implied by the title the sparse use of electronics is done in a subtle and effective way adding dreamy soundscape like textures and enriching the compositions keyboards and string arrangements are also used throughout the course of the album creating a dense melancholic atmosphere the opening track airbag hints on the change of sound but is somewhat lacking and fails to hold the listeners attention paranoid android and karma police are two of the most well known songs from the album simple catchy melodies delivered in a confident tone that perfectly captures a band in transition but with enough experience to sound adventurous and massively appealing at the same time exit music for a film is probably the most depressive moment on the album relying on a very soft acoustic guitar melody and thom yorkes almost wailing vocal performance to provide an emotional release the album does get a little repetitive near the mid point with songs like electioneering and climbing up the walls failing to provide to much in the mix without them being bad it all pays up in the end though with no surprises and lucky being two of the finest moments on the album relying on the pessimistic tone that the whole album is built upon to offer a sense of final release from the sweet melancholy that runs throughout the album while ok computer is not their most experimental or their most groundbreaking effort it is definitely the finer point at which they found the perfect balance between being experimental and accessible it is true that the album has received a lot more attention than it deserves from a musical standpoint but its influence and importance in the direction art rock and several forms of indie rock would move in the years to come is unparalleled music wise it is undoubtedly a very good album that manages to sound fresh and enjoyable even after all those years it is the album that transformed radiohead from followers to leaders and established them as a huge name in the music industry granting them the freedom to experiment with their sound without having to worry to much resulting in some very interesting albums in the years to come,3.50,2744
everything has already been said about ok computer to the point where it is clich to even talk about how everything has already been said about it yeah it is one of the best albums ever made yeah the feelings of angst melancholy fear and solitude that it evokes are absolutely soulstirring and flawlessly composed in dreamy immersive and anxietyinducing soundscapes yeah it is so intricately structured and made from a place of genuine passion and heartbreak that it lends itself to analysis like the artsiest of artsy films endlessly mesmerizing and magnificently enigmatic and if you like music you are probably going to obsess about this album for the rest of your life i am not the one to tell you all that though right favorite tracks wet thom yorke least favorite track the tourist 1010,5.00,792
i mean it is the best rated album here but is it really like that it is really really good and the best radiohead album in my opinion the whole record has a nice atmosphere and in general is a well built album but how some people wrestled it as the best album in the world i do not really understand but anyway it is a wonderful album,3.50,334
ok computer is a masterpiece  there is no doubt that this album is a masterpiece from airbag to the tourist every song captures the dystopian future which was first conceptualised the melancholic instrumentals and vocals are a bitter sweet symphony which further enforces its message of the severe loss of connection in society at the time of its release the best songs which are featured in this album in my opinion are electioneering paranoid android and climbing up the walls these songs capture the rawer and harsher sides to radioheads discography which i feel is lost through later releases overall this is an amazing album however i believe it is only a starting point to the discography as i believe their sound becomes further perfected in later albums this album is really a classic from the 90s and a brilliant way to get into radioheads discography,5.00,860
bonechillingly beautiful,5.00,24
very pretty good a victim of overhype it is a good album it is a great reflection of drab modern society yada yada yada it is also slow and at times a little boring fitter happier is a pretentious song are those bad things to say i do not care,3.00,243
this album is everything rock music should be grade s favorite tracks let down climbing up the walls,5.00,100
an inspired release which rightly wins many plaudits the sound of this album was is quite unique and you have to admire the originality of the music on show i still prefer the bends as radioheads best ever long player and some of the tracks herein are a little bland hence i cannot really support this album being right up there in the all time top ten of albums ever released but fair enough it is a classic and i am sure an album that i will continue to revisit key track karma police,4.50,486
i cannot listen to this album without breaking down in tears every single song on this album is filled with so much raw emotion and power that i cannot listen with a straight face the album kicks me right in the heart straight out the gate with airbag the emotions in this song are too varied for me to even describle but it pales in comparison to the second song on this album paranoid android this is where most of my review will be focused on this one song this one beautifully terrifying song this song actually causes me to go into a schizophrenic breakdown and i wish i was exaggerating when i say that this song overloads my brain with so many emotions at once and i always break down in tears halfway through the song during the ambition makes you look pretty ugly section this song also has the greatest end section i have ever heard in any piece of music thoms tortured screams over the frantic guitar solo fills me with so much despair and desolation and i genuinely have no option other than to sit in it listening to the ending in full as it makes the feelings worse the next song that has such a profound effect on me is karma police the objectively sadder song this song is much less schizophrenic however so it is less effective that is not to say it does not affect me however the bridge alone is enough to make me break down in tears this song fucking hurts the soul to listen to as you hear thom ripping his heart out through his throat and it comes out with such beautifully devastating sounds i adore this song just as much as paranoid android the last song i want to focus on is electioneering this is a complete tonal shift from the rest of this album yet it still feels that it belongs this is such a cheery and energetic song and it helps ease my mind while listening along to the full album this gives me a breather from the constant despair and for that i feel this might be the most important song on the entire record overall this is in my opinon the greatest album of all time i could probably go on for hours and hours about each song but i will not make this any longer than it already is this is the only album i would genuinely give an 1110 this is a fucking ride and one that i recommend listening to at least once in your entire life,5.00,2269
this is radioheads most overrated album first i love this album i really do it is great 810 some of their best stuff but for me it ranks 5th in their discography ,4.00,162
i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this i love this,5.00,2039
i am almost 32 and it is the first time i listen to ok computer the highest rated album on this page for this moment i would been hating this band for no reason but i decided to give it a chance once and i already passed the kid a test and it turned out to be not as bad as i thought 35 stars in my opinion it was musically way more interesting than ok computer which is kind of regular but not one of the worst 90s rock but the worst thing about this album is thom yorkes vocal if they replaced it with that voice synthesizer from fitter happier this would get a star more when it is the way it is yorke ruins like everything and some of these tracks might have been okayish subterranean etc and electioneering still it is not that bad for 90s rock but it is not any good either,2.00,779
let us write my first review after using rym for 15 years why not start with ryms and countless publications  1 album ok computer the title of best album ever is a setup for disappointment so on first listen about ten years ago i was underwhelmed nowadays after listening to these songs at least once a year i am just whelmed i suppose i can understand why people like this album but the best album off all time that seems like a stretch mind you this is in no way a bad album if you rate this half a star you are probably an edgelord sonically or instrumentally it does not do anything new or interesting it is just standard alternative rock thom yorke voice is often described as whiny i do not disagree but it does not bother me i can appreciate a wide range of voices however i do not relate to him at all he leaves me emotionally unbothered some songs are genuinely good like karma police let down and lucky other ones like airbag no suprises and subterranean homesick alien are perfectly enjoyable the rest of the songs including paranoid android are just there they exist they are competent but i do not feel the need to listen to them again best song let down worst song fitter happier,3.50,1193
what else can be said about radioheads groundbreaking and widely beloved 3rd studio album ok computer one of the most largely celebrated albums and considered by many to be one of the greatest of all time it has gotten to a point where you cannot be in online music circles without any mention of this album you can say what you want about an album of this magnitude but i genuinely believe despite the hype it is anything but overrated overrated seems to be a term launched at any album someone does not like that happens to be loved by a large audience despite actually considering its significance and the subjectivity of music radioheads ok computer is as important to rock music as anything that came before or after and is a significant moment in their discography coming off of albums like pablo honey and the bends no one could have seen this one coming just around the corner ok computer dives into vivid imagery of an almost dystopian and technology ridden society through multiple breathtakingly gorgeous tracks songs like paranoid android with its multiple phases and let down with its just utterly eargasmic conclusion remain some of the most mindblowing i have ever heard the power of this album does not stop there as every track absolutely delivers to me and from front to back it does not waste your time the tourist may as well be the greatest album closer ever in my opinion and feels like i am floating on a cold blue sea spiraling out of control this album has been discussed to death from a musical standpoint and i feel as though there is more to say for my personal experiences with this work of art i am absolutely serious when i say that my music taste and the way i see music would not be the same if it were not for this album right here this album showed me that music can be emotionally powerful and can be meaningful to you as an individual once this album fully clicked for me my life had forever changed i vividly recall sitting in my room hearing the end of let down and realizing this album was something special realizing that this band was something special ok computer was one of the main albums to get me through this past summer and has since stuck with me radiohead have a near flawless discography in my opinion and remain my favorite band of all time but ok computer to me has something special as highly praised as ok computer is it deserves every damn ounce of praise it gets not one moment on this album would i dare to change and is a true astounding feat for radiohead the album that changed my life,5.00,2547
from how i see it this is a mostly forgettable but still enjoyable rock record from the 90s nothing terribly groundbreaking but some decent songs and one fantastic moment in fitter happier maybe if i knew more about the backstory of the record i would get it but as of now its decent not much more and i probably will not be returning to it anytime soon but decent none the less 610,3.00,382
the highlight of the album is karma police but even so it does not offer much beyond some spirited vocals in the second half of the song the songs are invariably unpleasant cold and depressing if you are someone who listens to music for the purpose of pleasure i cannot recommend ok computer i suppose someone who was in a dark and dreary state of mind might find some company here but it is not for me,1.50,402
i want to shriek as much as the thom for the first 5 songs karma police does wonders but is not enough to save the album by itself no surprises is ok i guess the album does good in bringing out my emotions of pain listening to it best song is karma police,1.00,255
i do not need birth control because unfortunately this album is an absolute masterpiece there are no flaws the percussion immaculate i cannot believe i am praising this album right now but yeah the song structures are so varied like i said free birth control ig,4.50,261
24 years later it still stands out the production in this album still kicks ass even compared to todays standards the dystopian feel is so overwhelming that it sounds like coming straight from somewhere between 2040s i cannot really decide if this shits overrated or not maybe both mopey nerdcore protohypster only nailed it once sacredly,5.00,338
about the albums lyrical themes and composition have it hailed as the way ahead of its time predictive of societys obsession with technology and the isolation and paranoia that comes with it yorke however explained that it stemmed mostly from his personal experiences traveling nonstop in a touring band the paranoia i felt at the time was much more related to how people related to each other but i was using the terminology of technology to express it everything i was writing was actually a way of trying to reconnect with other human beings when you are always in transit that is what i had to write about because that is what was going on which in itself instilled a kind of loneliness and disconnection,5.00,708
this is regarded as one of the best albums of all time and it is not hard to see why its themes are more present in our society today than they ever where when the album was released thom yorks vocals are chilling and beautiful all at the same time and the guitars and synths all work together incredibly well for the duration of the album with a very futuristic feel to the whole record none the tracks feel out of place but they all sound unique my only gripe would be electioneering falls short from the quality of the rest of the tracks high points  paranoid android no suprises airbag low point  electioneering,4.50,615
edit while my opinion on this album has not changed overtime this review goes against all review writing philosophies i have developed overtime this is my first radiohead record which was long overdue however it had to happen at one point to start off i really loved the vocals on this record along with some of the songwriting metaphors on tracks like lucky where vocals are very well expressed and drive the song these traits really pop out i did not really care much for the overall theme of the record of a dystopian robot ruled world but it fleshes itself out pretty well the instrumentals are kind of whatever for me it is just some pretty typical alternative rock music on the song electioneering the whole track sounds very classical in it is composition but i really appreciated it with the singers vocals one of the more standout tracks and my favourite personally is exit music for a film which is really stripped back but progresses into something a lot more i believe it highlights all of the best parts of this record quite aptly all in all this is pretty solid but this guy needs a band creative as he is i think,2.50,1127
i feel like this album has a weird paradox surrounding it it feels as if this is an album where if you dislike it people can just say you do not like it because you are trying to be a contrarian imagine not liking ok computer it is so good how could you not like it however if you like it you are just following the crowd what a pathetic sheep so basically having an opinion on this album the 1 album on this website is just a total waste of time chances are if you say you dislike this album then you are like me you do not actually dislike the album you just do not think it is as good as it is rated to be that is all it boils down to for me of course this album has good moments it can be exciting and emotional within the same track and that is quite impressive it sounds better than the bends which probably is not too difficult but credit where credit is due i always go into an album hoping to like the music because that only means more music for me and by mathematical means i do like this album it is over a 5 so i like it but not enough to listen to it often i went into this being convinced that on previous listens i thought it was really good but tonight after listening to it again i find myself quite disappointed that i did not like it as much as i thought i would ideas got weirdly repetitive quickly within and across tracks i found myself thinking some of the tracks sounded a bit too similar just sad altrock songs my biggest issue is that it all sounds way too serious when the sound absolutely does not warrant the tone electioneering is probably the only song where it sounds as if they had fun making it even though the entire album has the same instrumentals i am not sure how they achieved that but they did in my eyes they did anyway regardless of my opinions on the bends and pablo honey at least they were fun musically this album is quite a bit better than both but it could have been better if it was not so as it is oh well guess it is 1 for a reason rating  7510,3.50,1997
cold atmosphere of the songs combined with thom yorkes falsetto sounds too unlikable and sharp like a knife especially in paranoid android luckily he does not in that range often some of the lyrics are quirky but i have gotten used to them even with these problems the songs are still emotional greatly produced and gorgeous worst song exit music for a film,3.00,357
is it the best album ever no no such thing exists however this is very very very good the first 6 tracks are all exceptional  especially let down and karma police no surprises and lucky carry what would have been a more uninteresting second half,4.50,245
i love this album amazing song topics and great writing i love the instrumentation the flow of this album is great i get so much vivid imagery from it this album is incredible 1010,5.00,180
ok computer is rightfully so hailed as not only radioheads shining masterpiece but one of rock musics best records as a whole the album shows futuristic themes of dependence on technology depersonalization and social conformity these themes are explored masterfully through 12 tracks that stand as very predictive for a record created in 1997 the album kicks off with airbag a song that tells the story of the bands frontman thom yorke getting into a car crash with his girlfriend in 1987 his girlfriend suffered whiplash but thom walked away relatively unharmed thom uses this story to create a theme of technological dependence as well as to create a dilemma regarding the car in the story it was the car that got him into the crash but it was the car that saved him thom in the song has just survived the crash and is being hit with a wave of relief and euphoria he believes he can do anything in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe regarding the songs musicality it is one of the albums brighter happier songs it is carried by strong guitar and strings the bass only appears occasionally but is powerful when it does overall a great way to begin the record and a fun introduction to this landscape airbag is followed by the albums magnum opus paranoid android a multistaged ballad of paranoia and confusion the lyrics were inspired an experience in a bar where thom was surrounded by people who were high on cocaine the lyrics display thoms distain for society when i am king you will be first against the wall with your opinion which is of no consequence the song is separated into 4 sections reminiscent of queens bohemian rhapsody the first section is driven by acoustic guitar and haunting vocals with an ethereal and spacey vibe the second section brings in more electric guitar with a brilliantly chaotic solo this leads into the third section a time for thoms vocals to really shine as he repeats rain down rain down come on rain down on me the song concludes with another chaotic guitar part truly a masterful experience subterranean homesick alien is a beautiful song written about the struggles of feeling alienated from society the song detains thoms desire to escape his earthly stress and have a moment of bliss he uses the metaphor of being abducted by aliens take me on board their beautiful ship show me the world as i would love to see it it is a perfect song to mellow out with after the chaos of paranoid android the haunting beautiful guitar carries the song and gives it the otherworldly feel it has exit music is a large change in tone from the previous songs being a melancholic reflection on starcrossed love the song was written for a film adaptation of romeo and juliet and the lyrics make sense in this context thom explains the story of romeo and juliet and their chance for romantic escape unfortunately those who know the story know that it sadly does not work out now we are one in everlasting peace exit music starts out quiet and subtle but slowly builds into a very strong ending with thoms vocals at the forefront after exit musics gloomy build up we get hit with a breath of fresh air in let down my personal favorite song on the record in the track thom explains his struggles with keeping up with the stress of constant traveling transport motorways and tram lines starting and then stopping taking off and landing thom wants to bypass the waiting cramped spaces and boring travel one day i am going to grow wings the guitar at the beginning of the song is a perfect balance to exit musics sad piano the sweet blends of instrumentation on let down transport you some place else a world where we do not have to feel bogged down by constant travel a world where we can just be free the song concludes with a duet between an acoustic guitar and electronic beeping that feeds perfectly into karma police karma police which is arguably the biggest single off ok computer is a great reflection on how the idea of karma can be abused it sees thom call out certain people and call for the karma police to catch them by the end thom realizes that this action in itself can because karma to catch up to him with his repetition of for a minute there i lost myself the song is driven by acoustic guitar and piano however on the intro it is taken over by a loud demanding electronic sound that closes out the track perfectly the interlude fitter happier starts the second half of the album with a melancholy piano part in the background of a robotic voice explaining the ideal human situation in the future a sad fake world of repressed emotion this leads directly into electioneering a riff driven exciting peace about political corruption while not really fitting too well with the rest of the album it is still a great song to really rock out to something rare on this album climbing up the walls is a truly creepy song inspired by a time thom worked at a metal institution the song explores themes of mental illness or really anything that inescapable but subtle and either way you turn i will be there thoms vocal distortion the faded drums strange noises and strings really help to make this a very haunting piece the song starts to build around the 3 minute mark reaches a climax then deconstructs itself into an ambient soundscape before fading away completely one of my favorite songs on the album and truly brilliant another huge shift in tone comes with the lullaby sounding no surprises which explains what it is like to live in poverty and be a cog in society it explores how this live is slowly breaking thom down which is expressed in the music video with the helmet slowly being filled up with water the song beautifully blends the sounds of many instruments to create a sweet melody that masks the depressing vocals it is beautifully sad lucky which was the first song ever recorded for ok computer is about an ordinary person stepping up to the roll of a hero and having that raise his ego the head of state had called for me by name but i do not have time for him i personally think this is probably the most underrated song on the album jonnys guitar work on the chorus encapsulates the uplifting theme of the song finally the album closes with the tourist a slow finisher that really rounds out the sound of the album and leaves you feeling satisfied it is sadly one of the weakest songs on the record in my opinion in conclusion ok computer is an album that will stand the test of time and will continue to inspire rock artists to this day,5.00,6507
the singles were amazing but i never have the urge to just listen to the entire thing some of the deep cuts are kind of boring i think they got alot better at making ambiance sound exciting on kid a like i feel like a 2000s era radiohead would have made let down sound so much more interesting or literally half the tracklist for that,3.50,334
it is ok computer if it is indeed overrated and overplayed then it got that way for a reason it is seriously that good it is really an imaginative and visceral album it is very hard to actually sit down and talk about ok computer it is very hard to discuss any revered or classic album because it is obscured by rhetoric on both sides to admirers and fanatics it is the greatest album of all time to detractors and reactionaries it is the worst album of all time even the grey area is split on this album with some people reasoning it is overrated and a few even suggesting it is underrated there is no consensus on this album even though it has had various accolades bestowed upon it since the day it come out whether or not it deserves this position is of no interest to me whatsoever i mean how about we listen to the actual music just forget all about audience reaction and take this album to its bare essentials what we have is an album that is at times highly enjoyable and incredibly difficult to get into i would argue it is a more difficult album to get into than their followup kid a it takes the guitar rock sound of the previous albums and pushes it to its logical conclusion at points this album pushes beyond guitar rock incorporating elements of ambient music progressive rock not nearly to the extent as others suggest though kraut rock and even jazz what we get is a mix of so many influences that one cannot really call ok computer an original album however that criticism is as old as the hills if you are going to make your music sound like your influences make sure you do it the best out of anyone else this is what radiohead did with ok computer that first side  i cannot exactly put it into words the first six tracks of this twelve track album are all of the same quality are all retained and are all nothing short of fantastic i will not go too much into track by track but considering the opening two tracks are so closely linked it is worth talking about them as if they were one airbag opens the album and the cutup drums at once synthetic but also containing a human quality drive the rhythms as well as the occasional bass the atmospheric guitars intertwined  one for rhythm one for lead and another for lead though more experimental make this track a great one from the opening guitar attacks to the duel solos between greenwood and obrien in the midst of all of this we get thom yorke yes he is whiny at times however whilst it annoyed me on the bends here it is perfect i mean given the song is about being born again after a crash with a fast german car would not you be then again this is not pity but catharsis he is invigorated by the experience and the adrenaline he is amazed he is survived he likens it to an interstellar burst and feels that he is come back to save the universe this is a rather odd reaction to a car crash but the sensation the rush is all too real for the narrator to comprehend it the same narrator throughout all of the songs if so the hero of airbag is now a paranoid android this song is the longest on the album but is also the busiest it is cut into quarters essentially the opening section contains latin american style percussion over rather unwinding minor chords on an acoustic guitar with guitars coming in and out as they please yorkes vocals are full of anguish wanting the listener to stop the noisei am trying to get some rest it is at times aggressive almost subtly when he reckons when i am kingyou will be first against the wall this anger is then fully let out in the explosive second section with all guitars coming in the drums switching from a modest shuffle to an allout alternative rock assault there is even some 78 time signature magic and a guitar solo that is more of a freakout than anything moments like the third section of paranoid android are so mesmerizing and so beautiful that it is very difficult to comprehend them i mean this slower part of ok computer repeats itself on tracks like exit music for a film or lucky or the tourist the synths add as a choir amidst harmonizing vocal overdubs yorkes repetition of rain down on mefrom a great height the way his voice rises and falls over the other voices it is truly mesmerizing the final part of this section builds up over the rather macabre additions of pigs skin yuppies networking the panicthe vomit after a snide god loves his children yeaaah the second loud section is replayed blowing the song out of the water sound effects are added the sound of someone drowning screaming and random vocals over another guitar solo before the track switches off this first side places two great tracks together let down and karma police we will get to sub and exit later the former track is a seldom performed yet beautifully melodic gem with vocal harmonies arpeggiated guitars and video game like keys in the middle eight the drums are pounding almost tribal in places but the lyrics  oh my god those lyrics at once they are miserable and monotonous but altogether incredibly beautiful how can a chorus consisting of being crushed like a bug in the ground be souplifting how on earth can this album be depressing when the music is so anthemic so lifeaffirming maybe that is the message or the concept of the album that even if you want to grow wings it would be a chemical reaction anyway meaning you have to face your problems without any intervention from a higher being at least that is how i interpret these lyrics karma police is the best track on this album hands down it lives and breathes ok computer its lyrics of arresting those who talk in mathbuzzes like a fridge or women with hitler hairdos are incredibly indicative of how politics  both on the left and the right  essentially focuses a lot of its time on trivial matters the chorus over sexy sadies piano and acoustic guitar  this is what you getwhen you mess with us  is at once threatening and sweet the verses with the stomp of the drums over said piano and guitar  the occasional backing vocals that sound so distant and far away  also have an ongoing threat to them the second verses pleading its backtracking the narrator giving all he can but it is not enoughwe are still on the payroll shows a reliance on money over his personal desires sounds like he is going to break down right wrong the ending bridge of for a minute therei lost myself the shift to b minor  but still with major chords  changes the entire tone of the song either the narrator has learnt the error of his ways or has sidestepped his feelings of guilt to still participate as a member of the karma police the ambiguity has little time for questions for within a few bars guitar feedback enters the song the song ends in a nightmarish fashion with the feedback unwinding exploding oh and fitter happier and electioneering are by no means weak tracks fitter happier is essentially the manifesto of the album it details the views expressed within over what appears to be microsoft sam it cuts away from images of children smiling in the backseat to flushing spiders down the plughole all over electronic noise and guitar feedback the ending a pig in a cage on antibiotics suggests dehumanisation leading right into electioneering which is the rockiest number on here the lyrics as overtly political as they are are very snide take the mention of voodoo economics or the inclusion of i trust i can rely on your vote the chorus too over the trio of guitars of when i go forwardsyou go backwardsand somewhere we will meet shows at once an honesty of the distance between politicians and the public and a sarcastic solution or optimism over the whole thing it is alienation speaking of alienation is a major theme of this album why else would the protagonist of subterranean homesick alien want to live up above where aliens hover why else would he wish that they would swoop down to take him on board their beautiful ship he feels alienated by his peers who never believe me who would be shut away yet feels alrighti am just uptight the music that accompanies the narrative acts out the fantasy  space rock pitchshifted guitars twinkling keyboards and rather plodding drums the chorus seems to explode this fantasy to reveal his insecurities of the world around him the world that is not the one he wants it continues on no surprises a bitter ode to the ideal life so to speak the ironic use of twinkling xylophone against arpeggios and acoustic guitar over lyrics which profess to wanting to end life via a handshake of carbon monoxide the narrator is tired of drama he wants no alarms and no surprises but previously expressed a desire to bring down the government losing his heart maybe the job that slowly kills has slowly killed him too the lyrics are also distressing my final fitmy final bellyache and at once hopeful such a pretty houseand such a pretty garden over the final chorus backing vocals sing get me out of here this life of peace is not for him he feels like he had no choice what other choice do the protagonists on exit music have they must leave before all hell breaks loose and must travel in the cold singing songs to keep us warm the sombre first verse a simple acoustic guitar then turns into a bridge section with a keyboard the second verse has a weird effect on it that sounds like a city street before the drums come in suddenly distorted bass dominates the mix over reverb and delay heavy tremolopicked guitars yorkes tale takes a new turn you can laugha spineless laugh is this towards his lover or his detractors either way the hope that your rules and wisdom choke you is dark it is a darkness on par with unknown pleasures the ending ends the same as romeo and juliet we are onein everlasting peace in their death their dying wish is we hope that you choke before the song dies down you can tell radiohead like pixies because loudquietloud dynamics are everywhere on this album paranoid android exit music to name a few however climbing up the walls is the noisiest and creepiest song on the album this one really is scary not contrived scary or theatrical fear this is genuine terror the distorted vocals softly sung over industrial drums and distorted bass sing about being the key in the lock in your housethat keeps your toys in the basement it is all paranoia to the nth degree being a reflection or being everywhere you turnopen up your skulli will be there the second verse drumming wise transfers onto the ride cymbal adding flourishes of a crescendo strings appear in the choruses but are more prominent in the second chorus electric guitar can be heard too and the lyrics become more obscure to understand  fifteen skulls to the back of your head i have got the smell of a local manwho is got the loneliest feeling  before a massive interlude over an echoey clarinet  solo when thom comes back to sing the song title a few more times dissonant strings join him over a final scream the songs insect noises and strings die down lucky is also fond of this sort of structure starting with obrien playing on the nut of his guitar yorke enters over the ride cymbal with i am on a rollthis timei feel my luck could change his guitar is scratchy and the bass is full of motion the scenes of a plane crash unfold over lead guitar  his wish for sarah to kill him again with love have been met  as he is pulled out of the air crashof the lakecoz i am your superhero the instruments back out save for yorke and his guitar intoning we are standing on the edge the addition of choir like keyboards on the second verse creates a rather heavenly feel over thoms refusal to listen to the head of state he repeats that it is going to be a glorious day almost sarcastically but something tells me the protagonist takes the air crash as a source of pride the outro which again builds things up gradually adding guitars the music becoming more aggressive before a closing repetition of the chorus and we are standing on the edge the song segways into the album closer the tourist and it is a great album closer because it gives the listener a chance to slow down after what has happened thus far the rather jazzy calm instrumentation over peter green style albatross slide guitars contrast with the lyrics of more alienation being singled out by a dog that barks at noone else but melike it is seen a ghost so is the narrator literally a tourist or a tourist going into the afterlife the heavenly synths in the chorus of hey man slow downidiot slow down seems to suggest both the mentions of sparks or a thousand feet per second seems to reckon back to album opener airbag in fact the chorus could be an exclamation inviting either the narrator himself or the other driver to slow down the closing guitar solo uplifts the song before all dies down except for a little triangle ping theories exist that the last two tracks of ok computer link back to airbag and then the album goes around in circles i support this theory ok computer is one of my favourite albums of all time it encompasses a range of styles and influences creates thoughtprovoking lyrics and showcases a knack for writing pop songs within a more complicated framework i do not care what poll it is on whether it be among the greatest albums of all time or the most overrated albums of all time i personally enjoy it and i find something new with every listen stay fit and happy and whatever you do turn it all the way up,5.00,13391
look this album is amazing but it are not no my beautiful dark twisted fantasy or my personal radiohead favourite in rainbows but i guess it is ok i originally rated this album a 7 when i was a massive loser now at age 15 i am even more of a loser giving me a sole reason to gave this album a perfect score of 10 on this album first off let down is my 2nd favourite radiohead song of all time up there with how to disappear completely fake plastic trees and weird fishes  arpeggi the instrumentals on here are probably the most satisfying and sustaining compared to every other radiohead and i would still say thom yorke is incredible on this album but he is better on the other radiohead favourites i place above this album depression is a gift though thom yorke predicted the future on how computers and technology would not only save our planet but would be our definite downfall,5.00,882
radiohead who did not succeed with their first studio album pablo honey in 1993 but signaled that they will be one of the biggest rock bands of the future with the bends in 1995 and ok computer in 1997 made songs that sometimes translate our feelings in our personal space and remind us that we live in a society according to most critics radiohaed is one of the greatest rock bands ever with thom yorkes excellent songwriting and vocals jonny greenwoods unique guitar ed obriens back vocals and guitars that create an incredible atmosphere in songs and phil selways harmony in the band and again according to many critics the best album of this rock band is ok computer maybe even the best album ever made the most important factors in the writing of this album are the environment created by modernism and the enslavement of people one of the most fundamental results of neoliberalism at the end of the 20th century written with a kind of postmodernist movement this album mostly depicts the crisis people experience from the mouth of a real person or from a third point of view there is a passive rebellion against the role of the individual in society and the system that carries out this role in the firstperson song in the songs told with a divine perspective the relationship between individual and society is examined thom yorke did not use clear language while writing these songs so the songs make us think the album is also a perfect album musically the album contains many elements from experimental parts in some tracks to pieces that guitars are not used extensively like no surprises in this way emotion transformations are very intense within the album and the album is musically fluent for example many critics think that paranoid android contains 3 separate songs in addition different environments created in some intermediate transitions add a different flavor to the album for example the song subterranean homesick alien which tells the story of a man who forgets the meaning of life can take you into space in an instant and make you watch the world from a spaceship as promised in the song sometimes you listen to songs on the album that push you to face your personal feelings and while you listen to these songs sometimes you get hopeful sometimes you admit that there is no exit from the current situation and you are helplessly silent sometimes the narrator suggests that you should do the behavior that the system ideally shows you of course this narrative is made with a critical point of view in the song the narrators voice represents a sort of industrial world this album which includes excitement fear despair sadness and rebellion in general was written as a postmodernist rebellion to the industrial world by the end of the 20th century this album is a masterpiece that claims to be the greatest album ever both musically and in terms of lyrics and it is perhaps the most important thing that brought radiohead to where it is now this album also has a very important place for me emotionally and it is my favorite album thank you so much to radiohead for presenting this album to us ,5.00,3119
i liked it a lot but no best album ever made is a bit of a stretch i think i prefer wish you were here or court even but i can definetly see the appeal its like a modern beatlesfloyd album without too much of the prog elements or pshycadelic rock that the beatles were famous for its got its own thing and you got to respect that even though for me its not my favorite a lot of songs are ballads with heavy music which for me made the album a little stretched basically that the songs were simply taking up run time it also did not help that i had to search up genius and youtube videos on what the album was about lol thanks middle 8 but no i did not think the album is a 10 or anything more like a 710,4.00,703
i say this alot ok computer is the best album created by man a bit if an over praise honestly but i mean it a friend of mine once said ok computer is the best album to ever exist period it deserves to be put in a time capsule and launched into space before humans ruin the planet and it is lost forever a statement that i completely agree on it may make you feel suicidal or it may make you feel free for me this album is so important because of what i think of when i listen when i listen to this album i feel like i do not have a care in the world i sit back and become one with the masterpiece thoughts of dying do not come to me i think of how lucky i am to exist at the same time of such a great album i want to dance in the rain dramatically close myself away disappear completely but still live to see another day tommrrow where i might go to a family function or i might play games with friends but when the time comes again i will be back to where i belong my place the quiet place of my own sanctuary i hate to talk like i am some experienced old person but i am frankly upset that most of my generation does not see radiohead as an elite band with depressing lyrics that hit the soul but i am also upset that i do you see this conversation is unrelated to radiohead so i will spare you that you see i have not really made an effort to show me peers this album which does not give me much of a right to complain about people not knowing it maybe if i make an effort to enlighten others things can be good anyways that is the rundown of ok computer written by a 14 year old girl that grew up too fast,5.00,1609
when radiohead released ok computer in 1997 they renewed and put a new spirit in rock music at the time making one of the highest praised albums to ever be made trough thom yorkes amazing vocal ability and the bands beautiful instrumentation we get the first real masterpiece they released filled with astonoshing looming but beautiful songs dealing with themes such as the isolation that has come too the world trough technology the treath technology brings to us all and the state of the modern world ok computer is probably radioheads strongest album conceptually though it is very close the album is filled with thoms amazing lyrics and ability to tell stories with the prime example being paranoid android dealing heavily with paranoia anxiety and loneliness in the world that is changing very fast into a technological age it does this perfectly like the whole album does one of my favorite moments on it is no surprises the heavy guitar riffs and instrumentation are gone and all that is left is a stripped down extremely beautiful song that just makes you think for minute the album ends on the tourist an amazing outro finishing of the album perfectly by recognizing how fast the world is declining and thom asking it to slow down this album is praised as the best albums of all time on multiple websites and online communities though it is not for me it is still a masterpiece that is worthy of all the praise it receives,4.00,1431
ok computer is just one of those albums you can completely understand its position on this list when thinking about absolute musical perfection which is a rarity this is one of the albums that first come to mind with such amazing instrumentation and vocals as well as a captivating concept and the unnatural prediction it gave for the modern world its quite easy to see why this is one of the greatest albums ever solidifying radiohead as one of the greats,5.00,456
oh boy it is the big one as someone who was a big radiohead fan in my early years of high school this was unsurprisingly a staple of my musical listening back then while i have moved past my short phase of disdain for this album and i do have a favorable opinion of it now i cannot say i was particularly blown away here sure tracks like airbag and fitter happier are absolute wonders but a lot of this just feels like the bends but more inspired this serves it is place in music history and music culture particularly online but i cannot say i view this as the shining gem of music as a whole that many do i will say though this album begins the trend of radioheads strongest asset being their great sense of atmosphere woven into every release something that would then be elaborated on in a much more fulfilling manner just a few short years later,3.50,850
most people do not know or understand what is necessary to record a classic album it is not only having good songs it is about the cohesion that is maintained between the tracks definitely ok computer is one of the great achievements of humanity  an album that speaks precisely of humanity in technological times other great works such as blade runner had already spoken of this but it was not until ok computer that we were able to have an auditory record on this subject recording an album like ok computer is a huge job that from what i have read led radiohead to collapse and no wonder you cannot record something like ok computer without spending your life on it every piece of the album is pure perfection even fittier happier that surely influenced works like fight club i cannot figure out how they could record this album and that is what makes great works we have in the top 10 of rym albums by pink floyd loveless by mbv and the beatles a good album is not just the songs it is the recording the concept the performance the vision of the artists and definitely ok computer is one of the great albums of our time,5.00,1122
the first time i heard a radiohead song i was still a kid browsing throgh the tv somehow i ended up watching the paranoid android clip and it was just stuck with me i could not take my head anywhere else the animation was so beautiful and strange to me specially the axe scene some years later i found what it was all about and this year i listened carefully to all the songs i can say for sure that this is one of the best albums out there,5.00,440
thom yorkes shining moment as a vocalist for his entire career is here on climbing up the walls where after a whole bunch of buildup leading into the final chorus he just fucking screams his lungs out in a final piece of catharsis those 3 seconds may be the most impactful any radiohead song has ever been the albums p good too even if the second half is a bunch of good songs that drag because they all sound like albumending tracks,4.00,433
ok computer is the third studio album released by english alternative rock band radiohead the album was released on 21st may 1997 by parlophone records and capitol records depending on the region the album was produced by radiohead along with now long time collaborator nigel godrich who would go on to produce every other radiohead album since ok computer the album was recorded over the 8 month period of july 1996  march 1997 with the exception of the track lucky which was recorded on 4th september 1995 the album was recorded mainly in st catherines court near bath in somerset and clocks in at 53 minutes and 21 seconds in september of 1995 radiohead were commissioned to take part in the help album a charity album from war child in support of victims mainly of the ongoing war in bosnia which would end in december of that year with the death toll standing at around 100000 the song the radiohead contributed was lucky which would later find its way onto ok computer finding themselves tired after extensive touring for the bends the band decided to take a break in january 1996 returning to the studio to demo tracks for their next album after a few months in the studio radiohead headed out on a 13 show long tour in america on this tour radiohead were asked by director baz luhrmann to contribute a song to the soundtrack of his upcoming adaptation of william shakespeares classic romantic tragedy romeo and juliet thom yorke told humo magazine that when we saw the scene where claire danes juliet holds the colt 45 to against her head we started working on the song immediately the song they created was the aptly titled exit music for a film which plays over the films end credits the song was kept off of the films soundtrack but would as with lucky find its way onto ok computer the band started recording the album proper in july 1996 mainly at st catherines court in somerset the bend were not contempt with just continuing the commercial sound of pablo honey and the bends with ed obrien telling q magazine in 2003 that everyone said you will sell six or seven million copies if you bring out the bends pt2 and we are like we will kick against that and do the opposite the albums music was inspired by artists like miles davis elvis costello  rem with lyrics inspired by the political writings of anarchosyndicalist  libetarian socialist noam chomsky among other things thom told melody maker on this album the outside world became all there was i am just taking polaroids of things moving too fast some recurring themes of the album are technology modern life  the future the title of the album comes from the 1978 radio adaptation of hitchhikers guide to the galaxy which the band listened to on their 1996 american tour thom said the title refers to embracing the future it refers to being terrified of the future our future of everyone elses other considered titles were ones and zeroes  your home is at risk if you do not keep up payments the albums artwork was done by thom credited as white chocolate farm and seasoned radiohead collaborator stanley donwood the artwork shares the same apocalyptic feel as the album a result of donwood trying to make something the colour of bleached bone the first track on the album is airbag a song inspired by a car accident thom got in in the 80s with his life being saved by an airbag this theme had already been visited by radiohead on their 1995 high and dry  planet telex bside killer cars which spoilers is a better song unfortunately radiohead decided to open up ok computer with the weakest track not that it is bad or anything just not to the degree of quality of the rest of the record the song is however a success at setting the atmosphere for the record with the introduction of the idea of the danger of new scary technology like cars i guess the song also refrences reincarnation with the lyric an airbag saved my life coming from a magazine article thom read 810 next up is the inequitable classic paranoid android thom wrote the lyrics after an unpleasant night in a bar in los angeles where he saw a woman react violently to having a drink spilt on her imagery that is replicated in the songs music video he is quoted as saying that paranoid android is about the dullest fucking people on earth the great title serves as the albums second reference to the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy coming from the character marvin the paranoid android the track provides a great example of thoms trademark falsetto vocals structurally the track is comparable to queens bohemian rhapsody starting relatively slow and light before moving into a sonic youth sounding guitar rock sound and then moving into the angelic bridge speaking of i really like the bridge it showcases some of thoms best lyricism creating a vivid image of an apocalyptic hellscape unfolding before your eyes 910 track 3 is subterranean homesick alien a song about a narrator who wishes to be abducted by aliens in order to escape his dull life the track was inspired by an assignment thom received while still at school where he had to write martian poetry with a title that references the 1965 bob dylan song subterranean homesick blues the track features brilliant reverb guitar and drum rolls that well represent the feeling of alienation as well as giving the track a fitting empty space like feel i particularly enjoy the use of a pause in the line they shut me away but i am alright 910 track 4 is exit music for a film which does in fact serve as the exit music to a film with that film being baz luhrmans 1996 shakespeare adaptation romeo  juliet the song itself takes inspiration from the classic tragedy with thom telling select in july 1997 i saw the zefferelli version when i was 13 and i cried my eyes out because i could not understand why the morning after they shagged they did not just run away it is a song for two people who should just run away before all the bad stuff starts the track features atmospheric guitar paired with an almost unsettling closeness with the vocals the choral vocals that are brought in as the chorus starts give a warm apocalyptic feel an atmosphere that is furthered in verse 2 with the inclusion of unintelligible sounds in the background the song then bursts out with the addition of drums then heavily distorted guitar and then bass before once again fading away with thom giving out some frail sounding we hope that you chokes 1010 next up is track 5 let down a song that to me at least has always sounded like a love song apparently according to thom about that thing you get when you are in transit but you are not in control of it which i guess makes sense that quote now that i think about it just reminds me of the bit in father ted where a smiling father kevin is sitting on the bus and the driver puts on the radio and lo and behold an acoustic version of exit music for a film starts playing causing father kevin to rapidly fall into a depressive state great stuff shame one of the creators is a massive transphobe though anyway back to radiohead the song on the surface seems more straightforward than the previous tracks but as with most radiohead songs nothing is as simple as it seems jonnys guitar is playing at a different time signature to everyone elses instruments helping to create a phil spectoresque wall of sound one line that particularly stands out as summarises thoms attitude to himself and life throughout the record is hysterical and useless 910 track 6 is karma police a pleading song about the idea that you will never be happy in a capitalist society under your boss thumb the title and lyrics come from an inside joke from the bends tour jonny said in an interview in may 1997 whenever someone was behaving in a particularly shitty way we would say the karma police will catch up with you sooner or later the heavy drums and bass hit create a dark rhythm that gives you the feeling of being dragged away by the police the line about the hitler hairdo still catches me off guard even after listening to it so many times i like the piano in the chorus that pairs well with some almost bowieesque vocals from thom 910 fitter happier track 7 thom yorke told melody maker that fitter happier is the most upsetting thing that i have ever written i cannot say i completely agree but it is definitely up there fitter happier creates a vivid image of a desolate sterile society where everyone is fitter happier the track features chilling haunting piano paired with vocals done by fred one of the synthesised voices from the macintosh application simple text furthering this feel is the use of musique concrte with audio from the 1975 political thriller three days of the condor i always used to skip this song but it has since become one of my favourites 1010 next up is track 8 electioneering probably the most overtly political track on the album being inspired by the poll tax riots of 310390 as well as noam chomskys analysis of contemporary mass media under the propaganda model from his 1988 book manufacturing consent i suppose i should probably explain the poll tax riots the poll tax or to give it its formal name the community charge was introduced by margaret thatcher in scotland in 1989 and in england and wales in 1990 the poll tax placed a single flatrate percapita tax on every adult in a household this ended up harming those who were less welloff i wonder if the tories knew that was going to happen eh leading to the riots of 31st march 1990 which led to 339 arrests the poll tax was abolished in 1991 and was replaced by the council tax in 1993 onto the song it stands out on the album as having a heavier noise rock sound with great drumming that creates the feeling of a riot thom described the track as a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones 910 track 9 is called climbing up the walls and features lyrics about thoms time as an orderly in a psychiatric ward hospital it was also inspired by krzysztof pendereckis modern classical composition threnody to the victims of hiroshima which just to add an additional fun fact is sampled in the heavenly version of manic street preachers track you love us the song provides a chilling piece like the audio version of a horror movie aided by thoms vocals which remain in his high register throughout the track the strings also kind of make it sound like a bond theme i think the reviewer from select magazine puts it better than i ever could thoms voice dissolving in a fearful bloodclotted scream as jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo 910 next up is no surprises and i am just going to cut the bullshit and say as of today as i write this at 1028pm on thursday 10th december 2020 that this is my favourite radiohead song the way the guitar just cuts through the atmosphere the overall sound the lyrics perfect all that and it was somehow recorded in one take apparently radiohead strove to replicate louis armstrongs 1967 classic what a wonderful world which is a job well done in my mind though a more overtly desolate version the song also replicates as thom put it a fuckedup nursery rhyme no surprises runs parallel in my mind to the song this is yesterday by manic street preachers from their 1994 magnum opus the holy bible both tracks have a downtrodden yet somehow upbeat sounds as well as similar lyrical themes see such a pretty house and such a pretty garden from no surprises and houses as ruins and gardens as weeds from this is yesterday beautiful song 1010 track 11 is lucky which had previously been released on the 1995 help compilation from war child the song is inspired by the ongoing in 1995 it had ended by 1997 bosnian war which was an extremely brutal conflict with horrendous war crimes being committed mainly by the yugoslavia supported serbia the majority of proceeds from the help compilation going to those affected by the bosnian war when you remove this context the songs lyrics sound ominous and almost evil lyrics like kill me sarah i feel my luck could change it is going to be a glorious day really exemplify this feeling 910 next up is track 12 the tourist a song about tourists thom saw rushing around france jonny was the main writer of the songs music drawing inspiration from the same place thom did for the lyrics this track feels like a closing track even from its start which was one of jonnys main aims the song has really nice guitar peaceful to start but begins to build up it kind of feels like you are being shot into space 910 final score 92100 capitol records considered the album to be commercial suicide but nevertheless along with parlophone launched a large marketing campaign which included print advertisements adverts in tube stations in london tshirts an fm radio in the shape of a computer very clever boys a floppy disk with radiohead screensaver how cutting edge 1000 cassette players with promo tapes of the album stuck in these marketing efforts proved successful as the album debuted at 1 in the uk and 21 in the us the album sold 136000 copies in the uk in its first week going on to become the best selling album of 1997 in the uk ok computer has sold 78 million copies to date making it radioheads best selling album the against demons tour began in barcelona on 220597 the band went across the uk ireland continental europe north america japan  oceania the tour concluded on 180498 in new york thom told mojo in august 2003 that was a year too long i was the first person to tire of it then six months later everyone in the band was saying it then six months after that nobody was talking anymore ok computer received universal acclaim from critics and was nominated for album of the year at the 1998 grammys but lost to time out of mind by bob dylan it won the grammy for best alternative album it was also nominated for best british album at the 1998 brit awards and was shortlisted for a mercury prize thom said of the albums reception in 2007 what really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create the album is preserved in the national recording registry of the library of congress as of 2014,5.00,14188
the bends was for most people the record that defined the sound of radiohead a blend of a deeply emotional presadcore structure and intense and aggressive postgrunge the album was both a commercial but critical success which gave the band the chance to do absolutely anything recorded alone in a haunted mansion ok computer was a enormous change in sound and ideas leaving traditional song structures the band experiments with more free and complex structures reminiscent of the old progrock eras the little bleeps of effects from the bends become huge walls of sound with clear but very well used postrock and shoegaze influences radioheads openers are always otherworldly painting the first impressions of the atmosphere and sounds to come in the record airbag is a cluster of intensity and alienation under airy guitars and a mix of organic and machine drums it is energetic yet melancholic with a slightly odd atmosphere and is probably the most dense track on the album and definitely a notable piece from their discography after four beeps at the end the complex progrock ish guitardriven insanity of paranoid android is a slap on the face being probably their longest song almost 7 minutes it is divided in 3 parts and they are all very various but very completive too the connection both musically and thematically of those truly proves a step forward in maturity for the band without any transition subterranean homesick alien a heavily reverberated and otherworldly song incorporates some of the more jazzy harmonies and weird filters in favor of an exceptional emotional intensity exit music for a film calms down the previous tracks agitation with a quiet dark and haunting song the structure and tension it creates is a breathtaking and incredibly powerful in its climax it is a cathartic experience and recalls the crescendo structure from of the postrock genre let down uses multiple layers of guitar to create an unique wall of sound of complex harmonies and rhythms the progression in this track leads to a huge and intense climax the song is what would be the foundation of later pieces from the band in the second half of the album electioneering is the most straightforward guitardriven track here the absolute craziness of the bends added with accusing political lyrics just works very well with the record climbing up the wallss distortion and aggressive effects climb to complete insanity the summit is rough incredibly wide with notably the string section inspired by pendereckis atonal writing this track is horrifying and extremely memorable in no surprises the band calms down everything with an oddly desesperated lullaby probably one of their prettier song sonically yet quite dark lyrically lucky and the tourist close the album beautifully with a breathtaking emotional intensity these tracks are unbelievably smooth and colorful it is then obvious that the album has a very clear message to pass ok computer attacks that preinternet world with a fear of a world overwhelmed by technology and continuous information the reason why each songs are so different is that each of the tracks describe a particular character of society the interlude track fitter happier shows that very explicitly a computercontrolled artificial voice tells what seems to be advices but quickly becoming paranoid and terrifying every song in there are very unique and almost perfect in their own way from the despair of exit music for a film to the terrifying agony of climbing up the walls or the emotional intensity of the tourist overall the result is satisfying and seems meaningful  ok computer is one of those perfect albums that never ceases to amaze me in how great the production musicianship and songwriting in this are not only being flawless this record is quite inpactful in its meaning and is a big twist from the bends really pushing forward guitar music as what postrock or shoegaze did but here with an exceptional musicality masterpiece from my instagram page kiddae,4.50,3992
this is a hard one to rate this album plus many other works by radiohead defined my teen years and was a foundation for a lot of my music taste in order to properly rate this though i need to take the nostalgia bias out and that is difficult for me the other bias i feel i need to take out is how hard it is been shilled by the media over the years and on this site as well at the time of writing it is the 1 album of all time and does not look like it is going to move still listening to this album again i cannot help but sing along in my opinion this is a transitional album from their angst and pep of their previous era starting to mold into their more moody and experimental output to come later unfortunately this leads to me having some confusion upon listening to this album again it is hard to tell what this album wants to be is it singersongwriter rock or is it experimental art rock i just cannot seem to see the contents here as a single entity instead it feels like a tugofwar i will focus on the songwriting first there are some extremely good moments of awesome here paranoid android still an awesome song but there are also some times where i feel like the songwriting is empty and only there to create a product more of their poppier structured songs however i do not feel there is any inherently bad songs on here i think that likely contributes heavily to the current site rating some of these songs rock out so hard then there is the experimentation a lot of it feels like it was just placed on to be alternative or weird and i ate that up when i was a teenager but these days it just feels like a mundane distraction fitter happier is a pretty decent idea but is so depressing compared to the rest of the album that it does not seem to fit so well with me i also have some miscellaneous thoughts  i have a personal hatred for instruments being panned hard to one side sorry but i dock any album for this  phil selways drumming is incredibly underrated  i am so incredibly desensitized by this album due to me playing it so much as a teenager most songs just do not hit it for me anymore as i think my taste has changed a lot paranoid android is my absolute favorite here it was one of my favorites when i was younger and still is so awesome to me i am going to give this a 4star i think that is the best i can give it edit i dropped this to a 35 i think it is essential to the genre but it is not my thing,3.50,2428
there are few top 100 albums of all time lists by internet sites or magazines that do not include radioheads ok computer often in the top 10 and sometimes even at 1 ok computer has not been touched by me for several years despite me knowing about its existence and how universally acclaimed it was there are some reasons for that but all of them are bad eventually you could say it comes down to 15year old me being an elitist punk and metalcore fan who would reject everything that is different i remember asking somebody once why are all the albums that critics love bad and thinking that radiohead was about the highest stage of pretentiousness so that was me and maybe if it had not been for my friend heather that would still be me she almost forced me to listen to ok computer and after some weeks of not really wanting to i gave in first i fell in love with no surprises and karma police i did not really get the rest of the album but it had a certain fascination i listened to it again soon after when karma police happened to become the defining soundtrack in my life during the time of my proposal to my now fiance now it seemed to make more sense to me and i liked it so much that i immediately ordered the cd on several occasions i picked up the cd again and grew to love song after song the beautiful guitars in lucky the amazing bridge of paranoid android then exit music for a film after watching black mirror shut up and dance now i do not think i would be able to tell why this album is so often considered the best album of all time i just know that in a way when i listen to it i feel it this album has become an emotional rollercoaster for me i do not even need to think about the lyrics though they are great and exit music for a film fills me with melancholy possibly the musically saddest song i have ever heard the wonderful atmosphere of the tourist has me hooked until the last second of the album ok computer is pretty much perfect and is a wonderful collage of different soundscapes and emotions held together by thom yorkes beautiful voice and jonny greenwoods stunning guitar sounds now if i would go back and tell 16year old me that one day ok computer will be one of my favourite albums i would probably tell myself to piss off highlights lucky karma police exit music for a film,5.00,2311
i definitely get why ok computer is objectively the greatest album of alltime 1 on rym i think vocally this is radioheads best album tracks like airbag paranoid android and the tourist exemplify that best from a lyrical perspective this album is frightening because most of us agree with what the album is saying it shows themes of the future of technology paranoia and isolation there are a great selection of singles on here that were not shy on the charts paranoid android might be my favorite song on here as the song transitions from a more calm to aggressive periods it eventually leads up to a very melancholic part of the song where the humming and vocals are soothing let down sounds like it heavily influenced the 2000s altrock scene i do like the song but do not think it is as great as people make it up to be karma police samples a beatles song sexy sadie and makes great use of the sample it is probably the most accessible song on the album and an amazing tune i would say that i think there is a roadblock in ok computer that would be electioneering which is usually agreed as the lowest quality song on ok computer and climbing up the walls which is probably my least favorite song if i had to pick one i do think that both songs are still great though the album ends beautifully with the tourist the song has an amazing vocal performance beautiful hook nice guitarwork and a great sense of finality for the roller coaster of emotions you just went through,5.00,1473
amazing album but it is not the best album ever made in fact i prefer kid a or in rainbows,4.00,90
two days ago i decided to click on a video about this album it talked about how the band went from an afterthought of the grunge era to becoming one of the most critically acclaimed bands of all time i was really interested and decided to listen to the album the next day yesterday so that i could listen to it properly and hear the story that this album tells the album tells a story of a world overrun by automation and business and people struggling to catch up with technology the whole album is based off of these ideas the songs tell of different things happening to the human race like in paranoid android where everyone becomes more animalistic and less like people or climbing up the walls being about the growing paranoia in the population there is one thing about this album that kind of makes it difficult to get and that is the vocals i seem to get lost on them and i found myself having to look some of the lyrics up to fully understand them that is all overall this album is a pretty good and accessible postrock album that i could see myself listening to every once in a while it is abstract it is bleak and it is emotional,4.50,1139
radioheads ok computer is a tightly packed beautiful and extremely influential record that changed the worlds idea of what music could sound like i do not have a lot to add that has not already been said thom york is a great vocalist the compositions here are insanely well done and chock full of different musical passages and progressions its themes are consistent and interesting everything here combines into a near  perfect experience this album has some of my favorite radiohead songs still paranoid androids multiple musical ideas make for a consistenly ear catching and engaging listen and exit music for a film is as dramatic and alluring as it is title implies i do feel like the very cold tone of the record can put some people off the moody  gritty sound of the record does not make for any great party music or anything but it fits the album very well and is absolutely lovely if you are able to get past it is pretty dark and intense exterior electioneering falls into the trap of being too cold and uninteresting to be enjoyable for me honestly the angry and speedy sound is great but it never goes anywhere interesting with it fitter happier is a off  putting track at first glance but after looking through the lyrics and ideas of the record the impersonal sterile robotic speaking  unsettling atmosphere make complete sense and is one of the most mind  opening song on the whole record after multiple decades of being out ok computer is still an awesome listen and it is ability to engage with the listener and get them to experience its themes and stories unfold as each song builds on the one previous is almost unmatched to this day number rating 9  10 fave tracks airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police fitter happier climbing up the walls no surprises lucky the tourist least fave tracks electioneering,4.50,1882
i cannot listen to this anymore it makes my stomach boil every song is a depressing mockup of sincerity drenched in false platitudes about the rustling intermediacy of modern life and its foibles the burrowing antiquities undersold inside the brain field of diametric openings cannot be ignored thom yorkes voice is the voice of a foolish wizard in the farmhouse we hear the song but no reverberations paranoid android is okay,0.50,426
this is so boring his vocals are horribly whiny and the songs just drag into nowhere,2.00,84
yyeah this album totally sucks guys rright i am totally original and hip for disagreeing with the majority of people on a site populated by hipsters i am a free thinker unlike most of you i am now going to post about this on a cambogian basketweaving forum i found on instagram wwhat i am not insecure about my music taste worst album ever made period,4.00,351
perhaps this is the most influential album since the dsotm in the world of music and undoubtedly marks a watershed in terms of alternative rock although a bit loaded with the depressive and melancholy the songs it has in this sense are excellent karma police no surprises lucky the tourist and subterranean homesick alien and yet that also has moments of great intensity in songs like the epic paranoid android or the incredible airbag and  or climbing up the walls simply a wonderful job and which to date remains an unquestionable benchmark,5.00,542
what an amazing experience radiohead was allways on my mind but they really got on my to lisen list when i started going to this site and saw this as the best album of all time so i was really surprised but i knew this band would not make me fell the same things as the beatles or queen so this album would have to be really really good so that i would love to lisen to this a lot of times it was close the album is great but as the descriptors says it all anxious pessimistic depressive are not my style and rarelly get the 5 starswith rare exceptionsbut this album is that a bit because of the lyrics and i dont consentrate much on that the album has amazing sorrene quitar work and instrumentasion in general and some great roching tracks and some hins of pink floyd in lucky my favorite track is subterranean homesick alien with its calm atmosphere and i love thoughfullnes of the album is such a mind jouney and fitter happier what a song what a piece so interresting the piano work the hole aura and the spine chilling robot voice and some ways this track reminds me of revolution 9 from the beatles and they compare a lot radiohead and the beatles now i get it i am really interrested in this band fantastic album not number 1 not my favorite,4.50,1249
a smashing effort on radioheads behalf ok computer proves to labels that experimental music can too be popular and celebrated in the commercial sense structurewise the album cradles the listener through worlds and dimensions of isolation alienation and troubles of fitting in as an appropriate touch on the albums closer the tourist thom yorke pleads the listener to slow down a climactic and downtempo end,3.50,406
after toasterqueen12 finally pushed me to listen to an actually good piece of music for once i have now listened to ok computer ok computer is a pretty solid release that shines for me in it is second half but i see really growing on me with multiple listens when i started the first track the whole thing was pretty sudden to me i have never listened to any alt rock projects really and if i have they probably were not good but this one just hit me like a bus i was like do i like this is this going to click with me and at karma police it sure as hell did the production on that song is crazy and thom yorkes vocals work well over it as well it just got better after that and i really enjoyed it the first half was good but it did not click but that second half really did i feel with multiple listens i will love this album more and more i can really understand why this is considered such an influential and great piece of art overall a very good release that will grow on me with more listens 85100 best tracks karma police climbing up the walls no surprises lucky worst tracks airbag,4.50,1090
i have never liked this one as much as kid a or even the bends for that matter in over a decade of listening i have never been able to quite put my finger on what it is about the album that puts me off but if i took a stab i would suggest it is its occasional overproduction likely intentional icecold aesthetic halfbaked incorporation of looped samples and the very 90s shittalker ver 12esque robot that and i can no longer stand the eternally overplayed karma police and no surprises still i am glad ok computer stressed out thom enough that the band went on to create masterpiece kid a and there are a lot of beautiful moments and elements here that would inspire much of their later work airbag let down and the tourist are my somewhat unpopular picks 35 stars  good,3.50,770
the first time i listened to this i was partly pleased and partly underwhelmed i had listened to kid a before this so this ended up feeling like a midpoint between the two surrounding albums i preferred i do still consider it such but after a few listens this managed to grow on me the first three tracks are some of radioheads finest carrying a psychedelic feel that you can properly immerse yourself in those happen to be the best three but tracks like let down electioneering climbing up the walls and no suprises keep the listener interested there are quite a lot of influences to the eclecticism here and it is important to note that  radiohead did not just create all these styles off the cuff they just managed to bring them all together nicely no need to recommend this given its popularity already and perhaps not the album but worth the time from my perspective best song subterranean homesick alien,4.50,909
weakest songs are at the end still a 10 this is like losing yourself in the ocean at night no shores in sight the ice cold water surrounding your whole body but most importantly doing it willingly it is every bit as deeply pessimistic as it is absolutely beautiful,5.00,264
ok computer has stated itself as one of the best albums of modern music and of course the best in radioheads discography even still after more than 20 years of its release it expresses perfectly humanitys lovehate relationship with technology,4.50,242
it is practically impossible to write about radioheads third album without addressing the massive amount of acclaim and hype spawned from its mere existence by the time of its release various critics and publications were already hailing it as an instant classic and were calling the band the beatles of our generation that is quite a commendation and on the surface it seems true after all both are english rock bands whose hit singles garnered them international fame and whose successful albums proved highly inspiring to countless artists of their generation many of whom tried to imitate their style meanwhile the band continued to experiment beyond their comfort zone and change up their sound amidst growing divisive opinions but going beyond mere surface comparisons shows that the two groups are nothing alike at all the beatles primarily wrote cheery catchy almost simplistic rock songs about love and happiness alongside some fantastic covers of classic rb tunes while radiohead are known for creating selfpity anthems and artrock songs about anxiety fear fatalism and other equally depressing themes also the beatles had each of the four members singing competently at some point and generally on their own song while radiohead are almost always reduced to one singer who is overly angstridden vocal performance often becomes too much to take in why do i harp on this point so much well it shows to my satisfaction just how unsophisticated and dronelike the consensus surrounding radiohead is ironic given their album that seeks to preach against such feebleminded conformity and represents part of why i find the constant comparisons made between the two bands and to radiohead albums in general highly insufferable seriously when i see reviews on this site that compare older albums to pablo honey dylans selftitled debut or amnesiac rolling stones tattoo you i question why i even bother trying to skillfully articulate my opinions it is obvious that dreary albums like ok computer appeal to the majority of the ryms demographic and i can understand why radioheads artrock influences lend an atmospheric quality to the music that evokes the most famous film soundtracks which when combined with yorkes sorrowful voice resonates with the lonely depressive largely online types but as a hardcore fan of songform and traditional tunes i find much of the album lacking enough engrossing sounds and interesting lyrics to justify its vapid pink floyd imitations to make my perspective on ok computer as clear as possible i will compose a trackbytrack analysis of my thoughts while listening intently to the album airbag i actually enjoy this opening track quite a bit the flowing guitar riffs and dj shadow inspired drum delay succeed at establishing a somewhat inspiring mood right out of the gate i also like how the structure of the lyrics help the songs pacing along nicely thom yorke is certainly not the greatest rock singer in the world but i will say his agonized voice delivers the message competently enough for the song to work i am not as fond of the ending with it is mundane background textures in place of engaging instrumentation but it is not a dealbreaker paranoid android a huge step down from the effective opener this 6andahalfminutelong track is a tedious mess of horrible lyrics dreadful vocals and obnoxious distortion effects that fail to earn the comparisons to the classic rock anthems bohemian rhapsody and happiness is a warm gun the song starts off fine enough but only gets worse as it goes along with yorkes vocals morphing into the kind of whiny adolescent pitch that made the bends such a laborious record to sit through and with his lyrics devolving into artsy babble that reads like he wrote them while drunk or sleepdeprived and never bothered to edit it after the fact the unconventional structure only serves to make the music seem very unorganized and at times jarring and the end result is very unsatisfying to listen to but my biggest problem is that i just do not sympathize with yorkes cynical disposition nor do i get much from his angsty vocal performance apparently yorke claims the title of the song is a joke and that the phrase with your opinionwhich is of no consequence at all is one as well and he is right it is a joke i just do not find it funny at all subterranean homesick alien a homage to the classic dylan tune in name only this somber and moody track is one of the more entertaining parts of the album mainly because yorkes vocals are kept in check here and the guitars are consistently melodic in terms of lyrical ability thom remains rather blunt and uncreative  they are alluptightuptightuptightuptightuptightuptight goes the chorus it is worth noting that the second verse ends with i am alrightalright before reverting back to the chorus with i am justuptight which i guess is his way of proving he is somewhat selfaware i think my biggest disconnect from this album so far comes from my lack of relatability to yorkes everpresent theme of alienation as reflected in the way he so condescendingly embraces his kinship with these hypothetical aliens over his human companions exit music for a film a slower track which starts as a quiet acoustic guitar song then adds some eerie vocal chants as background texture before finally climaxing in a loud electronic wave of sound the tracks lyrical allusions to romeo and juliet feel largely unoriginal and the song itself feels a touch melodramatic in it is presentation but i guess it is transition from quiet to loud accomplishes what it sets out to do well enough that i cannot complain let down i love the arpeggio guitars and unique electronic rhythm and find yorkes emotional performance on this song his best yet but i have begun to grow weary from his predictable metaphors i am going to grow wingsa chemical reaction  it is a butterfly get it and his seldom compelling way of detailing his boredom with modern life and technology starting and then stoppingtaking off and landingthe emptiest of feelings  yes i have felt exhausted having to wait on transportation too thom karma police i have gone back and forth on this one initially hating it then kind of liking it and now i just feel very meh on it i find its noisy electronic coda incredibly annoying and feel like yorkes attempt to imitate fascist funhating censors make him sound as hollow and robotic as the people he is mocking i also do not really feel anything from its deliberate deadbeat drumming other than a constant source of tedium not terrible but also not captivating in the slightest fitter happier in case paranoid android subterranean homesick alien and karma police have not already drilled the idea of humansbecomingalienatedduetoaroboticcompliancewiththenormalizedstandardofliving into your brain here comes this dreary monotonous overtly dystopian spokenword track to hammer the beyond understood point home electioneering the most abrasive guitar song on the album by far here is where they kind of sorta pretend to act political in a rather slapdash sendup of election interference and voodoo economics it is like someone read a book about politics and was fascinated by several buzzwords and phrases but could not figure out a way to write an intriguing song about the subject to contrast a superb example of a song that manages to convey its political message while remaining musically engaging is washington bullets by the clash the music itself might come across as a bit overblown and yorkes screechy vocals might feel like overkill but it does serve as a nice respite from the usual dreary nonsense climbing up the walls easily my least favorite track on the album featuring horrible production loud stale drums and a noisy assortment of effects including distorted vocals and ridiculous lyrics i have got the smell of a local manwho is got the loneliest feeling attempting to personify paranoia as well as fellow abstract concepts fear and anxiety in an embarrassing effort at writing a scary song and just to make things worse it has another obnoxious electronic ending one that sounds like several car horns layered on top of one another no surprisesthis calm simple melody feels like a relief after the disaster of the previous track the lyrics are more generic cynicism and fatalism that yorke seems to believe are incredibly compelling and deep but that i find shallow and pretentious at least the vocals are delivered clearly this time albeit in a more robotic tone of voice how ironic or is it intentional bring down the governmentthey do notthey do not speak for us may sound like a bold political statement but since in the context of the song it is just another fleeting thought in the mind of a suicidal depressive it hardly counts also such a pretty houseand such a pretty garden comes across as a meaningless jab at suburban housing and feels spiteful and bitter instead of relatable lucky the penultimate track and the first of two largely tepid closing songs that fail to arouse my interest a repeat of the neardeathexperiencemakingonefeelinvincible theme from the first track only presented in a much less captivating way maybe if the lyrics were more engrossing or at the very least not so full itself although again maybe that is the point and i just do not get it then i would like it more still i find it difficult to care about  much less relate to  yorkes disturbed personas even with the gloomy guitar riffs providing a steady pace the tourist the final track and what a bore it is with lukewarm rhythms and another uninspired chorus hey manslow downslow down which both add up to a dull finale to a mediocre album the music can hardly sustain my attention at this point and the vocals are nothing special that is not even to mention what passes up for stale background fodder in summary most of the album is competent musically but the aurally satisfying moments are brought down by banal lyrics subpar singing annoying distortion and dated electronic effects as i have stated i get why it appeals to so many on here the simplified and direct lyrics the electronicallyinfused artrock tracks the themes of isolation and paranoia even the desperately angstridden vocals all succeed at catering to the types of people who search for albums like ok computer to make their sorrows feel more relatable and real the point of this review is not to say that others are wrong for liking this album or even for believing it to be the greatest musical achievement in recent history i simply want to make it clear that my dissatisfaction with the album comes not from it is massive popularity or critical outpouring scornful as i may be of those who so routinely compare radiohead to other artists especially the beatles but rather from my disconnect with yorke and his ideas when i first heard the album i will admit i did relate to it more and thought i liked it enough to purchase it on itunes but i never saw it as the masterpiece the internet hyped it up as having discovered many more gratifying and more relatable albums since then i find little reason to return to ok computers constant air of doom and gloom thoms angst just comes across as immature and whiny and although tom verlaine does not have the nicest sounding voice either his songs are usually more fun and meaningful and not as pathetically morose i hope it is clear why i refuse to acknowledge this record as a classic or as a masterpiece and why it does little for me personally if anything i feel more confident in my opinion that radiohead albums in general are overhyped and that they are nowhere near the level of mastery and musical pleasure that the beatles possessed and i should not have to say this but it is only my opinion and i am no more correct than the countless reviews endlessly praising it are wrong,2.50,11813
years ago i reviewed this and coming back to it i realize now i did not have a good understanding of this one very impressive how they manage to be so experimental with the dark futuristic cold gloomy themes and atmosphere but make it sound so good and easy to listen to being a hip hop head i am very accustomed to being able to pick and choose songs from albums and be able to love them on their own if they were to be shuffled on a playlist but this album meshes so well together it gives the listener an unreal experience as a whole i get the hype a bit more now,4.50,566
in which radiohead reaches the natural conclusion of their 1990s evolution this might not be the best alternative rock album ever but it contains several of the best alternative rock songs ever and its only real mistake is ending its runtime with its two weakest songs which are still absolutely excellent one album ago they were among the bands defining the alternative sound on a really good but at times pedestrian album two albums ago they were squirting out hot shit it is obscenely impressive how fast and efficiently radiohead evolved what really makes this album so great is that it is the first and maybe even the only one in which each band member has massive influence on the sound and yet even with their own separate sensibilities every single idea on this album sounds like it came from the same obscenely talented person on pablo honey most of the music of the band was drowned out by overloud grunge guitar crunching on some of the best parts of the bends bass drums piano and less aggressive instrumentation and production provided a glimpse into some new layers of emotion and sound radiohead were capable of on this album there is not a track that does not contain bold and interesting drum and bass parts by phil selway and colin greenwood there are few tracks that do not contain gorgeous piano and keyboards most of the tracks contain elements of chris greenwoods growing interest in classical orchestration thom yorkes songwriting has reached its peak his vocal delivery the most believable desperate howl you have ever heard the members of the guitar trio have all found their placethis album contains mystifying effects guitar by ed obrien some of the best highenergy guitar solos i have ever heard by jonny greenwood especially on paranoid android and electioneering and incredibly evocative rhythm guitar by thom yorke the overbearing crunch of grunge giotar production has disappeared completely leaving bear for all to see a band of six supremely talented writermusicians firing on all cylinders and all in the exact same direction homing in on one of the best albums ever recorded like desperate deranged robots who have just discovered emotion and inspiration there is a lot of variety on this album not a single song sounds the same except maybe let down and no surprises but they all sound like they are supposed to be together thematically most of the songs explore burnout and the pressure of a young professionals life in the city yet i find it better not to think of this as a concept album exactly it does not seem to be organized that way and it does not need to be this is just an album of arternative rock perfection that happened to be made while its lyricist was feeling exhausted and using those feelings to great effect as i mentioned the albums only flop is ending with its two weakest songs lucky and the tourist both great songs neither have albumending energy with lucky having a good hook but being one of the least compositionally complex and instrumentally daring runtimes and with the tourist being aetherially mellow and less thematically intriguing than any of the first 10 songs were it not for this track listing snafu i could easily see the case for this being the best made album of all time and what does a good band do after recording such an album if they are truly great they do something totally different if they are truly great and legends they do something totally different that is nonetheless on the level of an album like this one radiohead are legends,4.00,3522
yep this is the big one whenever radiohead come up in discussion 9 times out of 10 it leads to talking about ok computer but does that make it the best radiohead album short answer no as important as this album is to me and to music generally climbing up the walls is pretty forgettable and fitter happier is sort of like an extended unnecessary interlude though i am a fan of electioneering this three track run on the second half sort of kills the momentum of the album that being said you cannot ignore the brilliance of this album as much as some people may want to even on those three weaker songs the production is immaculate and still feels completely timeless yet also as though it could have only come out in 1997 that is as close as i will come to bashing ok computer airbag paranoid android exit music for a film let down and no surprises are all perfect songs and would each be strong contenders to make a radiohead top 10 list that is without even mentioning the criminally underrated lucky and the previously underrated by me karma police my point is even though this is not my personal favourite radiohead album the songwriting here is the best it has ever been for the band with one of the most eerie and brooding atmospheres ever put to an album to boot though full marks may seem generous based on my comments this album is too important to me and to music today for me to give it any less i can look past the slight issues with pacing on the back half because this really does play like a bestof for the most part,5.00,1532
godoooo radioheads most powerful album i wish i could listen to it again as if it were the first time,5.00,101
the album that completely changed my taste in music as a freshman in hs in like 2011 i kind of became that guy that went against the grain i had many friends although i thought rap was kind of lame and that people my age just listened to it to seem cool i was narrow minded and as i fell in love with this album and radiohead i thought i had such good taste that was superior to others i do not even know why i ever brought them up because my friends would just go i cannot even name a song by them who are they or oh yeah creep is dope and the conversation would go nowhere i remember hearing exit music in a romeo and juliet movie in theater class and being like omg that is radiohead and people just being like who after getting into hip hop my junior year when i got a car i completely switched up my taste but did not hate on bands i had formerly listened to after i graduated college i went back to my roots and listening to this album again brought it all back i also had a different pov and resonated with the lyrics and the feelings of isolation anxiety hopelessness acceptance etc not a single song i do not like although exit music can vary in quality depending on my mood and of course fitter happier is what it is but i respect it in the context of the album i am giving it a 1010 because its my favorite album of all time and my gateway into experimental music the epitome of a timeless album,4.50,1406
i remember being really miserable at a camping site this one time and deciding to take myself on a walk along the dunes now this was pretty unprecedented a child and children do not voluntarily go on walks my parents were justifiably bewildered but i had a trick up my sleeve ok computer at the time i did not know it was considered by many to be the greatest or one of the greatest pieces of music ever made all i knew was the 5th track was really sad and i was a pretty miserable little fucker so i heard ok computer in it is entirety for the first time yeah the cracks are showing fitter happier and electioneering back to back is not the greatest look in the world but to be frank an album with so many songs that are this entwined with me cannot be anything less than a 10 and yeah lucky is better than about half the songs on here but i think that more speaks volumes about how many fantastic songs this band has written than anything else,5.00,945
it is really good make no mistake but do you ever play the sims and make an art goblin just so you can make extra money sometimes i like to make an incredibly ugly sim with loner and virtuoso traits usually in the arts build a room in the basement with a bed a toilet a shower an easel and a fridge and remove the door so they have no option other than to spend their torturous existence producing art for other peoples consumption it generates extra money and serves as an outlet for sadistic whims without actually harming anyone reader do you ever do that that is what i feel like thom yorke is but with music a music goblin there is no way a person who is not entombed in a doorless basement could have written exit music for a film,5.00,736
wow i do not get it at all how is this the 1 rated album on this site i would get something like in the court of the crimson king the dark side of the moon or to pimp a butterfly even loveless i could understand being 1 more than this but this no it sounds like a pretty standard alternative rock album to me with slight experimentation almost none of the riffs are interesting or creative thom yorkes vocals get on my nerves i do not like his weird vibrato and i do not particularly like his timbre i mean i did not expect to like this album but i did not expect to dislike it this much i also do not like how lethargic it is this album has very few moments of energy also one of my big issues with the album is just how gloomy it is and it is not that i do not like any sad music but this feels overly melancholic it is not the type of melancholy where you can feel the sadness of the artist but the type where it just sounds dull and tedious the whole thing just feels like a slog to get through as for positives airbag had a cool intro riff and paranoid android has a cool riff at 222 the verses of karma police are not bad and there are other elements of a few songs that are decent but overall this is not made for me at all and while i can somewhat see the appeal in it even accounting for the fact that lyrically this album tackled some unique issues and dictated the style of british rock for the next decade i do not get the massive praise it is gotten on this site,1.50,1475
i am not really sure why this album is the 1 rated album on the website i mean yeah this album was pretty cool at the time i guess i had the cd back then for my sony discman and i guess i enjoyed it more than their other first halfdozen albums but at the end of the day this is basically just 90s altrock ok sure it is a weird proginfluenced offshoot of 90s altrock but i do not think this album has aged tremendously well contrast this against in rainbows which never expects to age and ok computer is neither as catchy nor as deep as the flaming lips masterpiece the soft bulletin from about the same period so i cannot elevate this beyond the level of a pretty good 35 highlights paranoid android this song is a bit uneven however with the eerie acoustic first half dominating the abrasive electric second half the slowburning climactic exit music for a film the catchy karma police i am going to their signature song over creep the avantgarde jazzy climbing up the walls no track on this album has grown on me more over time than this one and the onetwo gut punch at the end lucky  the tourist so that is a fair number of highlights at the end of the day this is a good album  i would say my 2nd favorite radiohead album overall but thom yorkes shrill voice has always grated on my eardrums and large sections of this album are just abrasive and ugly take airbag for instance i guess this is supposed to be a fan favorite but it is possibly my least favorite track on the album after you throw out fitter happier if not the overly jangly electioneering actually yeah i think electioneering is worse  unlistenable i just think the guitar intro to airbag is ugly and thom yorkes vocals are decidedly whiny on this track it kind of reminds me of fake plastic trees which is not only the worst radiohead song i have ever heard but probably in my top three most hated songs of alltime even one of my favorite tracks climbing up the walls has that awful 30 seconds of distortion at the end of the track so i am not really a fan in rainbows is way better having fewer weak tracks and a more pleasant sound aesthetic overall,3.00,2120
i remember seeing radiohead videos on mtv in the mornings before school anxiously waiting for the lyrics i want a perfect body i want a perfect soul to make me feel ok not being ok not being cool than i saw the time in which true love waits would finally be studio recorded and true love waits in haunted attics and true love lives on lollipops and crisps those lyrics reminding us of the horrific places love lingers in our minds and why it is important why we can never become strong enough to not let love hurt us again years and years after love appears to have lost its relevance finally learning that it cannot keep us safe from the bunkers of war but somehow that does not really matter because it exists on lollipops and crisps like some kind of literal fairy tale but we are not here to talk about those songs i stole ok computer it was my first radiohead album i was in the fits of active addiction a friend of many years said i could borrow it i was homeless i had a sony discman though i played this record nonstop it was terrifying but i never gave it back i would never get the chance to either i did tell her i took it she told me the album was written with me in mind i deserved it it was mine the cacophonous thundering of paranoid android sounded like my brain after returning from iraq i felt so much like that paranoid android the karma police were coming to get me for my crimes against humanity why i did it was hauntingly familiar in fitter happier no surprises has a surreal effect making me ok with whatever is coming down the pipe i would later learn that after ok computer was released radiohead went on tour and all of their equipment was stolen everything in it is right place tuned and orchestrated to it is precise calibration stowed cared for and untouched none of the equipment could be easily replaced they had to cancel the tour because everything was tuned to everything else and so difficult to match computers synths guitars wires and robot machinery bill gates probably could not figure it out i suppose that is similar to my abduction of the record from abby in this age their is a line from our hearts to our minds that can only be connected by radiohead ok computer is only one of the albums that tells us this,5.00,2252
this album is ok definitely do not think it is the best album of all time it feels so selfserious at times but the biggest issue for me is that there is almost nothing on it to really excite me not bad by any means but i do not think it deserves all the acclaim it has,2.50,268
airbag really nice hopeful sounding intro track that twist at the end is nice too maybe a bit samey throughout the whole song but it is not that bad 910 paranoid android so great so so great starts off really mysterious and cold turns into a rock banger takes a sad bridge and ends with a banger again fabulous the bridge is a tad streched out though 9810 subterranean homesick alien another great track introoutro riff sounds cool and it is refreshing to hear just a fun song after the monster that is paranoid android i like it a lot a little more than airbag too 9310 exit music for a film really cold at the beginning and the end is justseriously bonechilling and beautiful i wish the guitars were louder in the beginning and the ending just a bit longer because i just wanted that feeling a little more 9110 let down man this track is kind of a let down to me it is not a bad song by any means i just do not think it is on par with the rest of the album the melody just is not that interesting thoms vocals get really good at the end though and the electronic boops in the middle were not bad either 710 karma police this is like the third sad song in a row so the intro might bore you but it is a really catchy punchy song the chorus is haunting but pretty with the piano and the end is also really nice and catchy as you get to hear thom shoutsinging 9210 fitter happier really cool disturbing and cold interlude with this monotone robot voice over some creepy sounds and effects sets an interesting atmosphere it could be shorter though 910 for an interlude electioneering god i love this track so much it is so packed with these absolute bangers of guitar riffs it is so fun throughout i do not even care if it sounds samey it is just that fun i know it is wrong but 1010 climbing on the walls probably the creepiest song not including fitter happier the effect on thoms voice is so cool and that instrumental bridge is fuckin nuts his scream at the end too god damn 9410 no surprises to me this is like the better version of let down more intriguing lead melody has more cool sounds and bits throughout it is also a nice change of pace after two straight bangers 9510 lucky holy moly another banger that guitar at the chorus is too damn good the bridge is amazing and the final bang is fantastic too 9910 the tourist pretty good for a final song starts kind of slow for me but that ending is so mesmerizing your brain just floats off into another dimension 9110,4.50,2471
i wonder why,2.00,12
christgaus review of sgt peppers lonely hearts club band perfectly describes my view of this album a dozen songs good and true perhaps they are a little too precisely performed but i cannot complain well there is a little more to it than that unlike sgt pepper which has very little connecting the songs ok computer is more thematically and musically consistent expressing a very specific kind of millennial angst which has aged very well the eclecticism feels very wellbalanced never veering off into excess nor being unable to sustain the entire experience the songs themselves all good though the second half is a definite step down unlike latterday radiohead thom is actually interested in writing coherent melodies which lose a bit of their potency being delivered by his nighincomprehensible caterwaul some of which actually end up foregrounding themselves let down the way i talk about this album sounds like i hate it but that is not true at all each song has something unique to offer and though the lyricism is vague it is radiohead after all it does not slip into laziness anywhere near as much as their latter projects sometimes even being quite compelling there is too many flaws for a higher grade but too many great songs to justify dropping the score below an 810 the best thing radiohead ever did and though it is not the only good thing it is definitely their most consistent effort overall,4.00,1408
radiohead are probably the one band that has changed the most within my conscious over these past years of musical exploration exploitation and reinvestment i have gone from hating just about every album they have made to loving every single album the band has released more than any other except for one yes this is a review of that one album that one album happens to be what has been hailed as the greatest album of the last two decades by literally thousands of critics and fans alike so why do not i enjoy this what is there to blame well the reasons are lost i do not know why i never knew why i cannot really say that it is this bands smugness that turns me off i managed to completely love the bends for months upon months without ever catching on to how horribly pretentious and annoying it was it is not the acclaim either though i adored amnesiac for being a mistake album i also absolutely loved kid a which falsifies both of these reasons likelihood it is not the art rock atmosphere that this provides as in rainbows is an absolutely glorious piece it is not even that i prefer their more electronic side pablo honey has gained love for being simplistic i still enjoy every album in some shape or form as well so it is not as if i have grown out of any of them it is more that the albums reflect a place and time in life and i think that ok computer expresses my complete ignorance within the vast universe of musical landscapes and monuments i did not understand the album upon first listen hell how was i supposed to it is completely alien to my mind circa 2007 i had no idea who radiohead were or why everybody loved them so much i had not heard any of those enormous art rock names the velvet underground king crimson david bowie i only actually knew radiohead by how everyone else my age knew them creep of course i listened to pablo honey first this is the time where i loved the album most i listened to the bends and already felt that they were growing as a band and at the time that was a scary idea i mean here is this 13 year old kid that loved black sabbath when they played paranoid acdc when they played with bon scott metallica when they had cliff change was scary and i hated ok computer because of this but what was weird was that i did not hate the later albums as much kid a made me feel smart amnesiac made me feel dumb hail to the thief reminded me of the bends so i went back and listened to that a few more times and ended up replacing pablo honey as my favorite album by radiohead and with time i really did manage to warm up to a few songs from this album mostly thanks to the guidance of fellow rym members let down quickly rose as being my favorite song of all time i was reading through reviews of this album on day and saw someone the name escapes me noting the absolute angelical of a keyboard arpeggio in let down naturally i went and investigated not remembering anything of the sort before and my mind was blown i actually paid attention to what was happening in this album and discovered why people thought it to be so great i tried doing so with other songs but that proved to be more difficult i set it aside once more but decided to investigate kid as tracks as well i was blown away once more i will fastforward past my amnesiac days which i believe are aptly covered within my review of that album already we will send myself to the present actually what i am listening to right now airbag has revealed itself recently as being a cornerstone a connecting link between the predecessor and the successor between the bends and ok computer the guitars feature the same crashingly raw and unrestrained power behind the likes of the bends and my iron lung but also have sonic experimentation that radiohead had begun to explore throughout this album not only that but the drumming is much more dynamic and exciting to hear now the tones are not quite the electronic bang and clang that kid a is stuffed to the brim with but is more of a contemporary style with that electronic overdub slipped in just for fun thoms vocals took on their new nowfamiliar delicate tonality the frailness and openness that makes radiohead a brilliant band the worth that airbag has as an opener has finally been revealed to me and really what keeps me coming back to this album time after time and leaving me disappointed more and more not because it is a bad song of course not that is ridiculous paranoid android has long since become my choice as the greatest song this band has ever conjured the guitars and drums ripple and intermix so effortlessly and frighteningly that the atmosphere rivals that of the complex and deep ambiance that kid a drowns in so easily paranoid android is pretty awesome need it even be said thoms vocals reach all the highs you can imagine and still manage to graze the edges of the lows paranoid android proves thom yorkes worth as a vocalist completely and then all the buildup near the middle always leaves me wondering when thoms going to explode and then it just happens the guitar reverts to the most primal moment of radioheads entire career and then the tremolo picking to bust open the solo maintains its position as my favorite part of any radiohead song in comes the eerie ambient moaning the aesthetics of the song shift so suddenly and violently that this new atmosphere is frighteningly alien and abstract which segues very nicely into the next song on this journey subterranean homesick alien pays homage to bob dylan of course but is nothing like bob dylan in actuality bob dylans severely oldfashioned and guitardriven it is hard to imagine that anything in this song is guitar at all it is all very electronic and different from your runofthemill rock music the guitar tone does rear its head eventually but its sound is still very much enveloped in this new and different sound something radiohead have not ever truly done before now this song has always been difficult for me but now it has managed to force me to actually hold back tears of joy that is a truly rare quality of music and radiohead take another sharp turn exit music for a film is entirely somber and sulky sulk never even got like this street spirit fade out still had a sense of pop optimism within itself but this is just drainingly depressive just one of those songs that just sit staring at your music player stunned silenced kind of gives you the chills maybe the soundscape is much more subtle this time around as well or thoms voice is just far more prominent the lyrics are impossibly hard to decipher on the first go or even the twentieth there exists a sense of deprivation and loss within them but the actual cohesion of language is lost in thoms tortured performance and delivery of them let down returns to familiarity and comfort a sort of breather from these heavyset and revolutionary rounds of songs bright twanging guitars and a bit more uptempo thom vocal deliveries an identifiable refrain as well and the drums have fallen back into a relative state of simplicity the soundscapes have fallen away and have become once more little more than a wall of guitars let down has a soothing quality to it if anything a mellowing chillout song the existence of that arpeggio is almost lost within the lulling waves of guitar lapping before it comes right up and hits you with its miraculous beauty 330 in if you are as curious as i was when i first took a listen now for the puzzling song that proceeded subterranean homesick alien the song i never understood the acclaim and love of the striking piano introduction being blasted into the background by the bass drum which accompanies the vocals arrival as well kaaaaarmaaa poooliiice arrest this maaan he talks in maths those subtle choral vocals during the refrain and how absolutely dissolved and exposed thoms voice presents itself here as the song signifies its ending with that nowfamiliar drone of electronic experimentation it acts as a forewarning to what is to come possibly the strangest song radiohead ever released fitter happier is hard to follow and thoroughly robotic and heartless going from such an aggressive onslaught of emotional waterfalls and tidal waves hearing the drone and monotone of a robots voice is completely alienating and scary the calming return of an airbagesque guitar twang is a refresher the sleigh bells give way to the cowbells and the guitars peak in their distortion and thoms voice introduces itself again here though thom is donning a different mask one more of political frustration and rage rather than what has always been a calm if mournful demeanor his vocals begin to swirl around quickly and become something of wonder and awe where this sheer unrestrained power goes by the next song will forever remain a mystery climbing up the walls codas exit music for a film as well as subterranean homesick alien with both being brilliant songs that approach the same branch of musical mindset and aesthetic it is no surprise that climbing up the walls is the song that hits every right note that is legitimately beautiful in how barren and deserted everything about the sound feels the solemn pounding drums along with the contrastingly weakened guitar electronic and thom tones the doublelayering vocals one featuring yorkes normal range that high falsetto with an absolutely different and distant lowranging set of vocals in addition to that the creeping waning electronic soundscaping fits into your mind the idea of something grasping onto life just barely alive striving to be more nothing more majestic truly exists for radiohead acoustic strumming provides the soundscape for once with the electronic soundscape instead moving into the foreground providing that twinkling chimes of no surprises thom almost seems to be singing backwards it is a strange world that thom is in while singing this only truly being able to coherently pronounce the chorus of no surprises it is a tearjerking ballad truly then silence then screaming then i want to run i want to ruuuuuuuun scraping soundscape fills the void of emptiness just enough to be eerie the flick of acoustic guitar enters in followed by a set of electric guitar distortion which all just preludes the track opening up and being the full roomfilling sound that creeps up only routinely the sounds quickly fall back into the silence only the buildup has taken root everything is more powerful anticipation builds for the return of that power and lucky cannot help but sound like a more adventurous creep strip away the acoustic guitar that creep replace it with a solitary electronic sound then take away the heavily distorted chorus and add in that roombreaking sound what have you now lucky a reinvention of the past but a proof that radiohead truly did care about pablo honey and what it did and now the final song the closer this has always been the hardest song for me to comprehend the tourist is scores of peoples favorite song from here or one of their favorites but if not for fitter happier i think i would pick the tourist as the weakest song here it does not quite hit home as hard as lucky and does not have the buildup and release of it either the tourist is more a meeting of the two words of songs like lucky and songs like exit music for a film it is pretty but uninteresting at the same time almost a confused sound a sound that radiohead finally will discover and capitalize three years following yes kid a if this even need be said ok computer has finally opened up its petals has finally revealed the sweet nectar of lust and glory that every music critic has given it and appraised it for the circle has been completed from pablo honey to the bends to kid a to in rainbows to amnesiac to hail to the thief and finally to ok computer the torch has been passed to its final holder where it goes from here i do not know nor do i care,3.00,11862
honestly every song on this album is perfect not including fitter happier front to back this album will always hold up i cannot pick a favorite it is too difficult to thoms delivers some of the most amazing vocals i have ever heard on certain tracks such as climbing up the walls favorite tracks exit music for a film electioneering and climbing up the walls least favorite track the tourist the tourist is a great track but it is a very slow paced end to such an amazing album,3.50,477
a lot of really cool ideas drowned in a sea of mediocre soft rock balladry and awful vocals,2.00,91
most of the songs in the album are nothing special and rather dull but the over all mood of the song is rather atmospheric and depressing definitely not worthy of being 1 even in its own genre but the only reason its a 3 from me is because there are much worse albums out there,2.50,277
in 1993 radiohead released pablo honey an average rockgrunge album that was not anything special in 1995 they released the bends which was easily superior to pablo honey and a huge step up for the band little did they know when writing ok computer the album they would release in 1997 they would change music while the bends took the boundaries of music and stretched them ok computer just straight up disregarded them it is the sound this album created that became a strong influence on many other artists i felt it fitting to open up this review in a similar manner to my review on the bends because the jump from pablo honey to ok computer was unlike we had seen in almost any other band in only 4 years they went from being that creep band that some people know about but have only heard a couple songs from at most to one of the greatest bands of all time the first aspect of the album that should be noted is how grim and dark it is from the very first guitar on airbag to the final ding on the tourist the album portrays alienation anxiety and dread in some cases the instrumentals themselves are enough to sell this point on my personal favorite track on the album climbing up the walls the dark instrumentals and anxious string arrangements all lead up to one final explosion as if the song is screaming out in horror and pain with guitars and strings and all other tracks however follow the very radioheadish tradition of pretending to be ok or even joyful when in reality that is far from the truth no surprises sounds pleasant with its calm and almost refreshing guitars and instrumentals but when you look at the lyrics you will see that it seems to represent giving up and in a rather depressing way too meanwhile the interlude fitter happier involves a mechanical voice speaking over some dreary dreadful and somber piano it describes the ideal citizen someone who is fitter happier more productive etc whereas it seems obvious after some time that this is not how life should truly be as ideal citizens all different copies of seemingly the same person they are living a lie when living like that there is no way to truly be happy subterranean homesick alien meanwhile takes a slight break from these dark and paranoid themes and instead focuses on alienation through echoey guitars and soft drums it explains this feeling of homesickness and loneliness the instrumentals on this album are stunning the nervousbutopen atmosphere of the tracks is very well achieved and in a different way with each track songs like exit music and climbing up the walls start off slow or quiet but you can tell from the get go that something is not right over the course of the tracks they build to a climax full of energy and then fade back out quietly as if mute whispers are all that remain of them exit music is one of the most anxious tracks whereas climbing up the walls is downright horrifying meanwhile the masterpiece of an epic that is paranoid android has multiple different sections all packed into one song movements that flow and fit together it also includes some of jonnys best guitar freakouts and still follows through with the paranoid atmospherethus why the songs name is extremely fitting electioneering is more straightforward and does not really settle well with most but i quite like it it is driven on strongly by immense energy and loud powerful guitars as well as some excellent riffs in the ending portion of the song the distorted drums and varying guitars on airbag add a unique atmosphere to it that opens the album perfectly with electronic noises and airy guitars mixed with a heavier distorted beat paired with electric guitars let down is another track that seems happy but is actually quite grim it really helps to drive home the point of a false sense of security with its joyful drums and pleasant guitar a cunning mask for its truly sullen lyrics meanwhile karma police represents how unique people who do not follow everyone else in their way of livingperhaps the way of living described in fitter happier are treated poorly and how individuality is hard to keep the pairing of guitar and piano makes for a great aesthetic lucky has some evident pink floyd influence and it makes for one hell of a track the calm eerie quiet of the first verse leading into the chorus with thom belting out the lyrics as guitars scream and swell behind him is sublime and pairing the song with the tourist to close the album works perfectly the tourist itself is an amazing song slow and quiet until the chorus explodes with energy it is as if the song is desperately screaming for everyone to slow down the final guitar riffs are once again perfectly fitting for the song and sound marvelous these two songs help ok computer go out with a bang of epic proportions an ending that you cannot help but remember closing out with one final ding while it is only my 3rd favorite radiohead album the fact that they got from pablo honey the generic rock album to ok computer an alt rock masterpiece full of unique soundscapes in just 4 years blows me away the weaker tracks are still amazing and even the interlude does a damnnear flawless job at representing the album i could not have asked for anything more and it still remains clear to me why some people say that it is the greatest album of all time,5.00,5319
although every decade since the 1970s has produced fewer classic records than each of its predecessors the absolute best of the 90s are on par with the masterworks of any era in fact there appears to be a growing consensus of critical praise toward the more ambitious side of the decades alternative and indie rock movements an indian summer of creativity that exploited increased studio accessibility to temporarily cut through the overly commercialized nature of the music industry standing at the absolute pinnacle of arty alternative rock excellence is radioheads ok computer this is a latterday classic that is fully deserving of all the praise even when that praise rivals the adoration bestowed upon the beatles pink floyd and company i will not pretend that it is my alltime favorite album or that it is somehow beyond reproach but it is a seminal release that any serious music fan immediately needs to acquire thousands of pages have already been written about ok computer and i have little to add about the records overall sound suffice it to say that the album is filled with slowburning alternative rock and that it manages to sound thoroughly modern despite the fact that traditional rock instrumentation is given at least as much space as synth experimentation a perfect marriage of old and new that is unrelated to the contemporaneous postrock movement but succeeds for many of the same reasons i will also note that while ok computer frequently draws comparisons to the subsequent kid a it is equally easy to characterize it as a natural extension of the more deliberate tracks off the bends ok computer is still distinctly less alternative rock sounding than its immediate predecessor meaning that listeners who are not already alternative rock fans should have better luck with the synthdominated kid a but everybody who likes ok computer should give both of those surrounding albums an honest try personally i would rank ok computer as one of the best sounding records in my entire collection the sound production here is absolutely stunning and special kudos goes to producer nigel godrich and multiinstrumentalist jonny greenwood for squeezing the most out of every melody thom yorke is also at the height of his game delivering the best collection of vocal melodies in his career as readers of my reviews are undoubtedly aware i usually do not fixate on the lyrical content of albums but ok computer is a big exception a perfect encapsulation of cynicism in the information age my only significant stylistic complaint about the record is that yorke occasionally crosses the line from emotive to needlessly melodramatic this is especially true on ballads like exit music for a film or the tourist whose operatic choruses provide plenty of ammunition for those who enjoy deriding radiohead for yorkes whiny singing at 53minutes the album is also 510 minutes longer than it really needs to be but it is remarkably restrained for its era and rarely sounds overlong while you are actually listening to it minor criticisms for a record that does almost everything right ok computer still would not be nearly as fantastic if it was not for a superlative collection of underlying tunes i hear three stonecold classics in paranoid android karma police and no surprises the first of which is arguably one of the best and most inventive alternative rock tracks of all time the remainder of the album is filled with stellar deep cuts many of which would have qualified as standouts on any other radiohead record however my opinions about these tracks differ slightly from the norm i am not nearly as sour on electioneering as many hardcore fans although i will admit that it is guitardriven melody would have sounded more at home on the bends whether or not you love electioneering should be a good indicator of whether you will place the bends in the same league as ok computer i do i have also never particularly warmed to either exit music for a film or the tourist i would not classify either of those latter selections as mediocre but they are both extremely slow and i am repeatedly turned off by the aforementioned dose of melodrama if you ignore fitter happier that means that nine out of the eleven tracks on ok computer are excellent and that is one hell of a ratio that is only matched by a handful of records in my collection ok computer is an obvious 50star record that rivals siamese dream smashing pumpkins as my favorite release of the 90s if you absolutely love what you hear on this album also be sure to check out the associated airbag ep which is significantly less stunning but includes six leftovers from the same studio sessions 9410,5.00,4667
instead of straightforward themes and guitarwork typical of the early 90s on ok computer radiohead opted for abstract lyrical content and glitchy instrumentation although i am not the biggest rock listener this is still one of my favorite albums of all time i do not think it is 1 per say but it is one of the first albums i listened to and i definitely understand the hype this change in direction for radiohead can be heard immediately in the first track airbag the lack of clarity in the lyrics can be observed by reading the first lines on the album  in the next world war in a jackknifed juggernaut i am born again these lyrics are an allusion to thom yorkes car accident and the airbag that saved his life the glitchy instrumentation can be heard in the drum pattern throughout and the sound effects in the second half of the song this was an amazing opener and just a very sentimental track in the radiohead discography an aspect of radioheads music that remains unchanged from their previous records are the saddening lyrical settings and instrumentals some moments on this album are incomparably melancholic and hopeless among them include the emotional climax at the end of exit music for a film the third switchup on paranoid android and the chorus of lucky in addition fitter happier is an unusual interludetype track near the middle of the album with a texttospeech voice stating various daily tasks of many people in a saddening fashion accompanied by offputting soundeffects and piano it was an unxpected highlight depsite the lack of vocals from thom there are tracks on this album that take a different approach to mood as well many tracks have contrasting lyrical and instrumental moods  for example airbag no mistakes and let down the instrumentals for the first two are both melancholic and cheerful at different parts but the lyrical content is completely hopeless they explore themes of death suicide and pessimism respectively subterranean homesick alien and the tourist are noteworthy because of their spacey and laidback instrumentals the slow and jazzy instrumentals of both compliment the lyrical themes in the tourist the chorus of hey man slow down is meant to symbolize how some people tourists as a synecdoche here move in life too quickly subterranean homesick aliens themes of isolation are also complimented by the slow gloomy instrumental the guitar solos on this album are also notable paranoid android contains a guitar solo near the middle that is chaotic and suits the tone of the song amazingly but the best solo on this album is easily the one at the end of the tourist the high tones are very emotive and are a great way to conclude the album although i love much of this album there remain uninteresting moments  namely the unadventurous and uninteresting instrumental of let down  that has not aged well let down has some things to like including the touches of synth at the end but this track has always sounded like it could be in a commercial it is a little too easygoing for my taste and i have always felt the lyrics do not portray insincerity and disappointment as well as they intend to climbing up the wall has a cool eerie mood and nice instrumental embellishments in the last part of the track however it is nothing special in my opinion compared to the rest of the record electioneering is the worst track on ok computer in my opinion although it is livelier than let down it also sounds like generic commercial music it feels very out of place in the tracklist because of how straightforward and tireless it is the lyrical themes on this album are relatively nuanced but there is really no layers to peel back here overall this song is just a bore although i am not as praiseworthy of it as most rock fans i still love ok computer if you enjoy adventurous instrumentals abstract lyricism and want to listen to a more melancholic rock record then i recommend this album even if you are not a fan of rock music this is a greatentry point strong recommendation,4.00,4013
there are some albums i always forget how much i love them then i see them with 5 stars on my ratings and i start to doubt my pastself so i give it another listen after some long time and i am always like nope this is indeed fucking beautiful ok computer is one of those albums i do not think i have enough words in my vocabulary to explain what i feel when listening to it the music radiohead was able to create within this album format this 50minute 12song format so replicated and so wellknown by all of us goes beyond reality but also never reaches the kind of surreal habitat of imagination it is almost a twilight zone kind of album it is music that defies expectations but never feels offgrounded as if the whole world existed for millions of years solely for the purpose of this album being made but also as if this is no big deal just keep walking except now the whole ground is shattered the weight of living given a face a story a sentimentality almost an inside out kind of shit where emotions have their own emotions ok computer breaks jaws bleeds eternally crashes from the sky straight to the center of the earth it leaves from the other side not more gigantic not more ridiculous but purely more human a journey so technically flawless that only existed when fueled by delicacy attention and emotion pure raw strong glowing emotions an exercice of humanity reflected mirror by mirror into infinity challenging comprehension space time and rational thoughts it just is and there it lies the beauty of life,5.00,1520
i really really wish i did not like this album so much everything about it seems awful in abstraction it is a 90s altrock album mostly made up of slower songs with a robotic spokenword interlude orwellian themes and slightly whiny vocals by a band that sound a little too much like the beatles except for one thing the songwriting and the vocals and the performance are absolutely incredible it is not a trivial thing to make such a captivating album while seeming so unapologetically generic in style sure there are a few weaknesses here but this album contains some of the best rock songwriting ever and it is a timeless work even if paranoid android is a little cheesy there i said it,0.50,687
ok computer is an artistic statement it took the dying soul of rock music and did something completely new with it and although i think it is in part along with kid a responsible for the massively diminished prominence of rock in the mainstream i feel it elevated the genre as an artform ok computer forms a truly powerful and forwardthinking narrative about the state of the modern world and the looming and inevitable threat of technology as a means of division among people the album is soaked in anxiety paranoia and isolation the themes are perfectly built in its instrumentation and thoms highpitched lamenting vocals paranoid android is the best radiohead song to date it is the artsy music fans bohemian rhapsody but it tells a much more powerful story with the ending segment standing out as one of the most harrowing yet beautiful moments in music let down and exit music are two of the best vocal performances of all time they add massively to the songs impressive writing and instrumental structure turning these from great to alltime great tracks the finale in the tourist is just so fitting with thom belting to slow down a insightful warning to a frantic and rapidly declining world ok computer is a true masterpiece,4.50,1231
lots of things have been said about ok computer it is praised by lots of people and it is ranked as the best album of all time in rym is it actually the best album ever i do not claim that it is but it is a legitimate candidate for this title this album is often compared to kid a and in rainbows when people argue what is the best radiohead album kid a is the most innovative album out of these three in rainbows is the most diverse one and ok computer is the most consistent one and not only that ok computer is the most consistent radiohead album it also features their best songs ever simply radiohead at their best every song in this album is great paranoid android delivers powerful moments with hardrocking guitars along with touching moments as this song has a unique structure exit music for a film gives me goose pimples at the end of the song every time i hear it partly because the first time i heard this song was in black mirror airbag opens the album with a very optimistic vibe and is more unique and complex than any song on the bends showing the listener that ok computer is not just another simple album another great song from this album is climbing up the walls which is the true underrated song in this album an emotional song that explodes in the end and you cannot forget the most wellknown quote from the music industry for a minute there i lost myself from karma police which is one of the best moments in this album i can keep talking about the songs but that is not my point in this review all of the songs are great on their own but it is their compilation that creates this masterpiece as all of the songs while being very different have a common vibe that i cannot really explain well but it is those little electronic touches in each song combined with jonny greenwoods electric guitar this vibe integrated in each song creates the sound of ok computer listening to this album in it is order really gets the best out of each song for example fitter happier is not a song that you will enjoy listening on its own but it feels just right in the mood between karma police and electioneering another thing about this album is that it ages really well which is not something that you can say about a lot of albums and the more i listen to this album the more i like it this album grew on me slowly ok computer is truly a masterpiece and an essential album for every music listener 55,5.00,2410
i do not really understand the massive amount of acclaim this album gets among the music community while there are certainly songs on the album that i found to be quite good such as let down and electioneering the majority of the record i found to be quite dull and uninteresting i understand that a lot of people enjoy this kind of melancholic sound and do not get me wrong i greatly enjoy some depressing sounding albums like joy division and interpol but i feel like the band could have kept the general atmosphere of this album while still adding a little more power to it i am not saying radiohead are a bad band and i am not giving it this score just to be a contrarian i am just saying this album did not really do it for me in the same way it did for many others who knows perhaps some of their other albums will win me over,2.00,832
i was sitting in my bedroom longing for a taste and feeling that could present me adequate sustenance i decided i needed to stand up to satisfy my immense craving that is what i did i ventured out of my bedroom for the first time since 1007 pm the night before and traveled into the kitchen i had reached the kitchen my appetency was far more brutal than previously i needed to feast i grabbed a ham egg and cheese hot pocket out of my freezer which was cooled to negative ten degrees fahrenheit that was it i am now estatic euphoric even a full sense of irrational manic happiness had breached the walls of my mind i put my hot pocket in the microwave for two minutes i gaze at my delicious morsel completing revolutions as the burning radiating ray of light shot the hot pocket with means to become edible feeding i took my hot pocket out of the microwave i took in an enormous whiff of the pure culinary genius presented in front of my face i then took a bite an orgy took place in my mouth pure brilliance discovery i then felt a slight pain in my stomach oh no i said to myself i have to shit i had reached my limit of culinary consumption i ran to the lavatory to relinquish this excrement inside of me i grabbed my iphone 6 out of my pocket and opened spotify this is when i saw that an album by an artist i had heard of radiohead was recommended to suit my palette of artistic sound this was ok computer i clicked on the play button immediately my ears faced an unparalleled orgasm caused by the untainted perfection that is ok computer i had never witnessed anything this unsurpassably magnificent even as a form of lava was seeping out of my anus i felt at peace within ten seconds of the album being played i started masturbating i had to as it was too divine of a stimulation to my ears to abstain nine hours passed i had not stopped masturbating to this piece of heavenly brilliance i thought could only exist in a world of idealistic utopias conflict my mother pounded on the door i am going to fucking break in if you do not get your ass off of the shitter she screamed very angrily i just could not stop stimulating my genitalia to this indefectible marvel i just could not i opened the window in the bathroom and climbed out of it i ran quickly for 1 hour feeling the pain that is chastity i caught a train i did not know where it was going but i could not live a life without my one and only love in this cruel society of nightmarish antiindividualistic totalitarianism so i seized this opportunity at peace i was masturbating in the bathroom of this train for twentyseven hours when it made its final stop in minot north dakota a rural desolate land i knew i could live here in peace finally endlessly masturbating to ok computer by radiohead this is where i am and this is where i will stay,0.50,2810
words cannot describe how passionate and deserving this album is to be ranked number one on the charts the album ok computer completely took me by surprise and now is my favorite album ever the rock aspect put on alternative music really shines with radiohead other radiohead albums like the blends and a moon shape pool are amazing albums but this one takes the top of all other radiohead albums the true impact this album has on alternative music is truly amazing and i hope that this album will pioneer a new stage of music in the coming years,5.00,546
i meanis there really anything new i can say about ok computer that has not been before in its past 1567 rym reviews it is ok computer for heavens sake radioheads greatest release and one of the greatest albums in music history calling this album an easy listen is debatable depending on whether the person you are asking is a religious follower of doomer ideologies but the themes of alienation are so unbelievably strong it is difficult to swallow at certain points i mean do i have to point out the most obvious of oneliners wellunfortunately yeah that is what this album is mostly about among other things the emptiest of feelings disappointed people clinging on to bottles and when it comes it is so so disappointing let down and hanging around crushed like a bug in the ground she will smashed juices flowing wings twitch legs are going do not get sentimental it always ends up drivel one day i am going to grow wings a chemical reaction hysterical and useless a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal you look so tired unhappy bring down the government they do not they do not speak for us i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxide and no alarms and no surprises nevermind how crazy the instrumental work and thoms bleeding vocals sound the closest to perfection any band or solo musician has ever attempted to reach one important thing to note is that if you love this album then i urge you to listen to the oknotok 1997 2017 rerelease version you are really missing out on an equally amazing collection of bsides and previouslyunreleased songs from the bands recording sessions around ok computers original release my goodness i promise man of war and lift are all equally gorgeous,5.00,1758
radioheads ok computer is beyond visionary and careful in its craft from any standpoint it is safe to call it a masterpiece it is a fully cohesive conceptual piece which on top offers a wide variety of nuances and textures for all tastes from the epicness found in paranoid android to the grunginess of electioneering a unique and immensely replayable album,5.00,357
it is ok computer there is not much that i can say that hundreds of people more eloquent than i have already said time and time again undeniably radioheads most famous album and in my opinion an absolute masterpiece that ranks as one of the best albums of its decade radiohead kept all of the fantastic songwriting and instrumentation from their previous album the bends mixed in a little bit more experimentation and made the overall sound darker and wow did it resonate every song on here is fantastic with about half of them ranking in my top 200 songs of all time or so there is an even mix of rockiness and slowness making ok computer perfectly paced and absolutely breathtaking to listen to ok computer deserves every single bit of praise it gets,5.00,752
i do not know why but i feel bad giving this album a high score all the tracks have great diversity amazing melodies and absoloutely gorgeous textures which have stayed fresh after all these years so it is not like it does not deserve that score the themes of disillusionment in society is still relevant to this day and this album is genuinely timeless maybe it is just because it is such a popular album and i like to pretend i am cool the only complaint i can really make is that thom yorkes diction is horrible in places but its not that often and the instrumentation backing the vocals up are interesting enough to carry the songs you have almost certainly listened to this but if you have not what are you putting it off for,5.00,730
whether desired or not radiohead made art and merchandise meet exactly in the middle and i am buying,3.50,100
so here it is radioheads 1997 album ok computer a delve into the mind of the modern man and artistic turning point for the band and what a turning point it was radiohead pre okc was a patchwork of grungy 90s rock clichs but with some pretty good ideas on the bends many of which hinted at what was to come radiohead post okc is experimental cerebral and altogether strange rock music and it was ok computer that allowed that huge leap to happen it was here that radiohead began to truly flex their muscles and the real talent of the band finally came through as such it is significance cannot be overstated it is quality however can and has been repeatedly enough times to last a lifetime a glance at this albums critical reception tab on wikipedia will show a 1010 from pitchfork a 1010 from nme and a host of 4 to 5 stars writer tim footman who apparently loved ok computer to write an entire book about it noted that not since 1967 with the release of sgt peppers lonely hearts club band had so many major critics agreed immediately not only on an albums merits but on its longterm significance and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history high praise indeed first let us talk about themes yorke writes about dissolusionment with modern life depression mundanity frustration at politics and boredom i imagine yorke was reading a lot of philip larkin at the time a poet who i would wholeheartedly reccomend to anyone who enjoys the lyrical themes of the album the instrumentals also tie in very nicely being loaded with glitchy bleeps robot voices and ethereal soundscapes and i will admit not many albums do this to the degree that ok computer does the theme of boredom however is the one that prevails the most in the instrumentals because it is exactly how the album makes the listener feel second the tracks it blows it is load in the first half with paranoid android and exit music providing some much needed excitement that is not found again until electioneering a track that along with no suprises which its suitably chilling artificial sounding melody just about saves the second half from complete mediocrity the rest is just padding ok computer is yet another case where contextual significance gets confused with quality,3.00,2250
 i will try to keep it short and sweet thoughts 1 glorification in reviews without specific points in sound defense of a recording can be irritating 2 i am not a huge radiohead fan though i do not think they are overrated overrated is just another way of saying why cannot we all like the same things 3 edit here i scratched out the part where i say that i do not think ok computer is overrated i just do not understand the album that is right call me confused if you think this album is the greatest thing since sliced bread that is perfectly fine i can accept that shit my nutty idiotic head thinks crimsos starless and bible black is the greatest rock album ever made in spite of its flaws no album is perfect thom yorke once remarked on music as an art form in an interview upon the release of ok computer good riddance at least he knows 4 this album opens with a characterless avantgardeish riff complemented with a characterless clean guitar melody then they add characterless beats in the middle they throw in characterless sounds this is not what i understand as passion i really do not have the will to go deeper into the opener 5 paranoid android is supposedly inspired by pink floyd and queen that is just trivia to me i could care less the song comes in sections but that is also rendered a trivia it starts off with an okflamenco riff followed by unconvincing ascendingdescending tunes sung with an unconvincing voice goes into boring 78 bars cannot really say the electric piano was a fitting choice continues into a loud section  it all just sounds like sonic information this is not what i understand as forwardthinking mentality or passion either at least the melodically similar but more subdued knives out fares well in terms of mood thanks to the clever choice of chords and chord changes cherry on top these guys had the sack to claim that the song was conceived as a joke i really do not know how to peacefully meet something that i found to be fake modesty at what point in the history of human civilization did we start genuinely enjoying novelty music but if it is something satirical like we are only in it for the money then i can understand 6 the first thing on the album i have come to like was fitter happier believe it or not then time told me that it is just a naive experiment 7 the second and last thing i have come to like on the album was the fact that they snuck a 24 bar in every verse of lucky but that was it 8 i am certainly not qualified to say anything about the lyrics my head works this way first i have to like the music and then i can get to the lyrics  a good reason for me not to rate the album if you fail at musicwriting and production perhaps you have no business making music at this time you might as well just stick to articulating your thoughts and expressing your feelings in the form of a novel an essay or a poem 9 it is a good thing that you want to follow the path of adventurous production but jesus christ artsy rock music has been done way better before  and after  in much more imaginative ways that betray the fact that the artists and the producer have actually applied themselves to making something that reflects a poetic lust for love truth peace a good life i am looking at you guys in fugazi  i meant slowdive  well both of them and no i do not think all music should be done one way  man taste is a tricky fucking thing you want more 10 there is something offputting about the ridiculous melodrama in the combo of straightahead minorkey music high dynamo and dense mixing on exit music climbing up the walls and the tourist it is so cheap it tries so desperately to sound dark to the point of bitingyourownfist but ends up sounding laughably cheesy this should have been an important lesson for everyone you cannot fake pain and solemnity when you do not value subtlety 11 sterility fakery a chore to listen to i feel like i have really given up on this one 12 in defense of this album why do i not hate ok computer several months ago i wrote a scathing piece about a 2018 album by a certain songstress who years prior used to come out with some truly aweinspiring material the album is really a despicable piece of dreck enjoyed by people who have questionable history of musiclistening experience forgive me for sounding like an asshole snob on that one ok computer is not exactly like that at least for the most part it sounds musical for the most part i mean it has some semblance of organization  eh so no i do not hate the album i just do not like it well that is as short and sweet as it gets and it is kind of nice to know that i am not perfect dislikers are going to dislike right ok so maybe there is some venting in here ps i wrote this review just because i felt like it it is probably like some kind of a twisted form of release one more insignificant review  check,0.50,4851
everyone says ok computer is a classic for a reason and the songs i love the most on it are not even necessarily the ones that people celebrate most often which i guess shows you just how good it is many parts of this album do tend to be a bit pompous and rockist though and while all of these songs are good not all of them are necessarily that unique or exciting,4.00,364
this review is a part of my ongoing exploration of radioheads discography so it is come to this cosmia on radiohead the album ok computer christ if i wrote about modern alienation and the 21st century and the human condition and thatcherism and blairism and corporations and dystopia like better writers than i have that would be a cliche if i said something like you have read all about this album already you do not need me to go over it again that would be a cliche if i said something like it is ok computer what else do you need to know that would be cliche too even if i just left the title up there without giving it a writeup it would seem a little onthenose you cannot say anything new about this album you cannot even say that you cannot say anything new about this album because a million people have already pointed that out wait i could say that i had a weird sex dream where i was hooking up with my high school crush in buckingham palace and the ceiling was a giant poster of the ok computer cover art i guess that is something new right now this will not feel so much like spitting into the pacific ocean the cover cold abstract alienated not my favorite radiohead cover but it sets the tone and the lost child bit is nicely eerie time for cosmias opinion right i am not going to act like my opinions unpopular there is no opinion on ok computer that is unpopular as annoying as it is to be read nutritional facts about its importance and ambition it is even more annoying when people act like they are in the french resistance because they think fitter happier is lame insofar as any opinion i have is important it sure is not this one so ok computer is an undeniably great album but it is not even close to my favorite radiohead album i am not going to say that the riff in paranoid android does not kick ass i am not going to say that exit music for a film does not knock my socks off with its climax i am not going to say that let down does not remind me in its forward motion and quiet anxiety of riding the london underground the forbidding beauty and terror of climbing up the walls the gentle resignation of no surprises the slow descent of the tourist into a single chiming bell all unimpeachable and yet this will probably make me sound like a stupid asshole but there is a real we live in a society vibe that i get off this album the bends had a bit of that but for the most part it remained subtext and while future albums leaned into the whole dystopian thing even harder they showed rather than told which i will get into more when i get to those albums but here you can see the influence of the big statement record prog acts like pink floyd try as radiohead might to deny it and i am not sure that is what i like in my radiohead i said most bands that sound like radiohead are influenced by the bends the exception is muse who are definitely inspired by ok computer that is not to say that this album is not evocative climbing up the walls is an instant paranoiaboost making even the most quotidian activity fraught with dread no surprises encompasses the deadening tedium and the curious comfort of daily life better than any song i can think of and while fitter happier is as subtle as a notatallsubtlething it is undeniably effective with its microsoft sam drone and the snatches of voices and piano underneath it it really does feel dystopian but it does not feel natural it feels less like the frightening moredystopianthanthealternative reality we live in and more like a selfconscious representation of it and that is why this album brilliant as it is does not reach the full potential of what radiohead can do except for best song subterranean homesick alien i said earlier that there are no unpopular opinions when it comes to ok computer but i still felt a bit uneasy about naming this the best song on the album exit music for a film and no surprises were close runnersup and both would be more representative of what this album sounds like but subterranean homesick alien is the closest this album comes to my ideal version of radiohead inscrutable jazzy warm and cold at the same time bitches brew was an influence on ok computer and you can hear it most clearly here those electric keyboards are as sunsetstreaked and welcoming as the ones you would hear on a song like sanctuary it is dreamy astral jazzrock like floating through neoncolored mists between skyscrapers and it does not forget a great big hook uptight uptight hell yeah assorted great moments the drumming on airbag thoms arcing vocal melody in the first section of paranoid android the transition from section one to section two in that song any of jonnys solos on that song the climax of exit music the dueling thoms building to transcendence in the climax of let down the piano of karma police the strings in climbing up the walls going from rich to downright pendereckiesque in their terror the chiming guitar of no surprises the bell that ends the tourist ding,4.50,4976
it is really pretentious which i find unbearable most of the time but it has a good variety of songs and you will probably like at least one of them,3.50,148
ok computer 1997 by radiohead is the obvious standout a big cultural touchstone of the boom times it was so huge that even a local paper was called the kensington sun just for referring to it the massappeal could be seen as integral to the success of the first radiohead album ok computer this bands name is also used to refer to a number of allamerican rock bands  all of which received some major rockstar treatment when they came to american shores johnny cash was called cash jerry lee lewis was called lee stone temple pilots was called stone and members of the national lampoon who of course currently is known as the national lampoon and has their own catalog of pix ok computer 1997 by radiohead is one of those rare pieces of music that fans could easily dismiss as hokey guitarplucked nonsense but it does not take long to begin to appreciate just how thoughtful and generous that sampling is yeagerrrrrh every track on this record  from the twinkling tinkle of making out to a graveyard dirge to the scuffing sounds of the reverseengineered classical stylings of the title track  bursts with a carefully crafted bit of experimental instrumentation before accelerating in a heady newwave vibe classic numetal may have been a dead genre by this point but this exhilarating poppysounding debut is a great reminder of the genres wide appeal,4.50,1347
i have changed my mind this is definitely a really good album karma police and electioneering are kind of weak points for me but all in all definitely a top 3 radiohead record,4.50,175
is it your best album in my opinion yes is it the best album in history do not i do not deny that this album is great it has mythical moments but sometimes i think that they exaggerate a bit in putting it as the masterpiece of the 90s or putting it first in the list of the best albums of all time on this page but hey that is what i think maybe in the future i will change my mind i give it an 8510 notable tracks airbag paranoid android karma police let down no surprises,4.00,473
thm make band band rdiohd creep huge hit but album shit rdiohd fans creep only pls rdiohd oh no thm let us get creative rdiohd make two of the greatest alternative albums of the 90s rdiohd fans oh shit rym oh shit rym best all time rym no flaws rym rdiohd invented music rym cannot beat it other albums hey rym hope you like rym copied rdiohd ok computer rating soaring with no end in sight queen elizabeth alexandra mary knights thm pope canonizes thm presidet tramp i know a lot of sounds believe me no sounds better than thms god resigns he is just better than me,4.50,566
i do not even particularly like this album it is just that it is so strong emotionally every time i choose to put it on i get that sense of dread it is like a critic of a world were everybody lives a happy dream the atmosphere is so sterile every single time i am on a highway i feel just like this album sounds each song stands on its own but as a whole this album is creating a place rather than telling a story,5.00,413
ok computer by radiohead an album held in such wide high regard by music critics dare i say i am a bit nervous to review this album i dare radiohead has always been a band to me that either you get or did not get i have always wanted to get radiohead unfortunately for me to this point i have not been able to get it i have given this album a halfhearted listen to back in college when i was first really trying to expand my musical horizons i did not appreciate it but i like to think my ear has grown since then physical or otherwise and i am ready to give it another go a better set of headphones a more focused listening style and a vehement want to like this album are ready to go without further ado the album starts off with airbag and i have to say somehow i feel like i am already enjoying this album a lot more than i remember i have this odd memory of it just being so bland and inoffensive but i was clearly wrong right off the bat this song has a clean sounding grunge oxymoron i know ambiance to it from thoms slurred singing to the grimy guitar but then is transformed in the last minute with some futuristic sounding dj work on to one of my favorite named tracks on the album paranoid android you are greeted with an acoustic intro that slowly builds on brooding vocals and teasing you a few times till you get the grandiose release around the halfway point with a stellar guitar solo that then fades quickly into hymnlike chanting but not before closing with an abrupt flashy guitar riff this song sonically captures that essence of paranoia the mood swings the anxiousness the the longing for what is to come this track shows the artistic prowess that yorke has made himself famous for as an anecdote had the 2001 film ais soundtrack not been composed by the legendary john williams i think this could have been a terrific slot in at some point and not just because of the name subterranean homesick alien is the first track i really love on the project mostly because i think this reminds of the radiohead that i do already know and enjoy like high and dry from their previous album the bends the guitar is psychedelic and futuristic and thoms vocals are the cleanest and most impassioned so far on this track list exit music for a film is again another well named track although this time it does not seem quite so clever when you know the backstory this is the song that plays as the credits roll in baz luhrmanns rendition of romeo  juliet that anecdote aside i think you could slot this into any closing credits sequence and it would be a perfect fit for any drama the somber guitars that very slowly crescendo in the end accompanied by yorkes lyrics of we hope that you choke makes for a horrifying albeit fitting arrangement additionally i think this definitely earns a place in my personal hall of fame of fantastic postbreakup songs the sixth track on the album is another favorite of mine karma police this track shows how thom yorke can take what looks like simple lyrics at face value and elevate it so much more just by performance and choice of backing instrumentals the i lost myself outro paired with the psychedelic and screeching guitar parts gives the listener their own feeling of falling down that rabbit hole fitter happier is less of a track and more of a social commentary of how the band feels about society as a whole although i appreciate the haunting message and the excellence of its delivery i often do not appreciate being preached to in such an on the nose kind of way as the subtlety here is about as much as a brick in the small of my back now after that minirant this is going to sound awkward but electioneering an incredibly politically driven track in case the name did not give it away is definitely one of my favorite tracks on the project but this song is also exactly what i was talking about it may be blunt in its narrative but delivery is important and being able to pair a message with a foot stomping rock track feels a lot less agendaed than an ominous robotic voice reciting the bullet points of life that society expects me to live by climbing up the walls is an eerie and haunting track that only gets more unsettling as it continues on the strings and vocals become slowly more and more distorted until about two thirds of the way through where the track reaches its blownout climax that only incites more anxiety this song gave me a very bizarre and creepy visual while listening to it it was like being sat in a hard wooden chair across from a painters easel in a dimly lit basement the only light coming from atop the stairs in classic horror movie fashion and i just sat there as black water color paint dripped from the top to the bottom and ran off the edges but i could not move to stop it as much as i wanted to to me this is a song that really harps on the effects of mental illness something of which that hits close to home for a lot of people including myself i love this track almost in a sadistic way because of the sheer level of emotion that this song evokes but as uncle ben famously said with great power comes great responsibility and i could not recommend you add this particular track to a daily listen playlist listen to this track when you need it most when you need a catharsis for emotions you feel others would not be able to empathize with that is how powerful this track is to me back on track to the rest of the album no surprises is a very odd track sonically it has these very plucky string parts and glockenspiel that emulates a very springlike and happy emotion that is juxtaposed against some very harsh lyrics the song starts with a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal it honestly just leaves me feeling very confused more so than anything else the penultimate track lucky raises an eyebrow for me now i do not know if this is intentional especially because it feels a little out of character for yorke but this feels like a powertrip of a song for thom with a chorus of pull me out of the air crash pull me out of the lake because i am your superhero we are standing on the edge and the second verse starting with the head of state has called for me by name but i do not have time for him it leaves a bad taste in my mouth but i must say the track ends with a killer guitar riff that almost makes me forgive the egotistical journey we just on the album ends on the tourist which is a sleepy sounding track through the first four minutes before transitioning into some understated guitar solos that make for a fitting conclusion to the album in just about every way ok computer comes in at 12 songs and 53 minutes in run time which i would say is right about the sweet spot but this album took me almost exactly double that time to listen to all the way through and do my simultaneous write up that really speaks to the power that this album has behind it that being said this might be my most thorough review to date and i did do some halfdecent research into the project after the fact what i am getting at is i understand why critics praise this album to the degree that they do aside from impeccable production and arrangement that certainly speaks for itself thematically and compositionally i am not sure you can do much better this is an album that like ogres and onions has layers and that is what i am positive so many people find attractive about this album it is deeply relatable and progressive in its message it almost feels like if this were a movie i would immediately would have told you it was designed to be oscar bait but this also i think further proves my point on getting radiohead those that wish to peel back the aforementioned layers will find a treasure trove waiting for them but for those that do not as i once was are left with an album that sounds good but is very weird and unconventional a combination that i would not have rated nearly as high as i have it rated now i still do not think that i get radiohead but i think i am close overall this album is beautiful but in a way that i did not think i could ever describe an album it is exhausting the beauty is something that is almost earned rather than presented which i suppose is part of the allure of the project it is well worth the listen but i definitely understand if it simply is not for you high notes subterranean homesick alien karma police electioneering honorable mentions climbing up the walls,4.00,8453

radiohead has been one of the biggest rock bands of the past thirty years and has been instrumental in shaping modern pop music as a whole their career began with a single hit creep a catchy little song about loneliness and isolation and its accompanying album pablo honey an alright collection of assorted altrock and grunge songs however between this album and the release of their next album something happened thom yorke fancied himself the tortured artist who was not content with fame whose profound statements on society and culture which were on the level of high school emo poetry written in the back pages of a discarded notebook needed to be heard by everyone his newfound sense of selfimportance and selfpity led to the bends a mediocre album that basically sanitized any sense of selfawareness and edginess that the altrock at the time had in exchange for a bland wash of nonsense still there were some good songs here and there such as my iron lung that resembled their original catchiness and then came this album when any band starts with something like pablo honey and ends up here they are often compared to a band like the beatles however the beatles songwriting capabilities were always stellar and their later music was actually experimental and innovative for the time ok computer is devoid of any real experimentation and innovation recycling old styles in and meshing them into once again a bland wash of nonsense without any real emotional potency this just seems like an attempt to become something more than the sum of their parts thom yorke is even more annoying on this release as well he retains this whiny and clingy vocal strain the average circlejerking hipster would refer to as ethereal and isolated but is devoid of true intent and emotional potency sounding like some ironic rebuttal rather than a genuine problem i could potentially look past this if his tendency to compose a jumble of egotistical and pretentious lyrics that truly sound like an angsty teenagers diary was not so earsplitting fitter happier is a perfect example of this a robotic voice lists off a bunch of problems that thom yorke lists with society as he yearns to return to a more earnest time why does not he sing this with his own voice is it an attempt to be clever by making a robot list off things that society requires to make it sound automated yes but it sounds like a teenager saying no repeatedly and making an ironic agreement with whatever somebody is saying to them without actually bringing up a concrete reason as to why it is a problem this sort of cringy discontent with society is apparent throughout the album such as in let down and subterranean homesick alien other tracks are slightly more subtle in their lyricism and have a little more depth and deal with personal issues but thom yorkes lackadaisical and rather dull voice put me to sleep while that may be the point that point does not make for good singing or music speaking of the music the music as previously stated is a bland mix of other styles in an attempt to create something new most of the songs are castrations of altrock music to make the music sound more dejected they are all something we have heard before but worse there is nothing remotely innovative on this album the songs that do veer from this formula often fall flat on their face airbag while one of the better cuts lyrically and instrumentally sounds like if the smiths and portishead made a song together but without the beautiful instrumental mystery and intrigue of portishead a lot of what radiohead was doing aesthetically with their music was done better by portishead it is just a basic trip hop beat with reverbwashed jangly guitars great fitter happier sounds like the beginning of an aphex twin outtake with its ominous pianos and electronic sound effects but without the musical complexity or intrigue of aphex twin however on a positive note some of these instrumental tracks are the highpoints of the album paranoid android the best song on the whole album is musically captivating in its journey from catchy acoustic melody to complex proghard rock to dirge and back to hard rock and the lyrics are actually not cringeinducing cimbing up the walls also does not have cringeinducing lyrics and sounds rather cryptic in its message and the fuzzedout guitar and violin combination throughout and the dissonance at the end are captivating the song still suffers from thom yorkes incessant moaning this album in my opinion is a lowpoint in a good bands career it is like the redheaded stepchild in my opinion but most people consider it to be the perfect all as allamerican studentathlete it lacks the catchiness of their early work but lacks the experimental and cryptic tendencies of their later work like kid a and amnesiac which are their two best albums in my opinion or the emotional resonance of a moonshaped pool it is overrated and does not deserve the praise it gets,1.50,4945
i revisited this one recently and now i can pinpoint my own criticisms as to why ok computer is not my pick for the greatest album in radioheads discography i originally saw this one as a weird sidestep album to see if they can get away from britpop but now i think of it as a transitional album the first half from airbag to karma police is one of the greatest runs in music from the 1990s even paranoid android a song that i felt was disjointedly put together from various rejected rh songs into one composition is not as jarring as i remember it being the highlight for me will always be let down one of the most beautiful songs this group has ever made i will always be floored by it when it comes on while relistening to this again the climax of that song came in right when i put my foot down on the concrete while getting off of a bus and it felt earthshattering to me the second half from the apple texttospeech monologue onwards is where this album drops a bit in quality this is where i lose interest in listening to the rest of it what bugs me about this side is that it is not as daring to experiment with other genres as the first side is how do you go from the trip hoptinged airbag to the aboveaverage political ballad lucky all of the songs here are not as great as the britpop centric ones from the bends either i would rather put that album on again than sit through the run from electioneering to the tourist so there it is after many a discussion with friends over this album i can finally say that ok computer is good i am honestly ready to put this one to rest after the sessions for it were leaked and yorke released them officially with the profits going to extinction rebellion the greatest honeytrap protest in the 21st century the mystique of this album is dead to me that is a writeup for another time,4.00,1829
there is nothing depressing about being in the presence of great art woody allen once said when discussing ingmar bergmans filmography i echo the same sentiment here sure thom yorke can be a little whiny the music itself is a touch serious but the hooks are still there and there is so much variety on display that ok computer never comes close to boring aside from let down one of my all time favourite tracks i find airbag to be terribly underrated it is a fantastic opener and sets the tone stunning soundscapes all around fantastic guitar work if you find thom yorkes vocals to be in any way pleasing to the ear you will love ok computer just as i do so is this the defacto greatest album of all time who cares,4.50,714
very dense album there a layers of sound even on the couple straightforward rock songs mixed in that sound bendsish it is sound has changed quite a bit from distorted guitars on the bends besides electioneering it has a brighter cleaner spacey sightly sterile tone airbag  solid rocker that could be on the past albums a lyrical killer cars sequel 45 paranoid android this one shows all that they do so well the besdt kind of epic seesaws all over the place impeccable 55 exit music for a film  epic feel love that fuzz pedal then it ends so quietly also the weird sound in the background is interesting 55 let down  great lyrics such a good uplifting 90s song 55 karma police  one of the straightforward songs on here and a great for a minute there i lost myself i lost myself fitter happier  nice bit of weirdness and summation of the themes of the album 45 electioneering  one of the few songs that could easily fit on the bends they do not have many songs that rock with such looseness 45 climbing up the walls  the sound of losing your mind 55 no surprises  the music it a little too sweet for me but a good change from climbing up the walls i suppose would not listen on it is own ever 35 lucky  it is going to be a glorious day 55 the tourist  hey man slow down 55,5.00,1271
this record is obviously one of the most important of all time has brought one of the best productions of his time with an amazing landscapes of maritime sounds sometimes setted on songs like airbag subterranean homesick alien parts of climbing up the walls and in the tourist it peaked their best musical moment for the band too sadly for me it did not hold the brillance of time i would considered this a masterpiece 6 years ago even it gets old for me now spoiler click to read,4.50,480
even when i was not much of a radiohead fan i always thought of ok computer as an easy fourstar record now deciding to officially rate it i went on a little journey where i toyed very seriously with the idea of a lower rating but in the end the quality of the album is kind of inarguable back at the dawn of time when i was first poking around online music forums and properly becoming a nerd a forum friend once told me of his experience of cynics focus bear with me prior to trying to branch into metal he was a very serious jazzfusionart rock fan so focus seemed like a natural way to try and explore the new genre and as a jazz listener he initially clung to the jazzier tracks on the album textures especially then as he grew into actually liking metal and not just tolerating it around his jazz he moved on to preferring how could i because who would not and saw textures for what it was  a fun and adventurous attempt at jazz fusion for a metal band but not a particularly strong fusion track in itself electioneering was for me the rock i clung to when i first came to ok computer because it was the closest thing the album had to a hard rock song nowadays i mean it is not a bad song but now that i actually like the rest of the album and radiohead as a whole i just do not like it that much or at least do not feel compelled to listen to it that was the first crack in my easyfourstar mentality and then what about the tourist is the tourist anyones favourite song i listened to the album just yesterday and now i am sitting here writing a review of it and i cannot even remember what the tourist sounds like except for a feeling that it is too long similarly lucky  not a bad song but i just do not really care plus lyrically and thematically it feels like it is covering ground airbag already covered better a few songs before however the highlights are pretty undeniable  airbag paranoid android let down exit music for a film subterranean homesick alien and no surprises are all top tier karma police and climbing up the walls are probably right down at the bottom of this pile but they are still great i do genuinely like fitter happier too even if it does not really count as a song that is a strong collection of some of the best music of its era which makes a pretty strong case in the albums favour and it still sounds like it fell into 1997 from some other place  not necessarily the future but despite boiling down to just five guys with regular rock instrumentation it does not quite sound like anything else it is the attitude i guess it does not bother with the swagger of the britgenre bands of the 90s and the bands it influenced going forward just seemed to take the vocals and turn them into whining without capturing anything else whatever  there is a more articulate discussion than i am capable of to be had here and i am sure many others have already had it ultimately i suppose i am in music for the sounds and the songs so for me this is just a collection of a few of the best,4.00,3010
disc 1  side a eeny airbag  a good opening i just think it is too long paranoid android  one of my favorite songs not only from radiohead but all i have ever heard perfect in every way subterranean homesick alien  another perfect song disc 1  side b meeny exit music for a film  perfect simple as that let down  putting the doomer jokes aside i think this track is really good really good just thoms voice that left me a little  karma police  another perfect one let us move on to the next disc 2  side a miney fitter happier  another perfect iconic track electioneering  i love this track my favorite from the climbing up the walls album  iconic and perfect no surprises  what talk about the music that marked 2 generations important iconic and beautiful disc 2  side b mo lucky  p e r f e i t a the tourist  p e r f e i t a 2 1010,5.00,832
you know for as long as i have actively listened researched and sought out music almost ninetyfive percent of that music good or bad has made me feel some sort of emotion it made me laugh it made me cry it made me want to throw something heavy through a window lots of it gave me an adrenaline rush a majority has amplified my brooding nature this is a huge part of what i believe is and is not good music an emotional response of course along with a catchy hook and some interesting songwriting the worst thing a band could possibly do is trigger little to no emotional reaction from me even really shitty artists can get something from me taylor swift makes me frustrated at her antics and ego cardi b makes me angry and i want to throw something at her deicide makes me laugh because of how eyerollingly stupid the themes of fake satanism are those are just a few examples but they all share that same trait however as i said the worst thing a band could do is not give me any reason to emotionally invest myself in the music if it leave me with nothing than it is an automatic failure songwriting and catchy hooks be damned ok computer unfortunately has fallen into this whole and so has the rest of radiohead i have given this band too many chances and they wasted them all the issue was present even before i listened to this band everyone kept saying to me listen to radiohead or hey dude have you heard of radiohead and i am like yes i have heard of them i was going to listen to them but i am lazy and i kept forgetting it got to a point where i did not forget and i just did not want to do because i kept getting the same response when ever i even uttered the name i did not want to talk about radiohead and so i did not until i joined rym now here i am sitting here writing review and talking about it recently i have gotten a couple of comments from people complaining about the ratings i have for their first three albums all of which are now deleted because i are not having that shit and my train of though lead me here to this bands page writing about how much of a bore this band is and what a bore they are i will stand by that statement until my ashes are thrown to the wind those comments made me listen to the album one last time to see if i did somehow change my mind spoiler alert i did not this album is bloated uninteresting and leaves me with squat yorke is whiny as fuck and i do not care the atmosphere is bland at the very best it is the average mans 90s music nothing special at all and i partially blame the fan base for hyping it up far too much it reduces the appreciation quality by like ten percent each time and people say this is art rock i am not seeing much art here if i did not know any better i would think this is just another u2 album it is that unmemorable however at the end of the day music is music and it is all based on subjectivity so if you like this album if you like radiohead i do not hate you you are not a bad person for liking this and maybe there is something wrong with me i do not know what i do know is that a lot of people like ok computer and i am fine with that i am just not in those numbers and if you try to convert me again i am going to gather as many copies of okay computer and burn them all this is not a bad band i am just tired of them,1.00,3310
fine i give in this is a great album after listening to kid a i was not expecting something so immediately accessible and satisfying lots of very very special transcendent musical moments i will say though that this album is not perfect in my eyes it is like a 489 so closer to a 5 but i really wish the album was tighter as an experience even on the best songs here there are moments that drag instrumental and atmospheric indulgences that although they sound great make the album feel much longer than it is and this may be a controversial take but i think they should have just cut no surprises it is a lovely lovely song but it sounds sooo similar to let down to my ears and as pleasant as the song is it just does not stick out to me as an important moment on the album in an album chockfull of electrifying moments i do not know i am definitely in the minority about this but removing the song would just make the album a bit tighter,4.50,939
not an album that holds much appeal to me anymore but i can recognise its merits radiohead hugely expand their sound palette here to make a uniquely moody and atmospheric album they do some more interesting things here than on the straightforward rocky the bends but it took adding electronic instruments and krautrock rhythms to their repertoire for them to become truly aesthetically interesting to me,3.50,403
ok computer is an album with few flaws it distorts their sound on the bends and evolves it i like how the album has a relatively slow start that makes paranoid android hit even harder than it would otherwise after the loud almost white noice ending of paranoid android it basically breaks your fall in a sense with subterranean homesick alien which makes the song stand out after this we get the calm and great song exit music for a film that works great as a slower song to relax to and makes it so the next song let down hits harder a whole i could go on and on about the tracks and how well they flow into one another but i will leave you with this ok computer is a truly great album with lyrical depth and explores a lot of good themes it has a good flow but some times it can feel a little slow though it never gets boring stand out tracks are paranoid android exit music for a film and no surprises for me personally,4.50,922
this album shows the protagonists unwillingness and maybe also his uncapability to connect to society in the way it wants them to the protagonist is lost feels alone confused angry and melancholic it exposes our world order as chaotic and incomprehensible to the eyes of the sensitive one and although it does include the pariah clich it flaunts it well,4.50,353
so i just noticed that this is the highest ranked thing on the website and decided to put this obscure alternative band into the spotify so how is it well this thing is basically noisy ambient music as it lacks real riffs or melody so they go for the texture of the sound however in my book to sustain a song of 4 minutes you need more than texture if your songs are going to be so noisy otherwise you should go full ambient instead of putting some guitar playing in the middle although the vocalist sounds so sleepy with his talking i would not call this singning to make me sleep which is a plus it is better than the last tool album but i would not rate it as anything above average,2.50,685
i just think it is forgettable the songs are pleasant enough while they are on it is also a huge fucking slog to get through despite being a pretty average length album probably cuz every damn track is the same overly atmospheric fake experimental shit i like no surprises but in the context of the album it is a fucking drag and a half karma police is good but not good enough to not lose my interest after a few listens sounded better when it was called sexy sadie i am going to the guitars are good but are so forgettable and campy that i find it hard to give a shit why is this the crowning jewel of radioheads career i would do track ratings but i cannot remember for the life of me what most of the songs on here even sound like,1.50,734
since everything that could be said about this album has been said on this site i will just give an unpolished review airbag really is one of the greatest openers of all time to a rock album there is just a special quality to it that i will never be able to describe paranoid android has one of the most exciting climaxes ever with a classic guitar solo subterranean homesick alien is just great with it is weird twangy and aquaticsounding guitars and exit music is so beautifully dreary let down might be radioheads best song it is so dreamy and lush anyway i do not have a lot to say about the other songs on here except i really agree with the sentiment of the tourist and it is a fitting closer for this album it is not that the songs i do not have anything to say about are bad or anything they are all fantastic however electioneering is the one song that is slightly lackluster then the rest the chorus sounds a little generic anyway i can forgive any flaws to this album because the guitar tone and the production is practically perfect i just cannot give it a 5 because the second half is not as special to me as the first half whatever though for all the complaining there is about this album there could be a lot worse albums out there,4.50,1246
radiohead is one of the bands that is always changing their sound and i like that about them the one thing that is mostly always consistent with radiohead is that they make depressing music the songs are good alternative rock with guitars and drums taking over the songs while a robotic voice and sounds take over on tracks like fitter happier the song everyone knows off the album karma police is a great song and the entire album is amazing the production is good songs are good everything about it is good i enjoy radiohead but i can see why and agree why it is a modern classic,4.50,581
wade through this album was physically difficult i literally felt like a masochist while listening to this hysterical elevator music and as a result the album left nothing behind nothing at all absolute vacuum apparently i am too cheerful person and i will never understand what is so special about ok computer and thom yorkes boring vocals i am going to listen to talking heads it was really painfull for me to get through this album 50 minutes of bland boring elevator music oh god i will never understand why people like this album and band so much it is just a blank space for me i will better go and listen talking heads or rhcp or placebo aka real music,1.00,659
could this be the most overrated album of all time i could make a good argument that it is after all it is ryms number onerated album to me it is too stuck in radioheads britpop thing to be really noteworthy when the band cast that aside they finally were able to eclipse europe and take on the world it is an album that i generally enjoy listening to but i get a bit bored after a while paranoid android does not seem nearly as interesting to me as everyone thinks it is,3.00,471
this album is a mixture of classic tunes some of the best ever created with a few moments of filler exit music climbing up the walls lucky  this is peak radiohead the sound of a legendary band firing on all cylinders airbag subterranean the tourist  not so much after hearing the album dozens of times i still cannot remember what the tourist sounds like the only bad track is fitter happier first couple of listens forgettable after a dozen listens irritating ultimately i feel that this is a great album with a bunch of unforgettable songs but a few lulls keep it from living up to the hype for me,3.50,599
right so i have a total of 5 reviews on my account so what am i going to do about it tackle what is considered by many to be the best album of all time because i am obviously qualified to do so i am also fairly new to radiohead so yeah but for real i do not think this is the greatest album of all time or anything but i do really love it of the 4 radiohead albums i have heard so far this is my favorite so let us dive into it the first song here is airbag which honestly i think is alright i like it but it does not grip me that much and i think it is overhyped amongst the fan base the lyrics are solid though the next song is paranoid android and while i have no idea what this song is about i do not care it sounds awesome the heavy breakdown in this song is probably my favorite moment in a radiohead song and i love it and this song then we get subterranean homesick alien which sounds good and has a good concept about wanting to be abducted by aliens because you do not feel at home amongst humans then we get the ominous exit music for a film and i absolutely love it i love the romeo and julietbased story it tells the buildup in instrumentation and thoms voice you also do not see many songs that end with the line we hope that you choke that darkness then transitions into let down which is the saddest song here and i love it thom sounds great here the guitar is beautiful and it has lyrics about a feeling we can all relate to disappointment i love this one then we get the big single karma police i love this song because not only does it sound good but the lyrics here are important with the introduction of cancel culture to the internet this song has more meaning than ever no idea what it means in 1997 but the accusatory lines and the lines saying i have given all i can but it is not enough perfectly exemplify what i feel cancel culture does to start off the second half we get the dark interlude fitter happier it does not have much meaning outside of the album but i love the dark atmosphere it creates then we get fun political anthem electioneering which is led by cowbell percussion and a catchy hook i do not know why but i did not come back to this song like i thought i would then we get climbing up the walls which is considered the first of radioheads creepy songs and i do not like it it has both this creepy atmosphere and also a very slow and boring feel to it and it just does not interest me it is not awful but it is my least favorite here then we get my favorite off my album no surprises the instrumentation here is absolutely beautiful bordering on a lullaby i also love the lyrics about just wanting a normal happy life with no alarms and no surprises absolutely love it then we get lucky which is very similar to airbag and i have similar thoughts i like it well enough finally this album closes with the tourist which is an appropriately slow song reminding us to slow down and enjoy life using the metaphor of a busy tourist to deliver this message just slow down and enjoy the scenery around you overall really good album i would not call it the best album of all time like so many others would but i see where they are coming from my main problem here is just a couple songs that do not really grip me favorites include no surprises let down paranoid android karma police exit music for a film the tourist subterranean homesick alien and electioneering my only least favorite here is climbing up the walls i would give this a light 910 definitely recommend for any music lover,4.50,3524
the ideological blackmail that has been in place since the original live aid concerts in 1985 has insisted that caring individuals could end famine directly without the need for any kind of political solution or systemic reorganization it is necessary to act straight away we were told politics has to be suspended in the name of ethical immediacy bonos product red brand wanted to dispense even with the philanthropic intermediary philanthropy is like hippy music holding hands bono proclaimed red is more like punk rock hip hop this should feel like hard commerce the point was not to offer an alternative to capitalism  on the contrary product reds punk rock or hip hop character consisted in its realistic acceptance that capitalism is the only game in town no the aim was only to ensure that some of the proceeds of particular transactions went to good causes the fantasy being that western consumerism far from being intrinsically implicated in systemic global inequalities could itself solve them all we have to do is buy the right products mark fisher 19682017 thought it was the least good of radioheads supposed masterpieces when i was like 13 continues to overlap most things i can think of since then as far as a definitive artistic statement of neoliberalisms mass psychology it does not really get much better than this,5.00,1333
what can i say about this album that has not been said before nothing albums pretty good though,4.50,95
almost all of my friends do not have the yearning for new and different types of music that i do in fact i doubt hardly any of them have even listened to this album in full ok computer is the first album that i have listened too that captures the loneliness that is pursuing new music when the vast majority does not give a shit about the quality of what goes in their ears thom and the gang let me know that no matter how radically different my music taste to that of the people i spend the most time with but let me know that my pursuit of quality is worth it to the highest degree,5.00,583
ok computer is an album that for me is actually less than the sum of its parts what do i mean by that well there are four songs that i think are excellent paranoid android karma police electioneering and no surprises i also enjoy fitter happier and climbing up the walls is alright but the rest is some of the least interesting and most tepid rock music to ever be soaked in by my ears so if i listen to this album i long for the six songs i actually i like and sitting through the rest makes for a rather boring experience if those same notsogreat songs were on an album with also meh songs maybe i would enjoy it more oh well 5510,2.50,632
have you not listened to the album yet or something i thought that was like a prerequisite to joining this site yknow so go do that then come back and agree with everyone saying it is one of the best albums ever made because it is to this day let down remains up there with my absolute fav tracks made by anyone and it alone would give this album a classic status for me yet it is just one out of a dozen other just as good classics even electioneering is awesome even if a little outoftheblue definitely the album of my generation,5.00,531
listened to this for the first time today during the song no surprises while he was repeating no alarms and no surprises the music suddenly stopped as my system had glitched out but it said it was still playing i thought it was part of the music an ironic surprise positive first impressions overall,4.00,299
after a questionable debut taking many of the worst aspects of alt rock at the time and their solid more refined followup album the bends radiohead perfected their initial sound here in their third album ok computer rather than many tracks that could come off as simple ok computer adds layers upon layers of sound to each track giving the entire album a spacey futuristic atmosphere with droning electronic noise on top of distorted guitar paving the way for some simply excellent soundscapes and atmosphere to complement the alt rock sound that the album has pushing it far above what would be expected of such an album the album keeps its sound very cohesive all throughout a constant tone that is extremely serious and at times depressing the first track airbag starts the album off extremely strong with many elements that when listened to closely almost seem as if they are playing slightly different songs especially the bass which plays a riff very similar to that of porcupine trees hatesong while the other instruments drone on with the aforementioned electronic noises appearing throughout all as thom yorke sings in his unique way putting emotion into the music while simultaneously almost sounding as if he does not really care which ends up working out in the songs favour quite significantly paranoid android is an easy choice for best song on the album or by the band in general a 3 piece song that simply builds upon itself in each section starting off with beautiful layered riffs over a vocal melody that set up the extremely dark tone of it complete with some breathtaking moments particularly the hook the song then takes on a much heavier approach toning down the sonic depth and instead making each individual note from each instrument along with vocals be filled with power all before the third section simply blows everything else out of the water with some of the most perfect use of vocal harmonies and layering i have ever heard with amazing use of mellotron on top of this leading to one of the most powerful moments on the album after this point the majority of the tracks can be put into one of two categories the extremely atmospheric relaxing songs and the ones that are extremely tied to the alternative rock roots of the band subterranean homesick alien lucky and the tourist all fit into this category for me all heavily focusing on capturing particular emotions and tones rather than making a catchy song each sounding simply beautiful with the last 2 closing off the album amazingly with a gradual decrease in any sort of intensity emotional or otherwise until the tourist comes on which is by far the most relaxing song on the album and by the band in general on the other end of the spectrum let down karma police electioneering and no surprises all make for very solid alt rock tunes with a lot of real depth to each track in terms of sound even though the songs themselves seem very simple electioneering is the exception to this having a simple structure but also being very simple and riff driven instead with a fun heavily distorted riff that simply allows one to rock out exit music for a film marks easily the most impactful moment on the album gradually building as everything distorts starting off as a standard track before ending in something incredibly powerful and cathartic as even thom yorkes usual droning vocals feel much more solemn here climbing up the walls takes the atmosphere a step further by not making it depressing as much as eerie bordering on downright terrifying with everything having a scratchy quality to it the song has a very distant isolated feel to it with very sparing use of any sort of sound with the drum beat being incredibly monotonous and simplistic with any other noise being infrequent bringing even more attention to the heavy vocal distortion the other sounds begin coming in as the song progresses constantly making everything feel more claustrophobic with even the beautiful string arrangements simply serving to add more contrast to the unpleasant elements of the song all ending in a chilling scream fitter happier is an odd track to me because while all it provides is creepiness i feel like it ties the album together despite how musically poor it is since there is very little there other than a robotic voice and minimalistic piano this is definitely an incredible album no matter what genre you insist on putting it in it is filled with powerful emotion immersive atmosphere and expert use of a wide variety of techniques subsequently leading to a collection of sonically complex compositions each sounding beautiful and simultaneously impressive when looked at closer radiohead significantly refined and improved their sound from their previous two efforts adding a level of complexity and atmosphere to their alternative rock roots making for a simply incredible album all around best songs paranoid android exit music for a film climbing up the walls karma police worst songs none verdict an extremely good album with a lot of complexity to it masked by a commercial sound making it quite easy to listen to while also being quite interesting to analyse recommended to anyone who will not whine about a somewhat commercial sound,4.50,5227
well i finally got around to listen to this album for the first time after buying it a year or so ago everybody loves this album in the music discussionhipster sphere and i finally see why holy crap on a cracker this album is excellent i have not heard an album that was given the infamous greatest album of all time label and held up to that title since maybe to pimp a butterfly and i love that album so much that it became my manifesto ok computer pulls out all the stops to influence a listener who is looking for a special album it melds its contemporaries and influences from other acts that pushed the envelope of rock music and makes them their own to push that envelope further this one little album caused an explosion in the music world the likes of which the world has not seen since king crimsons in the court of the crimson king not only that it broke my heart and then put it back together numerous times throughout its runtime leaving me so overjoyed that i laughed like i have just proposed to the love of my life and she said yes wow i always start with the production so let us start with it again ok computers mixing at first glance is that standard singer buried in the mix thing that i do not like about more than a few rock records and there is an element of that but once a song like exit music for a film hits i cannot stay mad at this record for long that song and many songs like that are mixed very well in fact thoms vocals are more dynamic than vocalists on a lot of albums i have heard due to this very phenomenon quite fascinatingly and a bit annoyingly thom yorke opts to be another instrument as opposed to leading the charge which is what i would usually prefer but this is ok computer so this album is special partially because all the instruments are crystal clear the digital and analog elements of this album are each handled with care particularly the drums which are a part of the driving force of this albums emotional intensity ok computer balances both digital and analog through its expert sound play from the first few second of airbag we get a melding of acoustic and electronic in the drums this theme is of course found throughout the album we find it on let down with the overbearing synths and the little acoustic guitar in the left corner such thematic brilliance which i will discuss later is not possible without stellar production the production of this record fits every peak and valley radiohead come up with we get a brash style of production on electioneering to fit with the brashness of the instrumentation i mean the guitars and especially those drums are as in your face as radiohead gets on that album and more psychedelic and echoey on songs like subterranean homesick alien there are songs like exit music for a film which are conflicted between warm and cold which are also handled really well from a productions standpoint this record really has it all speaking of having it all the composition of ok computer is incredible there is a conflict between analog and digital on this record and both elements bring it to the fullest extent on this record the synths on this album have a very artificial sound that plays into the themes for example the bridge and especially the ending of let down and the crashing down in karma police there are also little beeps boops and samples throughout ok computer that make this album feel that much more artificial it is hard to come up with good example because an example of this is on nearly every track the noise way in the background of exit music for a film the ringing in lucky the synthetic voices in both aforementioned tracks and the entirety of fitter happier are a few of many examples of the cold digital side of this album but we also get the beautiful acoustic aspects of this album the drums i have already mentioned are excellent the bass adds a nice flavour to each track it is sparse on airbag and is yet somehow more noticeable the pianos are beautiful on karma police particularly the synths can be warm as well such as on subterranean homesick alien the guitar fits well with every song on this album it is clean when it needs to be and explosive on others for a guitar led album the guitar never let us this album be onedimensional there are so many things i could gush on about with this records composition first off i will mention the intricacy of each track there are often so many moving parts to these songs that all fit together so well particularly the synths on subterranean homesick alien that never fail to make me melt each track is beautifully arranged i could go on for another paragraph on the masterpiece that is paranoid android with how seamlessly it transitions from one movement to the other let us just say it got my bohemian rhapsody award for best song with multiple parts in its respective decade for a reason it is an amazing diverse track speaking of diversity ok computer has it all in its composition it has dark songs like exit music for a film absolute bangers like electioneering and everything in between whatever mood you may have ok computer has you covered with this diversity comes the influence of this album it borrows from pink floyd in their hey day as well as a bit of beach boys and the clash i even heard a bit of chick coreas spain a famous jazz song for those who do not know in exit music for a film while taking a leaf from other musical revolutionaries future acts would come along and take a leaf out of radioheads book let down sounds like many altrock songs that would come after particularly snow patrols chasing cars which i loved as a kid when it came out and i still love now as well as influencing more acts i grew up with such as muse the killers and coldplay as such let down as well as a lot of this album feels like a warm hug what really sticks with me about this albums its lyrical content the lyrics themselves are not wordy at all compared to other rate your musicpitchfork darlings cough itaots but radiohead is very effective with what they say on this album enough to make me burst into tears of sheer joy they are delivered by a thom yorke who throws an emotional gauntlet onto the listener while there are times where i cannot understand what thoms singing due in part to the nature of his voice and the production focussing more on vocal dynamic range his voice however follows the tone that each song is going for which adds to each songs potency he sounds beaten down and dejected on certain songs and he has passionate highs as well which i absolutely adore as for lyrical analysis i feel as though this album is more than what people say it is through both the passive and active research i conducted for this album the general consensus was that ok computer was about the dangers of technology and how the machines were taking over and making our lives miserable while there is an element of that this would be a far preachier and therefore far worse album if that were the only thing that it brought to the table my personal analysis is that ok computer is not so much warning us about evil robots and technology taking our jobs but more worried about becoming more machinelike mirroring the technology we created in 1997 and have been creating since ok computer is begging us to not be tricked into thinking that our current fastpaced society is not only the right way to live but the only way to live from the eviction of a neardeath experience in airbag to the bleakness of fitter happier to the blasting of tony blair in electioneering to the closer the tourist literally begging us to slow down and enjoy our lives this album is a lyrical powerhouse that taps into my emotions in more ways than one and really that is all i can ask for from music all my favourite albums do just that in conclusion i wish i listened to this album a lot sooner than i did but better late than never i guess right before i listened to ok computer i felt an enticing aura about it as if it was beckoning me to listen to it now after all the times i have listened to this masterpiece all i can really say is wow i was wowed by how well this album was produced teaching me about the importance of dynamics even if it fits the dreaded rock trope of the singer not sitting atop the mix as the main melody should the album also blends analog and digital together effortlessly creating a sound that balances warm and cold that makes the album unique each track adds a different element to ok computer and enriches it with a wide variety of sounds and emotion every instrument shows up and is incredibly important to these beautifully intricate tracks that are arranged so masterfully that they remind me of what swans would do with to be kind years later speaking of years later this one album caused an alternative rock revolution that i was lucky enough or unlucky enough depending on who you ask to experience in my childhood all this while borrowing sounds from various visionaries of radioheads time which makes ok computer a prime example of how no great albums are an island unto themselves and the importance of experimentation in music i have written all this as a part of my closing paragraph and i have not even gotten into the lyrics yet their lyrics are poignant and tell the story of human dejection in the modern age ok computer argues that if we are not careful our actions will reflect the machines we create to the point where we are indistinguishable from the robots this album reiterates the importance of living in the moment and affirming your life as a human being this album is a crown jewel in rock music history and inspires me to go outside and tell the world that i am indeed a human being and i will live every moment of my life as well as i can it is not the best album of all time in my opinion as to pimp a butterfly exists and has my undying adoration but ok computer is a benchmark in rock history and honestly i can see why people really love this album honestly its not far off from being my favourite either and i hope you will find the time to experience it yourself,5.00,10086
there is not much about ok computer that has not already been said so i do not feel a need to write about its legacy and significance and context and whatnot ok computer is one of those albums that took a really long time to appreciate from the first time i heard it until i would say midaugust of 2018 i really did not get it and it seemed really abstract but some select songs stuck with me between midaugust 2018 to midjanuary 2019 i was in a state of denial of me seriously liking a radiohead album and i tried picking through all of its trivial flaws to justify not giving it a perfect score and saying yeah definitely not their best nah not the best album of the 1990s i gave in this is not the best album of the 1990s though it is probably the most significant i will start with the albums flaws because it is a cracked 10 stars 1 between the outstanding karma police and the haunting climbing up the walls it is clumsy and awkward fitter happier is not bad and it has its place in the loose concept of the album but it would not be a big deal if it was removed it is wellwritten in the sense that it reinforces the modern hysteria and anxiety but some lines are just awkward like a pig in a cage on antibiotics it ends on a dramatic note and then transitions into electioneering one of the bands least charismatic songs that is not bad but extremely underwhelming the worst elements of muse followed this song i guess 2 its ending is underwhelming bouncing back from the aforementioned songs you have two of the albums highest points and then you have two great but not particularly exceptional or high songs i would be fine if this ended with lucky because that could serve as a fantastic closer the line pull me oooouuuuuuuuuuut of the aircrash pull me oooouuuuuuuuut of the lake would work so well if this closed a loose concept album that started with airbag yes there is a difference between a car crash and an airplane crash but still i do not have many flaws of lucky but the tourist kind of plods along as the second longest song on the album but is not that exciting or climactic on its own it is not worth much but it does not offer a cliffhanger or exciting ending to an exceptional album still it is nice and atmospheric 3 sometimes it takes itself a bit too seriously this is not a major flaw because it is an alternative rock album released in the 90s and 90s alt rock borrowed a lot of the excess of the 80s and just condensed it into other areas i avoid or try to avoid using pretentious in critiques of art but the melancholy and futuristic concepts of the album open it up for many of these critiques even if they are not the most valid basically it is not an album i am always in the mood for but when i am in the mood for it it hits like a charm with these flaws aside the rest of the album is perfect if the highs outweigh the lows so be it because they absolutely outweigh the three main flaws above i used to think the middle section was a bit dull but i have come to appreciate that stretch airbag is a humble opener that hints at something greater and futuristic combining some more modern sounds to a standard alternative tune and given what comes after it is very modest and notsotelling this is good on paranoid android radiohead declared themselves the greatest band of their time it is an utterly ridiculous song too i love bohemian rhapsody  i am in love with my car and its bombast playfulness contrast and passagelinking like many do and this song still blew my mind the first time i heard it it is more serious and intense than bohemian and better too like the opener this starts off humble and you would not expect it to be that avantgarde and revolutionary it is acoustic but also spacey and atmospheric the melody is nice and all but it also has that sense of dread and fear to it showing the contrast between a more upbeat sound and an anxious and looming passage as the lyrics grow darker it gets more tense you get a sick guitar solo and then it abruptly switches to a moody atmospheric and anxious passage that is just sick this is the part where it blew my mind the first time i heard it fuck everything about this song is stunning and perfectly put together the last minute and climax is also incredible and this song is where the band declared yeah we are better than you and gave a fyou to the industry and also to the bends the stretch between subterranean homesick alien a definitive indie song title and karma police is outstanding consistent and astonishing karma police was probably the first radiohead song i ever loved and this was at the time where i strongly disliked the band outside of creep 15 step and this a fantastic piano psuedoballad with strong hints of downtempo and trip hop to it amazing how it works out exit music for a film is jawbreaking and whatever film it is for it is sure as hell a dark and surreal film it starts off with guitar chords telling of melancholy and rain and does not get any more positive from there the mellotron and organ and depressed chords do a lot for atmosphere sure but i have noticed that the looped sample playing in the backgroundindistinguishable but presentdoes a lot to make it more abstract and the bass synth helps toothat section of the song is insane let down is probably the most upbeat song here but not exactly positive or happy the jangly guitars over futuristic production are great and the songwriting and arrangements are spoton it is bittersweet and melodic and fits in really well subterranean is fantastic and a nice breath of air coming off the mammoth paranoid android and substantially more positive than exit music climbing up the walls and no surprises are not songs that i instantly liked or fell in love with as said before i used to find the middle stretch to be a bit weak fuck me because if climbing up the walls is not the perfect song for when you have reached rock bottom and do not know where to go or if you should ever both climbing up see what i did there then what is jesus is that song haunting or what while electioneering preceded it with spooky samples sounding like the gates were just opened and began with a riff out the door this starts off spacey and somber with colins downtempo bass and the looped sample the distorted vocals are sick i cannot tell you how much i love the production on the album no surprises always reminded me of let down in how it is disguised as an upbeat breath of air but the lyrics still resonate with the rest of the album i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxide is pretty telling of the 21st century the entire first verse for that matter should not go over peoples heads as easily as it does but hey when it starts off with that soft melody like it is a damn rem song i can understand why it does also it sounds like he is signing salaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad instead of sileeeeeeeeeeeeeeeence never was the best vocalist in the world yeah i think all of that beats the three aforementioned flaws here i guess it is the definitive college rock album and it came out 22 years ago and it is still as relevant as its successor kid a which one is better i honestly do not know both mean a lot to me but if i did not revisit kid a and come to realize how amazing it is i do not know if i would have checked out the rest of radioheads discography i have listened to this so many times since august though as an album this works incredibly well but even on their own most of the songs here work quite well paranoid android is my personal favorite song from the bands wide discography just because of how mindblowing it was the first time i heard it in march 2018 it is still wild it is also my pick for the best song of the 1990s because no other song was quite as ambitious and eclectic as that karma police is also comfortably in my top 50 songs of all time and exit music and climbing up the walls are in heavy rotation fuck i do not know why i waited so long to admit to loving this thank you rym 1010 highlights check track ratings or just read the review,5.00,8048
ok computer is a wonderful exploration of the modern first world society radiohead analyses in depth and gives their opinion on the divide in power superficiality and feelings of rejection from society all whilst creating a highly atmospheric and emotional masterpiece that is ever relevant and meaningful as humanity succumbs to madness,5.00,337
i am currently listening through all of the toprated albums on rym in order and figured why not pen a couple of sentences as i do for my own benefit later radioheads ok computer is very familiar to me as i was already a fan back in the 90s before it came out and even though with the benefit of hindsight i no longer really think of it as the goat or maybe even as the best radiohead album anymore i get why it commonly gets top ranking in charts like these this feels like the first album of the internet age there is something otherworldly about this album that is so hard to pinpoint and even harder to recreate they took the brooding pop charm of the bends and lifted into a cloud like alternative rock was having an outofbody experience radiohead are simultaneously the mystics guiding the spiritual journey and the emts on the scene doing chest compressions and injecting cortisone they are the night shift hospital janitors watching the body roll in on a gurney they are subterranean homesick aliens making home movies for the folks back home in any case ok computer felt like a sea change in rock music and i get why it is still lauded to this day favorite tracks exit music let down no surprises,4.50,1204
believe me i have tried with this record i have tried so hard i have listened in depth multiple times trying to figure out why this record is rated so high i cannot i really cannot therefore my review will be simple karma police is a good song,3.00,243
ok computer radiohead 1997 a landmark album of the 90s and one of my favorites of the decade it was a huge leap from radioheads first album pablo honey and perfected the themes and experimentation they were toying with in their sophomore album the bends many people listen to this album and see it as nothing more than a really good alternative rock album as they fail to truly delve into what makes the album stand out it is true radiohead did stick to somewhat typical rock musical structures while still have the transitions and experimentation reminiscent that of progressive rock however that part of their vision would not be fully realized until kid a their lyrical content and eerie foreshadowing of the 21st century are what is key here they somehow are able to encapsulate the feeling of postmodern society with all of our technological advancements and things like social media when back in that day it was just slow massive computers that could at must run doom along with the lyrics a large portion of the youth in the 90s really had not listened to much music that surpassed conventional rock structures and on ok computer radiohead often step out of those boundaries the song that everyone likes to point out and with good reason is paranoid android the song features a fairly run of the mill acoustic session in the beginning with thom yorkes signature vocals after two verses and a chorus the chorus is played a second time however it does not break back into the acoustic playing from the beginning instead the mood slightly shifts and thom whines a melody behind the new guitar chords when he starts to sing the lyrics the tone is noticeably darker an electric guitar shocks in with a power chord and the song just goes balls to the wall with a guitar solo and some whammy bar whacking it then calms down into another acoustic section before ending with another explosive electric distortion and effect filled solo with distorted scream vocals in the background the innovative musical content with the lyrics describing a life of loneliness and isolation that would come to be the lives of many teenagers in the 21st century make this an album that will never be forgotten and will always be beloved i give it a solid 910 favorite tracks paranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police,4.50,2314
i am not going to waste your time here this album is stunning and powerful and i am sure you have already heard this a shining achievement for rock music and one of my personal favorite albums in my opinion this blows kid a out of the water the 1990s greatest album favorite tracks let down paranoid android no surprises subterranean homesick alien the tourist climbing up the walls least favorite tracks none,5.00,409
i am planning on reviewing the top ten albums on this site and first is ok computer the bends started to show radiohead as a great band that was something special and ok computer did nothing but confirm it the way radiohead combines electronic elements with alternative rock in grandiose fashion is pretty great tracks airbag this song has thom telling the story of how an airbag saved someone is life after getting into a car crash the melodies of this song always get stuck in my head and the intro to this song is really eye catching ear catching i do not know well this song is a really great intro to the album paranoid android another incredibly catchy song on the album i love the production build up to when he says you do not remember you do not remember why do not you remember my name most of the song shows thom being bitter against someone likely spoiled and greedy saying ambition makes you look pretty ugly kicking screaming gucci little piggy lol subterranean homesick alien i really the hazy dreamy atmosphere of the production on this song in this song thom theorizes about the extraterrestrial with an almost childlike curiosity love how the drums kick in for the chorus exit music for a film this may be my favorite song off the whole album the song may not be the most bold and upfront song on the album but the emotion that thom puts into this song makes this the saddest radiohead song i have heard so far i love how the production crescendos in the fourth verse the lyrics are very heartfelt and talk about wanting to escape away from troubled you are being faced with let down the lyrics on this song are some of the best on the album to me it is talking about depression the bug being crushed a metaphor for all of lifes baggage weighing down negatively on your mood the line bouncing back and one day i am going to grow wings i feel feeds into the theme of escapism present in the album karma police hot take but i believe that this is the worst song on the album its still a good song but i have always found the verses a bit annoying and the production and lyrics have never seemed quite up to par with the rest of the songs chorus and outro are pretty catchy though fitter happier definitely a weirder song on the album which features a robot from the future talking about humans and what they should be like the production behind this has a certain creepiness to it that is hard to shake off electioneering after a series of subtle songs ending in fitter happier electioneering crashes in unexpectedly in contrast with most of the rest of the album this song is noisy and catchy as hell underrated and easily one of my favorites from the album the riffs and cowbell on this album are very fun climbing up the walls this song both succeeds in being creepy and catchy at the same time and i love how thom sings the chorus and how distorted the production gets with the outro and thom basically screaming climbing up waaals no surprises unlike climbing up walls this song has a very calming atmosphere that is difficult to describe it reminds me of a mother singing a lullaby to a child and reassuring them that everything is going to be alright the song has very sad lyrics that keep up the empty and depressive theme on the album a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal you look so tired unhappy the production is not grandiose but very calming and beautiful in subtle ways lucky this song has one of the most alien sounding and grand choruses on the album this song lyrically has a positive and optimistic theme around ignoring the negative influences and working to better yourself the tourist this song kind of reminds me of parts of dark side of the moon for whatever reason i really like thoms vocals on this song he has a way of conveying emotions of sadness and melancholy like not many others i feel that the album would not be anywhere as close to how great as it is if it was sang by anyone else date released 6161997 genres alternative rock art rock best tracks exit music for a film electioneering climbing up the walls airbag paranoid android no surprises lucky worst tracks karma police rating high 910 incredible album and despite how much people overate radiohead on this site this album deserves the praise it has gotten from forward thinking themes of dystopian society to themes of depression and feeling like an outsider this album makes a statement this album sonically sounds from another universe as it uses key changes and unique time signatures in its own way the fusion of art rock with electronic elements was unique and influential for the albums for years to come give this album a few listens if it does not click right away its amazing work that is it for my shitty review if any of the themes i have said around the album are incorrect my bad its just what i got from the music,4.50,4894
what is up rym it is been awhile since i wrote a review here and i quite like the whole bulletpoint format i am not sure if it fits what i am going to put here but i am going to use it anyways because writing formats are just a construct anyways a it is been a good 45 years now since the peak musichunting part of my life a combination of disillusionment with music school and a host of other factors kind of pulled me away from focusing on music as much as i used to 2 the past few days i have been desperately searching for some artist or album to hit me with that spark i used to feel in the early 2010s the inspiration and fire of listening to spiritualizeds ladies and gentlemen for the first time not finding it i decided to revisit this album which i had listened to nearly a decade ago but had nearly left my mind it was not listening to it for the first time but it was a close as anybody could get  i am not sure if this album scratches that itch i am not sure if any music really can anymore maybe i have been around the block one too many times this album is innovative but i find myself thinking about the chord progressions the small harmonic surprises the influences from nearly every style of music we have seen since the 1950s the fuzzy bass tone on exit music the prominent piano on karma police it is like i have lost my music innocence i desperately want to be able to listen to this album outside the context of knowing where it came from or the kind of music it would spawn  while i find myself able to identify a great portion of what is going on here the album still takes me by surprise at every turn and therein lies what i love about it every nook and cranny of this album has been considered and if there was something that could be added or removed to remove the album those things have been consequently added or removed  calling something perfect is a pretty hack move but i am just not creative enough to be able to think of a way to make this album better i am not sure if anybody is rated as a 45 for the time being as i only rate albums as 5s on secondary listenings and considerations i imagine this one will have no problem crossing that bridge though,4.50,2189
yeah there is this little underground band i know called radiohead they wrote this album it is like really good it is probably uh i do not know the best album of all time or you know something to that effect it is a shame that it is almost required to preface this thing with a disclaimer about how you think it is actually not the greatest album of all time truly the hottest take but when you have been the number one highest rated album on a popular music forum for years now there is not much you can do in the outset of a review than to let people know that you are not going to completely suck off the artist and their work that being said ok computer has become such a legendary work that it is still talked about today it still feels fresh and the messy scraps of recordings that were produced during its development somehow managed to crack 375 stars on this site this is definitely radioheads most celebrated work with only kid a competing but this one is certainly seen as the more accessible of the two and with good reason i myself was not overly fond of this album the first time i heard it at the age of 17 and i had to listen to it three times over the course of about a year before i really enjoyed it it is more accessible than some of radioheads other work but that does not mean that it is not at all challenging to listen to the first go around but hey at the time my music taste had not really extended far beyond classic rock so is it the greatest album of all time could be i am not going to argue that it is as it is not even my favorite radiohead work but i think that it is certainly worth a good bit of the praise that is heaped upon it the opening riff of airbag is perhaps my favorite introduction to any album ever i am not saying the entire song maintains this level of aweinspiration but everything before the drum track kicks in is so goddamn cool sounding that i still let out an audible and excited oh when it comes up on my phone since it is not set against anything and is right at the beginning the riff just comes out like it is the heaviest thing in all of music and i adore it when the song picks up the phrase wall of sound comes to mind in a way that i do not associate with a lot of the other music i listen to there is so many different sounds happening and yet none of it becomes overwhelming to the point that it is just noise yorkes performance on this song is nothing particularly special but it is serviceable although as an aside i would like to say that the lyric an angel at my door as it was revealed on the leaked minidiscs is far better than the jackknifed juggernaut line they ended up using on the official release this song also does a great job of setting up the albums dichotomy of reliance on technology versus the fear of technology in ways that are not one hundred percent apparent on the first lesson but are more than obvious each time you revisit it my big issue with this song lies in the instrumental breaks which i do not find nearly as interesting as the writers must have still though this is a great album opener a 45 147 listens i think that paranoid android does a much better job of capturing the style and spirit of this record than the introductory song and also has much more thrust to it as well i mean this song is just fantastic the music video still does not make a lick of sense to me but that does not detract from the song itself in anyway this is one of yorkes best and most memorable performances on the album and perhaps in the entire radiohead discography his effortless falsetto throughout the song is spectacular no matter which of the three distinct sections of the song he traverses the first section of this song is a great slice of rock any way you look at it the lyrics can come across as somewhat nonsensical but the huge drop on you do not remember you do not remember is such a wellearned moment but still can come as a bit of a jolting surprise if you are not paying close attention the bread and butter of this song however is the middle rain down section of the song it maintains the percussion in a more slow rock style while the other instruments drop out in favor of these ah vocalizations layered heavily on top of each other all the while yorke delivers a harrowing melodic performance atop the surgicallyprecise harmonies this bit is one of my favorite moments on the entire album and comes so soon as if to motivate one to keep listening just when the initial shock of this slow chanting section has subsided it jolts back to the rock feel but with considerably more energy than it offered prior to the second section the third section is a great outro harkening back to radioheads work on the bends which is always a joy to revisit in my book this song earns high high marks it is six and a half minutes long and does not feel that long at all so it clearly earns a 55 255 listens subterranean homesick alien has grown on me within the past twoish months while i initially found this song lacking in substance and viewed it as a lesstalented little brother to paranoid android i have come around to enjoying it as a bridge between that song and the next it is a necessary step to calm the listener after the high octane ending of its last song i have also come to appreciate the narrative spun in the lyrics of this song making the words of this piece some of my favorite on the album as a whole the concept of an alien coming to earth and feeling nervous and isolated looking down on the collective fear of the human race is such a great topic for a song yorke is an expert at writing songs about isolation and being a wallflower this song really runs into problems with how repetitive it is as if they had only one idea that they could derive the four minutes from particularly the chorus of the song is rather bland to me still this is just a small nick on an otherwise great atmospheric piece the song still narrowly meets a 45 to me 110 listens i think most people who were not really fond of this album on their first listen like myself still found immense enjoyment in exit music for a film this song contextualizes the windingdown that began with track 3 starting with this gentle solo guitar line and barely stretching beyond that for a good bit of the song yorkes performance in this song is fantastic perhaps his eeriest effort in this whole collection save for one other track climbing up the walls the song builds slightly in the second verse making you think it will go somewhere but when it goes back down in the third verse it convinces you otherwise which is what makes it so jawdropping when the sound explodes in the fourth verse i remember being floored by this song and it still gets me every now and again definitely a goosebumpsinspiring drop i love how my expectations for the song to come back down at the end of this verse were denied and substituted with yorke going up further and wailing on we hope your words and wisdom choke you the magic of this song is hard to articulate in writing but anyone who listens to it should be able to agree with why i am giving it a 55 326 listens directly out of the last masterpiece comes another one in the form of let down this one is by far my favorite on the album and i am glad that so many people have also come around to this state of mind in recent years there is a bit of an inside joke amongst radiohead fans now that let down is an underrated masterpiece shout out to rletdownappreciation you are doing gods work i digress let down is undoubtedly the most pop rock endeavor on the album and perhaps one of radioheads most accessible works i was surprised to find that they do not often play this one live because it is too complicated when i read that i took a closer listen to the song and began to understand towards the end philip goes absolutely nuts on the drums in a way that i feel like i will never fully be able to comprehend throughout the song the drum track is one of my favorite bits  i often find myself beating along to it with my hands when i listen to the song it is unique for a song that sounds so much like a pop rock song this song is also where i think that ok computer begins to revel in the beauty of its own depressing world which is expanded upon in the tenth track this song is undoubtedly a bummer an anthem about being disappointed and dissatisfied and yet it delivers the most touching bridge in any song i have ever heard yorkes falsetto on the repeated you know where you are over the chorus at the end is absolute musical ecstasy the song is five and half minutes and feels like a standard three minute banger i have nothing but praise for this song it is one of my top 3 radiohead songs ever written making it an obvious 55 song 677 listens and speaking of absolute bangers here comes karma police i believe after creep this is radioheads most wellknown song and i am mostly okay with that let down is better but whatever the groove in this song is undeniable from the very first measure the bass line rocks the percussion is powerful the piano fills in the chorus are chilling radiohead has described two songs on this album as funny and this is one of them the other being paranoid android not funny as in interesting but funny as in haha leading me to believe that this band is comprised of some of the most hilariously not funny people on the planet  this songs outro consists of yorke repeating for a minute there i lost myself is not that just hilarious perhaps they were being ironic and the sarcasm went over my head but at any rate it still amuses me a great deal also another note about the lyrics being changed originally they had arrest this girl she stares at me as if she owns the world and changed it to arrest this girl her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill which is a way worse line regardless this song still absolutely goes off the only knock against it and it is not even really the songs fault is that it is less inventive and less interesting than the song that comes right before it this song is definitely on the high end of a 45 for me 266 listens it is hard to count fitter happier as a song at all if you count it as one it is certainly not a good one however it is crucial to understanding this album as this is the point at which the switch is flipped and the dystopic nature of the latter half is overtly established you definitely do not skip this song when you give the record a full listen even though its uncomfortable atmosphere is almost suffocating many of my friends hate this song as it gives them severe anxiety i think it accomplishes exactly what it needs to  it tells the listener to prepare for a new tone rather than being about the depressing state of society the second half will be about how nightmarish it will become if we let technology supersede the human element i love the piano and background noise of this song and i am very glad they released it on the oknotok cassette tape in 2017 it is almost laughably grim i will say that maybe fitter happier comes across as a bit overthetop kind of onthenose there is no subtlety to it but perhaps that is the point as a song on its own it is definitely a 15 but as a part of a whole it is at least a 35 101 listens it took me so long to figure out that the beginning of electioneering was a cage rattling which is a nice touch to connect it to the final line of fitter happier a pig in a cage on antibiotics people have suggested that radiohead should have replaced electioneering with the song lift from the oknotok rerelease but i could not disagree more not only does it eliminate the narrative through line that the song shares with fitter happier lift does not fit at all here electioneering tells a crucial part of the story of this album regarding a borderline hostile takeover of a government whereas lift is about i think drug addiction completely different ballparks even though i would rather listen to lift instead of electioneering at any given time however this song is definitely the most straight up rockandroll song on the album but in a way that makes it generic i also do not find the mixing to be great on this song as there are harmonies going on that are barely exposed and easy to miss even on repeated listens this is certainly the most overtly political song this work has to offer and the most cookiecutter in a sense but it is no way bad i fully appreciate what it contributes to beginning the second half even though this album falls into the trap that i described on my review of in rainbows it starts out very strong then somewhat wanes in the second and then ends on a high note to retroactively trick you into thinking every song was amazing this song is not amazing  it is just good a solid 35 109 listens if there were one song that was meant to describe the entirety of ok computer it would have to be climbing up the walls this piece perfectly captures a feeling of unease the pitcheddown drums the slow build the odd stretches of grating noises and most of all yorkes performance i would say that this song would fall flat on its face without the vocal track being performed layered mixed and altered in the way that it is the effect on one of yorkes voice makes him sound like a demented robot singing directly into your ears and it is unsettling as hell since the song is supposed to be an aural representation of paranoia it works like a charm yorkes scream at the very end of the song is absolutely flawless in its ability to convey the panic the only knock i have against this song is that it spends a significant portion being good enough the song is about five minute long and really only grabs me when there is a minute and a half left of course this moment would not be as effective without the build up but i guess i am impatient because i cannot honestly say that i thoroughly enjoy this song however it is a great song for instilling dread in the listener and a great descriptor of ok computer as a whole despite my personal issues with it it still gets a 45 116 listens i love no surprises love it love it love it perhaps it is because it reminds me more of the first half of this album than the second half it seems much more akin to let down than it does to climbing up the walls i adore how this song once again relishes in the curious beauty of the depressing dystopia this album so vividly paints the song feels light and floaty but the lyrics are grim and unrelenting the words are littered with numerous references to suicide a hyperappreciation of what we would consider mundane and vague platitudes delivered with an absolutely hollow attitude courtesy of thom yorke such a pretty house and such a pretty garden awakens something in me for reasons i cannot explain at all i also highly recommend the version from the leaked minidiscs with an alternate performance pitched a half step down i may almost prefer this version to the official released version but i acknowledge that even this half step difference somewhat destroys the delicately crafted beauty that the initial release form exudes just a fantastic piece all around it is a 55 597 listens if you do not count fitter happier as a song which i do not then lucky is my least favorite part of this album it is incredibly low energy and although this may be intentional it does not work for me here save for it is going to be a glorious day yorke fails to arouse any significant emotions from me during this song and it feels longer than it is perhaps i am just an idiot but i also fail to see how this song fits into the overall arc of ok computer this songs structure and buildup is at best a poor mans climbing up the walls it does not ruin the album not by a damn sight but it does not really add anything either if you were going to replace any song here i would definitely say this should be the primary candidate man of war would fit excellently and since lucky does not seem to have any bearing on the album as whole lift would substitute in here fine since it too does not relate to the rest of the songs maybe it is too harsh but lucky is a 25 at best for me 103 listens i have seen a lot of disdain for the tourist as a closing track for this album and i have never understood why i think it is fantastic a slow gloomy rock is a great note for radiohead to end on this song makes me visualize myself driving down a long empty road at sunset this is another great performance from yorke in my opinion as it really motivates me to wail out the chorus with him also love the rhythmic breakdown of the word idiot each guitar solo has a huge weight that grounds the otherwise ethereal feeling of the piece i also feel like this is a satisfying conclusion to the overall narrative of the record as it evokes imagery of a passerby in the ruins of a toppled collapsed society as listeners we do not know what specifically led to this we get fleeting images of it in lucky but there will never be an answer i think it is a great thematic choice rather than stating that a certain chain of events in a technologyled society will lead to its downfall radiohead postulates that it does not matter that we will always end up where the tourist describes the length is a bit bothersome and it is certainly not the best that this album has to offer but it is still a solid to high 45 no holds barred 376 listens this album is great there is a reason it is the highest rated on rym there is a reason it is often hailed as the greatest album of all time it has a very consistent narrative without it being musical theatre the songs are memorable the instrumentation is unique and it was a great commentary on the world of 1997 at the turn of the millennium many people will never like this album many people fall in love immediately it was something of a slow burn for me personally but i do not think my admiration for what radiohead created with this record will ever fade if this was the time in music history that rock music started to die then this was a great sendoff all in all ok computer is a 455 the first half is significantly stronger than the second half but the second half never gets irritating or unpleasant to listen to,4.50,18166
ah here we are one of the most acclaimed rock albums of all time ok computer marks radioheads official transformation into an experimental force that would impact music forever it is generally considered to be the most popular radiohead album amongst fans and critics neither its popularity nor its acclaim are unwarranted this album deserves every bit of praise it gets ok computer hits the ground running with airbag right from the first note you can tell this is not the same radiohead from pablo honey or the bends gone are the days of grunge and acoustic guitar here thom yorke sings about being born again after a car accident we can only surmise that this track is not only about yorkes rebirth but also the rebirth of radiohead as i have said earlier ok computer is a whole nother beast from the bands last two albums paranoid android is an experience the track was written after thom yorke had an unpleasant experience in a bar and the lyrics unambiguously reflect his absolute disdain for society he is a miserable depressed individual and he makes this clear when i am king  you will be first against the wall  with your opinion  which is of no consequence at all subterranean homesick alien is another track from the perspective of someone who feels alienated from society here rather than merely railing against society like in paranoid android yorke wishes an alien species would abduct him and take him anywhere else he voices his complaints against a heavily electronic instrumental one of many such instrumentals throughout the album ok computers entire atmosphere is defined by its melancholy electronic elements as the world it seeks to create is one of coldness and depression i do not care much for exit music for a film although it is an enjoyable track but let down may be my personal favorite radiohead song read this verse transport motorways and tramlines  starting and then stopping  taking off and landing  the emptiest of feelings  disappointed people clinging on to bottles  and when it comes it is so so disappointing in just six bars thom yorke manages to perfectly describe the cold robotic world depicted on the cover of the album and over the course of the songs five minutes he gives the performance of his life i would make the argument that the refrain leading into the final chorus is peak radiohead nowhere else on any of the previous or subsequent albums will you hear thom yorke pour such emotion into his words his already impressive singing is backed up by the seamless transition from refrain to chorus the first few tracks of ok computer are among radioheads best but the remainder of the album while great never quite reaches those heights again karma police is another track where thom yorke complains about society this time calling out specific individuals eg a man who talks in maths and a girl with a hitler hairdo and saying that this is what you get at the end of the song yorke reminds himself that he too could fall victim to karma and should probably stop calling for the universe to punish other people fitter happier fits the robotic borderlinedystopian world that ok computer seeks to establish especially due to its haunting instrumental but it feels unnecessary considering that radiohead has never been a band to stuff their albums with filler electioneering is one of the albums more political cuts and has some impressive chords throughout climbing up the walls is arguably the strongest track on the second half of the lp strings and drums as well as the screams at the end effectively create a dark atmosphere as yorke sings about mental illness and either way you turn  i will be there  open up your skull  i will be there  climbing up the walls album closer the tourist is significant to me mainly because of the final verse hey man slow down slow down  idiot slow down slow down  hey man slow down slow down  idiot slow down slow down imagine this verse is from the perspective of someone about to get into a car accident then remember what the opening track of the album is about everything comes full circle ok computer should be required listening for not just rock fans but for music lovers in general it is not a perfect album very few are but it is still an excellent piece of art,4.00,4256
i had heard this album long before i discovered this website and i was genuinely baffled to see this is the number one album i assumed it was a popular enough album hence why i tried it out to begin with but not this popular my initial impression with this album is that apart from kind of liking first two tracks the rest of it bored me nowadays i do not quite dislike it as i used to but it has not grown on me say the way joy division has joy division i was not massive on when i first heard them and i have grown to love them but radiohead on the other hand i largely still do not get much enjoyment out of their discography i do like this more now but i still do not get why its such a highly regarded album when i find it to be a kind of mixed bag overall i still really enjoy the first two tracks but it the rest of it varies for me subterranean is decent the kind of mysterious eerie sound is pretty good i guess exit music on the other hand is a dreadfully dull song too long and meandering let down is a decent ballady song with a catchy hook also i can say i like no surprises karma police and electioneering electioneering is a welcome throwback to the good bends album there is also an annoying 2 minute robot interlude because reasons the rest of it is not bad but just does little for me at the end of the day this is an ok album which is kind of interesting in what it does with the alternative rock thing and a few good songs but nothing exceptional except perhaps airbag which is an amazing eerie opener and i wish the rest of the album when for that kind of sound i have never been massive on thom yorkes vocals and its the next album where i find it to be even more grating but here i can overlook it in places because there is fair amount of good riffs and interesting sounds though not enough for me overall,3.00,1829
ok computer is almost always referred to as a perfect record disproving this proves to be an arduous task when you take a look at the track listing songs like paranoid android karma police no surprises and lucky would be enough to make this album more lovable and memorable than it is contemporaries but then we also get songs like airbag subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down and climbing up the walls that are like reinforcements to the more famous songs it is easy to see why this record is one of the most beloved albums of all time the song immediately starts with a rockthemed song giving us familiarity and comfort after which we are launched in the jerky glitchy paranoid android this 3 sectored song sends you on a sonic roller coaster one section containing tension one where the tension is released followed by a sombre reflection on the tension then returning to the anger of the second section the guitar work is absolutely immaculate seeing jonny perform this live is invigorating the energy with which he performs is mesmerising we are then slowly let down by subterranean homesick alien this is a sonically dreamy song the lyrics of this song describe a mans desire to leave behind the world and humanity as he seeks alien life he sees the world from an outside perspective and through this discovers that people are uptight he dreams about being abducted and wants to become friends with the aliens this song is all about loneliness and isolation and seeking an alternative when they first started to record ok computer radiohead were asked to write a song for romeo and juliet as a result they produced exit music for a film this is a beautiful song it opens with just thom and an acoustic then strings are added which brings a whole new feeling it adds tension especially with the chords used after we hear what sounds like children in a playground screaming one reviewer vinyl rewind described this sound as a memory which is superbly accurate in my opinion the last a major then fades into let down a powerful song that addresses thoms life travelling for what felt like an endless amount of time everything in the first verse addresses travel and the isolation that thom felt from this this is the main theme of the song during the bends tour they spent most of the time travelling which left thom feeling dissociated and dejected in an everchanging world let down is thoms answer to this and in the tour for ok computer thoms isolation and burn out got worse and worse the last a major transitions nicely into karma police this is one of radioheads most championed and famous songs and there is little to be said about the song now everyone knows that this song is immensely fantastic in its execution the lack of a definitive chorus helps this song flow effortlessly rightly so this has become a staple in radiohead live setlists usually being the last song they play as a homage to the fans this is followed by the experimental fitter happier this is a short monologue that lays out the flaws of modern society in a texttospeech voice this acts as an interval song whilst still allowing radiohead to delve deeper into their desire to express their political opinions suddenly we are kicked back into the record with electioneering this is ok computers political song thom criticises the government overtop distorted guitars the song is finished with a solo reminiscent of the bends we are then sent straight back down with climbing up the walls a song centred around thoms experiences whilst working in a mental hospital which definitely contextualises the song this is easily the most harrowing and dark song on the album the scream at the end is perfection next we turn to no surprises another song that radiohead fans have fallen in love with this song is like a melancholic lullaby a suicide note wrapped in a nursery rhyme the lyrics are a person wishing to die slowly and ignorant to their death by carbon monoxide poisoning the line i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxide clearly show this and it definitely makes the chorus more saddening as if the person who wrote this has disabled their smoke alarm in an effort to die bereft of the knowledge of their death lucky was the first song written for the album it was written for the help album by brian eno the music transition from the verse to the chorus is so uplifting going from a minor to a major this makes the song so much more enticing the fact that the last chord does not resolve is a perfect setup for the last song the tourist this is an underlooked song in my opinion it was barely played live however it is one of the most emotional songs on the album it was inspired by a man that thom saw in france rushing around trying to see every landmark possible it highlights our desire to discover new things and the proposed importance of creating memories or the ability to say i have seen this and yet never living in the moment which is the exact point of the holiday  to get away from it all to these people thom says hey man slow down in conclusion ok computer is an album about the isolation thom felt at the time as well as how society was being impacted by the advancement of technology however the most important theme is loneliness this is an album that is both sonically and lyrically rich and nearperfect it is an essential listen,5.00,5370
ok computer was my first ever listened album of radiohead i love it especially paranoid androidkarma policelucky as a 13 years kid these stuffs are astonishing fuzzy solos in paranoid android madness white noise in karma police sheer sadness in no surprises i am 23 now i still god damn love this album  it is one of the greatest album ever but as a long time radiohead follower  i prefer their later works more as i grow up in rainbows it still feels perfect after years and years hail to the thief perfect combination of what in radioheads mind when putting all radioheads albums together ok computer is eclipsed by other albums of radiohead at least for me 45,4.00,662
jesus christ shut the fuck up no album has given us as much childish hipstergeek bickering as this one and for a while there this album was used so often as some sort of status symbol or punchline that it is now practically impossible to say anything about it that might be observant or useful me i do not have much connection to this album any more not on a personal level  it is too clinical too humorless too knowingly cathartic for me i would rather listen to kid a or even the bends any day though i acknowledge that ok computer is the better album but to deny the artistry and talent involved or to deny what it meant whether you want to admit it or not it may well be the last full length album before my beautiful dark twisted fantasy that actually felt like it truly signified something as a whole culturally would be idiotic just because you have tired of something for personal reasons does not mean that its objective aesthetic value has withered is it really so crazy that i can listen to the countermelodies in paranoid android and acknowledge the song as an extremely accomplished piece of work a goddamn suite for globalized genx corptocracy anxieties while at the same time acknowledging that i would never choose to listen to it again is it so crazy to appreciate karma police as a fantastic blend of sexy sadie and where is my mind while admitting that  like the album  it is just too goddamn clinical for me to hear without feeling slightly nauseated apparently so christ is ok computer the new masondixon line despite impenetrabilities and insecurities that can get pretty annoying if you dwell on them and frankly could never be as aweinspiring as the more universalist statements of earlier eras in popular music ok computer is ironically  of course ironically it was the 90s so without an obviously cynical bent the generation might have gotten fussy before naptime  is actually despite its concepts of an emotionless paranoid plane pretty outdoorsy music the summer airs of subterranean homesick alien easily my favorite song on the album and the only one that i would leave on if i shuffled to it fond memories of july evenings hanging out on my parents roof choruses soaring forward with blips and crunched guitars and warm keyboards all zipping round like hovercars it reminds me of bowieenos a new career in a new town in that way the cello in airbag sly lamb lies down on broadway of an opener which nobody ever mentions disguising the seeping guitar that comes in on in a deep deep sleep the way exit music for a film sounds chilly enough to evoke dry stagnant winter and is made even creepier by samples of a cheery beach things are always scarier and more disturbing when they are placed against a normalized background that is what makes the longoverdue scream at the end of climbing up the walls hit harder than a usual scream considering all the songs that preceded it the clearskied anesthetic limbo of no surprises the childlike harmonic slides in the last third of karma police that expanding synth in climbing up the walls that sounds like bubbling digital lava undiminished by the addition of dramatic strings the rocking spirited guitars of electioneering that are such an excellent kickstart into the albums final third as it follows the kind of interlude that is just right for a record like this clearly an interlude but one that does not cut the atmosphere short and in fact draws you deeper in to the sequencing and that twinkling guitar part in let down  you know the one  just basks in its own airborne bliss  for as long as it can anyway nave enough to think these feelings could be eternal but smart enough to be able to briefly set aside the angst in favor of a new sensation sounds like people falling in love is what it sounds like the dirty little secret of radiohead is that none of these guys can play their instruments all that well for all jonny greenwoods needs to prove himself as some sort of classicallyinformed auteur matching him perfectly with paul thomas anderson cinematographer with an empty head his work on paranoid android is about as close as he is ever come to proving himself as a virtuoso on his own instrument and even there it is mostly from his interplay with ed obrien who is probably a little underrated as an effects guy plus a lot of phil selways drum parts sound kind of samey do not they and as for thom yorkelook he is a genius singer radioheads achievement in updating progressiveartrock for the alternative rockelectronic music era is analogous to rem another band with a genius singer and a band but who instead updated the byrds for the postpunk era side note both rem and radiohead have a similar limitation which is that almost all their good songs are deadly serious yorkes singing style is consistent in all of his performances like a disgruntled mutant stunted in growth with his every physical and psychological feature horribly gnarled and twisted seething with resentment too weak to do anything but consumed with a desire to tear you apart it is a powerful unique style and deserves tremendous respect but it is also unhealthy the world is not as bad as that and singing as though it were is defeatist i remember when my parents first got a colorimage internetequipped computer back in the late 90s some longgone compaq i was so awed when my dad brought it home and first started it up  complete with enos entrance music  and witnessing its damnnear otherworldly processing of information there could have been entire universes of electric color encased in that box for all i knew i was excited and yet i did not really care for more than a minute or two  i just wanted to play around with it to my pampered geny mind the computer was just another tool albeit a tool that i could not understand and would probably never understand here in 2018 i still have no idea how the fuck these things work or how they were ever made to it is embarrassing that such a simple point has been lost in among all the bickering but ok computer is still the closest a rock band has come to capturing the manner and feeling of a personal computer just listen to the first 20 seconds of the album and those clean cold cuts of the drums the terrifying possibilities of where this stuff could take us and the glorious realization that we would even been able to come this far in the first place for all the lyrics from ok computer thatve wormed their ways into the alternative lexicon  kicking squealing gucci little piggy let down and hanging around for a minute there i lost myself slow down idiot  for me the most beautiful one barely gets mentioned even though it sumsup everything this album stood for and everything the digital boom still stands for in this decadent young century scrolling up and downi am born again but yknow it is all in the title okay computer i am okay computer are you okay computer okay computer  whatever you say a,0.50,6922
to be perfectly clear radiohead is the single most overrated band i have heard in my life in my opinion if there was not so much hype around it i feel like i might have been able to just ignore them dull lyrics that explore dull and played out topics drowned out and barely understandable vocals instrumentals that are really only lightly experimental and a little bit above average in terms of how pleasant they are these things hold back the band a lot on all their albums while not all are present in full force here it is still enough to make it barely good overall the album is very mediocre goes nowhere and fast and is hardy the patron saint of music everyone says it is it is a high quality album i give it that but a high quality version of pretentious uninspired altrock is still pretentious uninspired altrock,0.50,820
nb my score relates only to notok bonus disc not the original album which is obviously a classic although overrated what the fuck are these bonus cuts this is the most uninspired collection of radiohead songs ever released not a single one good or remarkable track on the whole cd seriously i have never been radiohead fan that much to check out their bsides and all but i was shocked at how poor and bland these recordings are plus the sound and production of these songs has almost nothing to do with ok computer they are simply not even remotely in the same vein these should not have been released at all i am going to,1.00,622
my film teacher once described the perfect movie as a blt everything works together to make a perfect whole just the right amount of everything i am convinced that the same applies for the perfect album and in a lot of ways ok computer is that blt one of few sure there are definitely a few others that are blt albums everything working together but ok computer i would say is one of them later on in that class he was describing you could not add anything else or else it would throw it off i mean it has a creamy aspect being the mayo a crunch being the lettuce a sweet aspect being the tomato and a savory aspect being the bacon i asked him though what about avocado because i personally enjoy avocado on a blt and he told me that you could not it would just be adding another creamy which would throw off the balance sure a normal blt is great but i still desire something that packs more of a punch even if it does in fact throw off balance perhaps kid a is that blt with avocado 810,4.00,988

the radio boys craft a really rather unique experience here which gives you a good idea of why its the best album on the rym charts my dad loves this my brothers love it even my dog likes it its the best alt rock example there is thom is a bit annoying and this album is without a doubt kind of bizzare to the simple bon jovi listening plebian but its positives greatly out shine any oddities is holds with it this is the most widely likeable alternative and art rockish album you can find,4.50,489

radiohead is a shitwagon of retread good music ok computer is no exception there are plenty of albums by plenty of musicians before radiohead that accomplish and often to a better degree what radiohead seeks to accomplish the music itself is simple emotionally oversaturated but with very little real substance if radiohead existed in a subterfuge of a musicless hellscape their music would still sound contrived and insincere,1.00,426

i am not going to try to bullshit some sort of what can i say that has not been said already review or whatever i am just trying to get a review attached to every album i have rated on this site this is a very solid album from a very solid if just a touch overrated band i remember checking this out of my local library and being floored by airbags lyrics then falling in love with the album as the beeps at the end of the song fell into the delicious acoustic guitar riff of paranoid android i think this album falls flat a few times let down is kind of boring britpop fitter happier is great but kind of throwaway electioneering is an okay rock song that sounds out of place in the albums context and i wish the album ended on lucky because a it feels more like a closer than the tourist and b the tourist has some obnoxious vocals from yorke although the microwave ping that ends the album makes me laugh besides these nitpicks i think this is a great album and clearly a lot of other people do too 1 of all time though i do not think so perfect for airbag commercials,4.00,1071
maybe the best album of alltimei do not know it is an unending fight with kid a i cannot think of an album that can be more innovative and accessiblemelodic at the same time there was nothing like that in the pop landscape of the 90s at a time when people began to say that everything had already be done in music ok computer proves them wrong i do not know if it is possible considering the competition but i increasingly think that exit music is their best song best songs airbag paranoid android exit music for a film let down karma police  lucky fav lyrics in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe i may be paranoid but not an android up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home we hope that you chock pull me out of the aircrash pull me out of the lake because i am your superhero we are standing on the edge discography ranking httpsrateyourmusiccom listfredcdiscographyranking1radiohead andthomyorke,5.00,942
first they need to actually sit down and write a song then they need to make sure that it is a song and not word salad then they need to set it to music that is not hammered out using the demo tunes from a casiotone with equal input from all 8 members oh and once that is done they need to learn the piece and then they can record something of quality which is not this song also they have not done anything for two years,2.50,421
hello welcome back to episode three of the series first listen radiohead edition radiohead is a band i never had much experience with so i decided to check out the acclaimed band for myself so far i have enjoyed them with the bends being preferred over pablo honey by a lot now we reach the iconic ok computer an album many consider to be one of the greatest ever let us dive in and see where i stand so this album took a while to grow on me i will fully admit that i new right away from airbag that this would be a much more challenging and demanding listen than the post grunge and small amount of art rock on the bends however in hindsight airbag is one of my favorite songs here for sure it sets a tone of a narrator with such a unique worldview one that over the course of the album explores mainly themes of alienation that really hit home no surprises is a beautifully haunting track that truly encompasses ok computer in a microcosm yet it truly all deserves to be heard mostly paranoid android is an opus karma police is one of the greatest pop songs i have ever heard lucky is like paranoid pink floyd on meth and fitter happier is my favorite piece of musique concrete some moments do not hit for me i will be honest i do not like let down much as it feels too boring to hit same for closer the tourist yet neither song could be considered bad just not for me overall this album is just truly an experience it is great light 9,4.50,1437
however cliche this might sound ok computer is the record that got me from passively liking music to actually getting into music i was on a boy scouts mountain biking trip and i crashed down a hill on the first day hurting my arm bad enough that i had to sit out for the trails real shame i was looking forward to those luckily enough though this gave me time to check out this album going from the billboard top 40 to ok computer was hard i am under the belief that if someone consumes top 40 pop music every day for too long that it actually rewires your brain and makes it more difficult to enjoy music outside the ordinary i am well aware of how pretentious that sounds but i experienced it first hand it took me weeks on end to let this album click what is funny is now that i look back on all the albums i have gotten into this is by far one of the most accessible none of this takes away however from how mind blown i was hearing paranoid android for the first time in a tent late at night everyone has that one band that broke the dam open for their music exploration and radiohead was that band for me ok computer remains not only their most impressive album but one of the most impressive i have ever heard favorite tracks let down paranoid android airbag exit music no surprises climbing up the walls lucky karma police tourist electioneering,5.00,1353
after coming back to this once you experienced all the kinks all the pink floyds all the fausts all the buckleys all the kraftwerks all the joy divisons all the rems all the smiths all the nirvanas and all the u2s that inspired it it becomes all the less impressive and all the less important even more funny is that those artists are barely beneath surface tier most of these songs are actually just a step away from being bland coldplay pop yeah you know your history of art rock to a t but that becomes irrelevant if you cannot write just one song that is good in its entirety well to be fair they actually can  those appear in the form of electioneering let down climbing up and lucky but only four songs being fully developed out of twelve is not that much of a batting average for what is supposed to be the album sure a lot of the songs have good even brilliant ideas in them i will give it that but they all end up as blurs that really have no distinct enough progressions nor climaxes justnothing disappointing nothingness you know after relistening to the entire radiohead opus these past few days i cannot for the life of me figure out why they are so revered they were my favourite band when i was 1314 but i quickly got bored of them by 15 already is it possible that the average listeners taste never develops and they are afraid of it developing doubtful but that sure as hell would explain the rym top 100 and this being its 1 all i can say is that you should listen to your ears and not your peers at the very least ok computer is aptly named for it is just ok and it eternally meanders between the borders of okness and mediocrity not recommended best song let down,0.50,1683
to speak of ok computer is to refer to one of the most masterful works in the industry one of those specific works in which the concept of each song and the album the production the lyrics the voice and the arrangements of the instruments fit together in such a way that a fairly round product is obtained with many nuances that can be broken down and analyzed separately in a very detailed way what makes this album interesting at first is the concept the way of dealing with melancholy and anxiety from a futuristic point of view gives the album a lot of personality through elaborate and conceptual lyrics lyrics that without being complex play a lot with analogies and they do not turn out to be direct at all from the concept of the album and the lyrics of its songs derives the production and arrangements of the album both aspects turn out to be extremely ambitious due to the polished sound that is achieved throughout the songs to the elaborate electric guitar arrangements are sometimes added instruments such as the tambourine piano acoustic guitar or even a cowbell when analyzing the sound that radiohead achieved with this album and the instruments used it is impossible not to stop to consider each song separately and what it contributes to the general idea of the album airbag opens with a series of electric guitars that vary throughout the song and they capture different moments through it through a varied sound that sometimes feels even saturated all this making a fairly solid song that culminates with distorted digital arrangements that denote a certain intensity and experimentation a quite striking song from beginning to end finally paranoid android is without a doubt the greatest jewel of the album a song that can only be defined as a masterpiece due to its tremendous complexity and arrogance with a structure that varies and changes throughout it without ups and downs and with an instrumentation made up of several levels to which vocal harmonies are even incorporated to divide the last stretch of the song from the rest of it subterranean homesick alien is also interesting in it the band plays with the notes of the keyboard and various acoustic guitars making the arrangements of the song somewhat unpredictable throughout it all without neglecting the production by having background arrangements exit music for a film begins by offering something different a calmer and simpler song that begins with an acoustic guitar and steadily progresses incorporating multiple vocal harmonies and experimental sounds let down like the previous songs on the album plays a lot with the strumming of the guitar but reaffirms it by means of a quite interesting bridge to which digital sounds are incorporated in the same way this song has what is possibly the best vocal performance of thom yorke on the album by abruptly changing from low notes to higher notes after the bridge changing from the melancholy and bleak sound to a more upbeat sound the first 5 songs on the album are consolidated with karma police one of the bands most recognized songs and that manages to continue offering personality through a song that develops with piano chords and that has to close experimentally so as not to clash with the concept of the album which leads us to the next song fitter happier is a piece which must be the most conceptual of the entire album with piano arrangements spoken voices and distorted random sounds its purpose is to transmit social schemes already established and that can become a strong pressure on us the album continues with electioneering a song whose concept is essentially based on offering a type of energetic rock loaded with many guitars which at this point in the album brings freshness and offer a different point of view on the album due to its very specific sound climbing up the walls through string arrangements its effective and leading drummer coupled with eccentric arrangements throughout this constitutes what is the most experimental song on the album no surprises is one of the most solid songs on this a very good sound achieved by its production that sublimely manages to consolidate and execute ideas that have already been seen in other songs such as let down or karma police up to this point in the album you can see a huge number of ideas developed specifically in each of the songs granting a touch of diversity without losing the direction that was already finished and complementing each other it is incredible how the band managed to handle various concepts taking them to the best possible terms in terms of quality without sacrificing cohesion at any time once the first 10 songs have passed the first song comes which may seem out of tune lucky is a fairly solid and quality song due to its guitar arrangements but it becomes out of tune due to how direct it is the interesting production is still present because the guitars are incorporated with the kind of sophisticated vocal harmonies that had already been seen in songs like exit musicfor a film as well as a distorted background sound that manages to add some personality to the song in general a song that it is quite solid but the thread that was being presented in the past songs is lost a bit by having a style more typical of alternative rock that was seen a lot in the 90s the album ends with the tourist a song that in fact collects the ideas of the previous song offering electric guitars with a slower tempo and executed in a very good way incorporating in the same way the vocal harmonies seen in lucky and offering a guitar solo that is repeated at the end of the song a piece that resembles lucky in concept but manages to separate itself due to its approximation which is clearly reflected in the slow and calm progress of the song ok computers list of songs represents a fairly complete journey in which different nuances are analyzed and elaborated in depth without neglecting the quality of each element of these through a fairly effective order they take you by the hand exploring the ideas of thom yorke on alienation and the future multiple guitars voices keyboards experimentation string arrangements and others enter the albums formula to offer surprising approximations of a quite complex but at the same time clear and concise vision developed by the band to the depths of the concept in general and constantly reinventing themselves throughout the album they start fast with sophisticated songs loaded with elements they continue with the same idea offering something different depending on the melody or the instruments used all this to finish and land their entire vision by diluting it a bit and capturing it in a alternative rock without so many pretensions but equally solid that offers a more direct approach but that shows how effective they are with the guitars while seasoning both songs with experimental arrangements ok computer represents one of the greatest triumphs in the history of music one of those albums that encapsulate an entire concept and almost perfectly execute a series of ideas so vast that it is hard to believe the way they are embodied an ambitious vision a superb execution of each one of the members and a production so good and complex are the main elements of an album that without a doubt is among the greatest in history,5.00,7314
this album is a really special piece of music for me considering how relevant it is to my upbringing i have been digging away at it for wellover half a decade and grew up to bits and pieces of it since i was a kid via my dad and my cousins there is not a whole lot of wellwritten music about what it is like living in a digitally consumed somewhat okay pretty much fullon dystopic hyperindustrial world you can get a lot of edgy dance music that tries really hard to sound robotic but this is really an album that touches upon how cold and inhuman technological development digitally or otherwise has turned society at large the music is of course brilliant and wellcrafted innovative as hell too but the real sell for me is how this is the first highly acclaimed epic societal critique album that actually talks about stuff i have lived through and have been scared numbed fascinated stunned and puzzled by as my awareness of how cold technology has turned a lot of us this album just grows on me even more one of the rare albums that lives up to the hype,4.50,1056
in 1997 popular music and alt rock took a huge turn with the technology themed and hugely innovative ok computer there is not much to be said about this album that has not been said before this is without a doubt the start of the 2000s alternative music burst with a track list that is nearly a greatest hits album ok computer is an iconic record that not many albums to this day compare the record starts with the fantastic guitar riff and jingle bells of airbag a song that deals with thom reflecting on his near death in a car accident that was thankfully stopped by the cars airbag the music on this is some of the most well composed with a very futuristic sound and overlapping guitar layers the solo from johnny greenwood in the second half is melodic layered and has a creepy yet powerful feel to it all of that is great but the ending to this song is unbelievable it starts to break down and decompose a bit with the glitch call and response from the guitars and bass which is then followed up by thom yorkes dry descending melody that gets echoed and layered by a great string synth the real genius of this ending is the call back to the opening riff and how it interplays and dances with thoms melody a truly remarkable opener that is followed up with the highly praised almost prog like paranoid android this song rocks the house and has 3 different but equally kick ass parts and a reprise at the end my favorite part there is not much to say about this song and although it is not really one of my most favorites off of this album i can almost get the huge appeal and why this is still one of the bands most famous songs next to creep the rest of the track list has great contrasts with the beautiful relaxed subterranean homesick alien into the epic and chilling exist music for a film used brilliantly in the episode shut up and dance from the netflix original program black mirror after that we get the melodic and dissociative let down one of the more poppy songs on the record but do not let that distract you from the poetic lyrics and amazing climax of this track then we get karma police a piece i feel deserves all the acclaim it receives and is the bands objective best song with some of their best lyrics we get a perfectly accessible yet powerful moving innovative and catchy as fuck track that has one of the best outrorefrains i have heard in popular music the second half of this album i feel is not as iconic but takes a more cohesive and story like approach to the topics of the record starting off with fitter happier an interlude that tends to get misunderstood this piece sets the mood perfectly and is criminally underrated the closer to this album the tourist is nice and slow with an explosive chorus that makes sure this masterpiece ends on the best note it can it ends the record off with a little ding which almost leaves this depressive concept with a bit of optimism and has a number of different meanings the one issue with this record is the song electioneering this is a great song and is fun to an extent but lyrically and sonically it just barely fits on this album with the release of oknotok where we got some b sides and other songs recorded in the ok computer sessions a lot of those songs could have fit way better on the album instead of electioneering like seriously if this album had something like lift instead of electioneering it would be perfect favorite songs airbag exit music for a film karma police fitter happier climbing up the walls no surprises least favorite song electioneering 9810,4.50,3550
i am writing these lines on 01112020 after many auditions going through all four stages of denial going from hate to love i confess yes this is really a worthy candidate for the role of the greatest rock album in history an album made by a group of extremely talented songwriters and above all musicians which amalgamates the best of all the rock music of the 20th century that came before it  from the dark side of the moon neu and in the court of the crimson king to laughing stock daydream nation and a storm in heaven an album where every song every beat every line is right on target the album with ingenious in its simplicity and intelligibility lyrics about human relations politics world order and space quite minimalistic but at the same time capable of evoking a full palette of emotions from laughter to tears my minireview turned out to be utterly pretentious and i ask you to forgive me for this i myself do not like all these pathetic panegyrics with unnatural praise of performers and albums from exalted soyboys because it is impossible to sincerely express feelings through writing they can only be felt but it just seems to me that after ok computer all the rest of rock music is unnecessary,5.00,1209
ok computer for me it is not a great album by the band as many on the site put it but just another good alternative rock album the bends if so deserves to be highlighted here no surprises is the song that most captivated me to hear again,4.00,237
so while music is entirely subjective and should defer all logic somehow stupid selfproclaimed music critics seem to take to reviewing this record in an entirely logical sense how stupid is that at the end of the day art is about wow that major seventh chord is really complementary to that diminish fourth hell no it is about emotion and this album through all its memage made me feel more emotions than most albums are capable of of radiohead have a serious soft spot for me and that is because i have listened to all of their records hundreds of times now my favorite tracks on this album really get to me airbag being one the greatest openers in an album ever with that cello like distorted guitar and those incredibly recyclable lyrics in the next world war i am born again at the end of the day this album really is not as glorious as it sounds it features songs about someone surviving a car crash someone who is sick of his home town the recipe to be happy in the modern world and seemingly mundane shit but the juxtaposition of these gloriously distorted vibrant and hypnotic guitars keys and percussion instruments is entirely why this album gets so much cred on top of that listen to this album right when get up watch the sunrise and tell me this album is not a masterpiece a perfect album by most individuals standards the only reason why music critics knock it is because it is overrated but music cannot be overrated because it is subjective how can you personally overrate something you base how you like an album on how it effects you not on how good the compositions are or the musicality that is just looking past art as a medium entirely it defeats the purpose of creating music and listening to it so grow a pair listen to this album all day long and gain some appreciation for the album that thom yorke dreads to tour the album plays on the mundanity of western life in the modern day he predicts it depicts a dramatization of the issues the 21stcentury would ultimately be placed with global warming i will take handshake of carbon monoxide isolation wanting more meaning in the pursuit of existing i tell i will my friends but they will never believe me they think that i have finally lost it completely,5.00,2227
it is odd from us perspective to understand the draw of this album the avalanches of praise heaped on it is productionasaninstrument approach and accolades for eclipsing every musical expression since the dawn of mankind with its orchestral spaceprog collage pretty remarkable considering they do not even play it on classic rock radio the bands true strength is yorkes voice and the cuts that push this remarkable mechanism to center stage dominate the proceedings the minimalist naked guitar of exit music for a film focuses the listener on his achingly elegant vocal gloom as the din of organs drums and other sounds swell and vanish in the background karma police also takes full advantage of yorkes soaring despair as simple piano lines swell to a grand clamor in a style reminiscent of bowies space oddity the full sound of the band is best realized in the wounded shuffling din of climbing up the walls bombastic orchestral racket ebbing and flowing as the song trudges to conclusion it is not all great the basslines and some of yorkes vocal tendencies cannot seem to shake the ghost of a bad u2 imitation lucky has the potential to be the most harrowing guitardriven rock songs in decades like a britpop take on no quarter if it were not for a crappy chorus that drops all tension and backbuilt momentum like a broken elevator it is an interesting record sonically ambitious for the time period with great vocals and several strong songs but despite what you have heard it will not cure your cancer,3.00,1507
let down being my least favorite track on here by a long shot probably says more than any review i could write could lucky and the tourist were unremarkable upon my first few listens but they are growing on me now even though they do not really conclude the album very well in my opinion yeah i love fitter happier electioneering and climbing up the walls they are all fantastic tracks fight me but yeah honestly looking at all the reviews and comments on this album and in fact all radioheads stuff makes me realize that no one agrees on anything when it comes to radiohead it is shocking they are by far the most divisive band on this site the naysayers call them overrated drivel with very little value and the obsessives call them the best thing since jesus christ and let us be fair neither of these perspectives are correct radiohead is one of the most important bands of the 90s and 00s no matter your feelings on them their progression to straightup experimentation from album to album is by far one of the greatest shifts in all of popular music history comparable to the beatles and like the beatles they are consistently able to top the charts even if filled with hip hop and pop acts with every album most advanced artistic music wishes it could be on the billboard period radiohead live the fantasy of being quite possibly the biggest rock band releasing music anymore on the other side of the plate radiohead often feels like they try too hard sometimes everything they write is very serious and artsy and on most first listens to their albums they barely click at all their progressive embracing is rightfully considered alienating and in some circles pretentious i do not use that word to describe things anymore but that is a different story critics would gush over a mixtape of their farts thom yorke sometimes comes off as an outspoken roger waters figure and a freak for the electronic abandoning many rock conventions and allowing for the dissolution of rock in the mainstream as a result but man to give this album a bad score requires some type of person i would think even from a more technical view the production here is spot on the electronic elements blending seamlessly with the real life band elements coalescing into a full soundscape that can sound delicate pretty and frail or overpowering huge and noisy what is oddly prophetic to me is how perfect a transition this serves between the bends and kid a the bends is this overly emotional wild child of an album with a lot of youth to say and plenty of time to say it kid a is a frozen block or transhumanism where all that remains of that emotion is phony emulation whereas the bends is genuine kid a is the uncanny valley and this album serves as the bridge between them there is an insecurity here that is palpable in the anxiety certain tracks here emanate i could best compare it to a human being transformed into a machine and fighting back in vain and it is chilling in its acceptance of this fate by the end in some way very good album by a very good band,4.50,3045
radioheads success was bleaking them out the isolation was pushing their naked skin against a cold metal until they were hopelessly scared and then they shattered outwards this was a natural defense mechanism an abstract progression which had begun to lose grip on the guitar work the strings visibly evaporating into an atmospheric fog controlled by machines plotting their conquest during this crisis ok computer stabbed up through the ground and the people fell to their knees instantaneously worshipping it as a historical landmark frozen in the most important league of all albums ever made we were no longer dealing with an ordinary band anymore that much was certain make no miscalculations without this record radiohead would not be a conversation this is still the album which all of their other albums lean upon sprouting outwards in one way or another with their own dedicated followers but everyoneart students simpleton radio listeners critical publications award ceremonies mtv execs library of congresseveryone agreed that this was a significant contribution to the very fiber of music itself and yet for me it felt like the aura of devotion had outgrown the nervous system while the devotees themselves were so delirious by its fumes that you could not engage in a sober dialogue about their fucking holy artifact please you must believe me i get it it is ok computer it is an insult to even call this an album but when i listen to it i hear the restless sound of a distracted band headed somewhere else this is a mere stopover where radiohead filled up with gas checked the map and then continued on their quest towards the boundaries of themselves which as we all know was a territory they discovered shortly afterward,5.00,1736
ok computer is the kind of thing that so many clamour to have written about that there is no unsaid thing about it it is a really cool inventive rock album that eschews the britpop excesses of oasis it avoids big radio hits and is the poster boy for alternative rock at one point this really did stick out like a sore thumb moody and selfreflective electronictinged art rock for people that wanted a rock album but not a rock album radiohead found their niche with this one and frankly changed the landscape of rock music to come there really is a before and after ok computer arguably every evenslightly experimental rock album since ok computer can draw a thick line back to this primordial ooze of an album,4.00,709
nothing can be said that has not been said before on this album the only thing i could add are the errors that i feel it has and although they are quite slight they are still errors after all ok computer is a concept album to say that it is not to throw everything done by him all the legacy he harvested down the drain since after all this legacy is based on what the album handles as a concept postmodern malaise monotony desolation consumerism that is modern life now this work when handling and giving expression to a concept cannot have conceptual gaps it must not break with the thread it creates the first conceptual mistake that occurs is starting the album if we compare airbag with other songs within the album we will see that this one breaks with the scheme do not get me wrong i love airbag i think it is one of radioheads best songs however as a concept i think it is not on the album yes i know perfectly well that it is the portrait of thoms phobia of cars but it lacks substance to leave you with the desolation of a modern time it happens to be more than a personal anecdote of yorke as a parenthesis that it is an ironic look about technology and how it can kill you and save you at the same time it seems to me an absurd overconceptualization by the public nothing more pretentious the second error is followed paranoid android yes even if it hurts this is the biggest mistake in the album it completely breaks with the thread lyrically it seems bad to me and musically it does not seem like the jewel that many paint that thing about there are three songs in one or that it is a complex work that portrays multiple mental states seems like pure bravado to me the song is nothing more than a mix between the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and thoms bad experience in a bar but without knowing what to get at the lyrics are too ambiguous it does not convey anything at all to me and the one sentence that stood out to me with your opinions which are of no consequence at all was totally debunked by thom who says that it was just a joke you have to interpret this in reverse in fact sometimes it is my opinion that does not matter which would be the only sensible thing in the whole song really in terms of musicality i do not think it is bad at all but not at all the jewel that many acclaim i feel it too monotonous despite its section changes since these are about the same thing i do not feel a difference beyond the tempo i also do not feel a good climax that makes up for almost seven minutes the only climax that counts is a guitar solo like a boring 90s rockand also harassing what paranoid android does do well is the interlude between it and airbag and the music video that manages to express everything the song cannot the last error in ok computer does not really seem like an error to me exit music for a film may have a mellow lyric which collides with the theme but i think this lends itself to multiple interpretations and i do not think closed as before in addition musically it is a gem a lesson on how to make a good outro that resolves all the tension accumulated during the first 250 minutes another parenthesis electioneering is not at all out of tune with the album the lyrics are political enough not to be part of okc i do not know why most discredit this one if the second song is an electioneering but over 6 minutes haha the rest he solves it well but if i have to emphasize something it is a song that is not talked about much and is very relegated climbing up the walls this and fitter happier are the epitome of the work they are the cuts that give it consistency and allow it to be the masterpiece that it is for many climbing up the walls is lyrically deep and complex it portrays the dementia produced by an escape from impulses or inner demons and as if that were not enough the instrumentation is spectacular a chaotic environment full of station samples a distorted voice and a string arrangement that stalks the authors dementia until it ends in an anguished cry that represents the loss before those demons his total dementia disturbing and deep only someone obtuse would consider paranoid android above it,4.00,4165
a type of music that i pay a lot of attention to are those that deal with how gray and cold our lives are the alienation of our existence the empty reality that we carry give it whatever title you want all this theme makes me imagine an aesthetic formed by many albums that have passed through my ears together with a complete and indirect collaboration with the flow of the internet i am referring to all those emotions and sensations that we perceive when moving from nyc hell 300am to the replica or from space is only noise to  atarash hi no tanj yes i am talking about that feeling of strange rain in the early morning heard inside an empty apartment located in the center of the city or of that terrifying emptiness that sometimes occurs in me when i find myself immersed in this vast digital space that we call the internet i think it is some pretty fucking shit just thinking about social media carefully makes my head hurt it is a shitty concept i do not know how they came up with it but despite everything i can say about them i am still there along with everyone else we spend every day of our lives dedicating time to it we spend hours and hours shaping our image like creating a damn sim i find it interesting that radiohead and ok computer in particular are like the universal band and album of our generation that is to say they made very good music and everything but it also has its merit that in 1997 they predicted how life was going to be in the late capitalism of the 21st century yes it is obvious that perhaps other authors talked about it many years before of this release but not in the manner nor on a scale as popular as ok computer did what i want to say is that it is interesting that an album with such a powerful theme of alienation is one of the most appreciated by the generation that has experienced the longest time on the internet it is the direct target i guess we value the works that tell us in detail our solitary experiences on the other hand there is something i cannot stop thinking about the truth is that i do not find it so cool to have prophesied about the future back in 1997 i feel like it hides a deep desolation i mean yes it is true they influenced a lot of bands and artists but have you guys felt that feeling when you say mmh this is going to be horrible and it ends up being horrible it is a hahaha i guessed it for the next 5 minutes but after depression it is 349 am and i honestly feel bad for thom yorke the soul of him must be that empty apartment located in the center of the city i wonder if he works out 3 times a week,4.50,2583
this album could have been the best thing of all time the first 6 tracks and no surprises should have been released by itself these 8 tracks would have stood perfectly on its own without the rest of the album bogging itself down it would have been perfect this non existent album would be rocks magnum opus take out tracks 7 8 9 11 and 12 and you have got yourself a 10,4.00,369
update 1609 to credit ok computer as the best album of the 90s and perhaps of all time is somewhat if a far reaching statement i think if anything ok computer was the best album at its right time along with many other classics yes it is a classic both in terms of significance and musical progress and it did set the bar really high in rock but with the bends radiohead had already set that bar high it is just that not as many people were watching you have to remember that ok computer was introduced by romeo  juliet so when paranoid android came out all ears were listening including america there is no doubt this was a fantastic album and was the pop album that everyone had been waiting for for a long time since maybe u2s joshua tree why apart from hip hop and post grunge bullshit oasis having majorly proved to the world they were a flunk the spot was there to be taken and radiohead seized the opportunity with balls and belief probably not expecting the reaction the album has managed to generate up until now u2 had been the biggest band in the world but with ok computer it was all over there was a new sheriff in town and the truth is that when i first heard paranoid android i realise how much more there was then just pop beauty these guys were abstract deep conceptual and thematic so not only did the music sound great it was also saying something which fit perfectly in the fear and uncertainty of the computer age in short radiohead were taking their ideas far beyond their melodies in the bend into a modern rock vision and it paid off because the whole world was waiting for it musically ok computer is arguably even better than kid a the band push themselves introduce instrumental art prog and incorporate it with electronic influences it is a real leap of faith sometimes though it just falls short such as in the meandering let down or the nine inch nails influenced climbing up the walls but if ok computer dies have its moments in its peaks it will leave you speechless paranoid android is the modern day pink floyd bohemian rhapsody exit music is the perfectly crafted ballad fitter happier is post modern poetry and lucky gives wish you were here a decent run for its money elsewhere the album dies fall in the somewhat commercial side but still excellent singles no surprises and karma police karma police is the beatles beauty all over but not done by a try hard band like oasis in fact it is a little bit too close to sexy sadie but that is ok because it is an instant hit so yeah ok computer the album that everyone raves about the number one album of the 90s and of all time fir some critics the album was just at the right place at the right time radiohead striked when the iron was hot and they did it with a real focused plan from there on in they had grabbed the musical industry by the halls and the world was their command they could literally drop shit and the world was buying itbecause they had the guts of saying something to the world that not many bands could or had been able to at that point every rockindie wanted to be radiohead sound like radiohead and follow their footsteps coldplay muse travis hell even placebo no one would be able to knock them off the podium they owned rock line no other band they turned it into their sound period  in hindsight it does sound like it was in its time and i have discovered many other bands around at the same time that were also doing daring things so i cannot say it is the best album if the 90s it is a very good album but i think in terms of the actual songs and their beauty the bends is all of it and ok computer loses some if that beauty because if the bass appeal and commercialism around it let us face it karma police is not anything new if you have heard sexy sadie climbing up the walls is very achtung baby reminiscent and let down is nothing spectacular in my opinion but that is not what i love about ok computer it is the atmosphere and message when tom yorke sings about bring back to save the universe from music and trite he is spot on when he screams out uptight in subterrenean homesick blues it really does sound like he is calling out the neurosis of the world and when he sings exit music it is really an apocalyptic ballad but that is not the most touching part of the album who would have thought a poem on existentialism narrated by a computerised vocoder would have come accross as so real so frightening and so powerful as on fitter happier which is actually just an interlude it is that which ok computer will be always remembered for the reality of the 20th century malaise that had never ever been so apparent as the decade was ending and the cold cruel and emotionless computer age was slowly creeping in call it a premonition a vision a prophecy but ok computer may just be the most relevant album ever made the the world needed this,4.50,4858
ok computer is an expansive and cinematic record albums of this ilk are often described as ambitious as if to insinuate that they aim high but do not quite succeed ok computer is an ambitious album which completely nails what it is trying to do it has also defined how postproduction is approached by most modern rock bands radiohead manages to be epic in a sophisticated way bands who perform epic music like muse or kings of leon sometimes sound a little pretentious as if the audience know that the style they are performing in places more importance on the music than it actually deserves ok computer presents itself as epic and important in a completely unpretentious way it has been said a million times but this album really shows off the full breadth of how compelling and detailed a catchy rock record can be,5.00,817
i guess i will never understand the phenomena behind this album being ryms 1 it is the first time for me to listen to radiohead and well there is nothing original about it no inventiveness whatsoever none of the tracks suit me at least a bit it is lacking so many things to be a good album  from lack of energy to weird chaotic music writing where is the thing people see or hear in this record beauty anything memorable vocals are average music isat least average someone said that it at least is not annoying and i get behind that i feel that that is the first that much overrated album i had chance to listen to and i hope it will remain the last one,1.50,653
echoes of the bunnymen and the cure permeates throughout and penetrate just enough of the albums brooding aesthetics to add life to such a nihilistic experience the definitive heir to dsotm period,5.00,196
i would like to give more of this album but that would not be in line with my beliefs about the bestrated music production at rym after getting through it the second time i still have the same observations as the first time first of all there is no linear continuity with the entire album the songs are climatically scattered and too short to enjoy the leading melancholy only the last three songs manage to do this but this is still not the height of musicality a slight disappointment 65  10,3.00,493
when monster have bad day mostly because cookie stocks go down and me no get free promotional cookies in mail me loves me some good space art rock that make monster feel detached like politicians brain one of me favorite albums is ok computer by radiohead this album appear very popular and make people and monster happy alike music chilled out like glass of cookie juice in refrigerator with layer of space effects like frosting flowing on topographic pastures on cookie me love ok computer but me prefer to fantasize that title actually ok cookie because that make monster even more happy me no get free cookie this week but me have secret stash and all this talk bout cookie make monster anxious so me eat cookie now nom nom nom,4.00,731
it is enjoyable to say the least but yorkes strange voice and piss poor lyrics ruin it for me,2.50,93
what can i say the most overrated album in history of rock music my ears are still bleeding from it this is better album than zeppelin iv or dark side of the moon or revolver from the beatles etcetcetc in what universe,0.50,218
i will never forget the first time i listened to this album because i hated it nonetheless this album truly defined my own personal transition from a passive music listener to an active one allow me to elaborate almost immediately after my first disappointing run through this album i forced myself to listen to it again and then again my cousin had been preaching this band to me for years how could he possibly be wrong well he was not it took me several listens for me to start really hearing the nuances of this album by my 10th listen i was in love indeed this album sharpened my ears to the wonderful world of nuanced  thoughtful music none of the following bands would i appreciate if it was not for this learning experience arcade fire godspeed you black emperor the velvet underground the national neutral milk hotel sigur ros,4.50,835
i bought into the rating and decided to listen to this creation tried to swallow several times and to no avail sadness terribly annoying vocals if it can be called vocals at all i will not say anything about the instrumental part at all it is not there although i agree a couple of interesting moments slipped through and it will hardly pull a c grade i understand why the rating of this group is too high it is mostly listened to by people who are far from the creations of led zeppelin or king crimson and cannot adequately evaluate it but how can i put it on a par with the above groups moreover evaluate them even higher my brain refuses to understand maybe among the gray mass of pop music this looks like a masterpiece but thank god i do not force myself with pop music and i will not torture myself with this creation either,3.00,831
ok  computer how should i write this review thom yorke sounds like a psychopath in some of these songs some of them were decent the more quiet ones avoid the shortest track fitter happier it is definitely an album filler i am surprised but not surprised on how popular this album is i do not considered the band of radiohead to have much talent let us just say that most of the time when yorke sings i think it sounds awful for this review i actually looked up the lyrics and they were awful too they were obviously spouting liberal propaganda in a more subtle way i go forward while you go backward and we meet somehow the last three tracks of this lp is stronger than the first nine except for the exception of let down which is probably the best song on this whole thing also i can definitely see where blur got their influence on their 13 album released two years later,3.00,873
back when a time when online music streaming was at best in its infancy i use to grab all my brothers cds i could from his music collection next to my room i heard a lot of hype about this band and particularly this album ok computer i believe a few months later currently in my early 20s i went on a family holiday in 0708 up north in the uk and stopped at a premier inn  a half way house for all you not from britain and finally push play on my ipod to digested what i could of this album i remember being not entirely won over at first until the drums on subterranean homesick alien i remember me thinking what the hell is this and than my love affair of radiohead started to grow as the years went by songs like karma police paranoid android and no surprises become ipod shuffle favourites of mine which would leave me to other albums and songs of radiohead i would admire just as much the meaning to this story is that i remember where i was and how my admiration grew for such a universally and critically acclaimed band such as these guys i will always have a place in my heart those memories i will always cherish for me till the end of time much hearts  ,5.00,1163
in the face of a handed down classic album even if the content he reissued as a bonus may be a recording of casual singing when he was on the tuba he still must obediently accept it this is called a classic  ,5.00,208
i have finally listened to this album with full attention one of those things i wanted to do for a long time i felt like i would like this album and i do  it is nicely emotional but and i should have suspected that just as well it is also veeeeeeeeery repetitive pair these two things and you get an album that what is that word hmm ah yes bores me so only 2 from me done with this,0.50,381
i promise and lift are such classic radiohead songs that they make you wonder what could have been it is good the band moved on but i am so nostalgic for that bends sound so it is nice to hear new old songs in that style that are actually fantastic the rest of the tracks here including other new addition man of war are more moody experimental cuts with a few exceptions polyethylene parts 1  2 pearly and palo alto are all great rock songs that sound more straightforward and vicious than radiohead were on any longplayer i am glad they released these tracks from the vault and gathered all the material here it is very bittersweet to listen to like finding old letters from a dead friend you know nothing can rewind the clock to make this alive again but it is good we get this glimpse at all,4.00,795
this album will always hold a special place in my heart as it is the first indiehipster album i heard and i think it is the pinnacle of entrylevel music the base sound of colorful 90s alternative rock is accessible enough for normies to leave it on but unique enough for them to go hm interesting the production and arrangements are impeccable enough to leave those normies impressed in a visceral way the songs are varied enough so those normies do not get bored and the structures are interesting and complex enough that those normies will get more out of the album the more they pay attention and even after all of these years the little normie inside me still eats up this fauxavantgarde bullshit part of i journey through ryms top 100 albums abandoned,4.50,756
there is not much i can add that stands out from the firehydrant of praise this album has received however what i have always wanted to say about it is how one journalist remarked ok computer is not an easy listen were they referring to its ironic blissful instrumentation juxtaposed to depressing lyrics in no surprises or the uneasy but dour drag of fitter happier i have listened to this album so many times that both songs are neither depressing nor dour there is so much about ok computer that summarizes life even 20 years after its initial release without even using words it does not feel dour to me it feels wonderfully fitting in our current world but manages to make me feel hopeful it is a statement a perfect one it is a quote in brass letters hammered to the wall in the cold museum on gloomy winters morning all lit up in its shiny glory for patrons to read but nobody cares they read the quote and forget about it some read the quote and cherish and relish in it worship it pray to it every waking day some look at it and scoff disregard it think it is hogwash the reality is most people do not give a shit still the shiny brass quote of ok computer by the rock band radiohead hangs on the marble wall in the museum recognized by many disregarded by few but will go unnoticed to most people rated as the top of rymcom it is the best album ever made its praise is like kanye west talking to himself walking in a hallway of mirrors however there are the few aforementioned ones who pray to the shiny brass quote and relish in it there is something to be said about finding something that you find special it attaches you and never goes away i admit that i am one of these individuals despite only listening to it every once in awhile  moving on from it most people i have connected with in my life have never heard of it my selfproclaimed favorite album has been shared to some of my closest friends but unfortunately for me none of them care as much for it as i do i want to share it and wish people would love it as much as i do but perhaps it is simply not for most people the ones in the museum who walk on by not caring about the shiny quote on the wall that is okay i know there are plenty of others who share the love for it,5.00,2245
perhaps my third attempt to jam this album into my psyche happens to coincide with having seen the group live at glastonbury 17 the performance which consisted of all of this album was considered a bit of a drag and i remember thinking yes finally we are on the same page radiohead are a bit of a whiny drag however  returning to the record afterward the whole encounter has actually managed to chip away some of the mystique for me and i am now comfortable acknowledging the good bits the hits the nicely jagged electioneering and ignoring the bad bits all the whining dragness that shitty robot track i am not going to own it and listen to it regularly but i have come some way to seeing it in a stable context rather than through my own prejudices,3.00,750
ok computer is considered one of the best and most influential albums of the 90s and in music history the truth is that it is excellent and even managed to surpass the remarkable the bends it was groundbreaking for its electronically influenced sound and allusions to technology and alienation from the modern world the title speaks volumes it has great singles like paranoid android karma police no surprises curious video with thom with his head in a fish tank that fills with water and lucky previously appeared on a benefit album for warchild other beauties are let down and the grand finale the tourist how well he sings the only black point is an experiment of less than two minutes that i do not like at all a bridge work between the poprock of its beginnings and the more electronic era that would begin with kid a this 20th anniversary reissue adds a second cd called notok with eight bsides notably a reminder and polyethylene and three unreleased ones that show radioheads inspiration at the time and whose names are i promise man of war and lift already i had heard it live the first two had a video clip as a critical aspect it does not have a booklet with the lyrics as the original from 97 did which i gave away notable tracks let down lucky karma police polyethylene parts 1  2,4.50,1293
an undeniably brilliant album that deserves all the praise it gets ok computer is an anxious reflection of the upcoming digital age that has remained relevant to this day there is something new to discover every listen due to all the layers and clever arrangements on this project,4.50,280
these days i flipflop with my feelings about this album but like everybody you will ever see on this site it does mean plenty to me and my memory the feeling of paranoia is pretty spoton in a lot of areas the ending of karma police and its gradual sense of a darkness creeping up on you the whole of climbing up the walls and in others it is quite arsey fitter happier is not one of the best demonstrations of it here i feel but you got to contextualise it all for sure this would have felt powerful as fuck back then  the narrator notices how oppressive and draining capitalism is that there is no choice but to commit to it in order to survive and that no people with authority are truly willing to sympathise and help because authority comes with abuseable power and complacency with the way that things are these observations are ones that every person goes through especially at the age that most get into radiohead anyways coinciding with a time when most crave a new emotional and conceptual pulse in alternative music hence its consistent connection to every generation of kids who see radiohead as the people at the forefront of boundarypushing music you can argue all day about the details of that but the fact is that folks like i still swoon at the thought of the chorus of lucky and that the tenderness of no surprises in light of its suffocating seriously sad and suicidal subject matter hits a unique emotional place i am less interested in the specificity of the whole navigating the digital world concept and instead i appreciate the instances that thom yorke applies these feelings of paranoia to  the fear of the cars airbag failing to save him from a crash airbag the skincrawling sense that somebody is eyes are watching you climbing up the walls imposter syndrome subt homesick alien and yet still there are brief moments of euphoria like epiphanies where it all falls into place the times when the album is fully submerged in stagnant pessimism are when it feels shallow not solely because of the pessimism but because there is no light to contrast the dark and those moments of contradiction create radioheads smartest songs honestly i am not sure i listen to ok computer very often anymore but the creative decisions on it are fairly outthere so it is quite a neat album for so many people to have as a starting point into alternative music,3.50,2365
i have to admit okc is a very good album but very overrated by critics and rym userswho are heavily influenced by critics this album is so far from alltime best album albums as moving pictures led zeppelin ii quadrophenia sabbath bloody sabbath close to the edge and deep purple in rock can shit all over okc but those albums are rated generally much lower here,4.00,361
what to say about an album that has already had so much written about it the occasion of this boxset release was certainly a surprise such nostalgic lookingback was not something i ever expected from a band that is notoriously anal about what they do and do not release that being said i am not complaining this boxset is a thing of beauty previous special editions have often irritated me much of radioheads catalogue that i own sits apart from the rest of my collection simply for its awkwardness  newspaper albums discboxes newspaper albums 10 reissues that always felt like the object got in the way of the listening experience rather than complimenting it novelty for its own sake however here for the first time it feels truly justified ok computer was the first radiohead album that i heard and fell in love with i have very fond memories of sitting in the backseat of my parents car and begging them to play it luckily for me they enjoyed it too then digging into the albums impressive bsides made me fall in love with the band itself  not just it is recorded output but its ethos and its consistency the very idea of the band itself what band has bsides like this my first nascent attempt to start a band of my own in my teens began with a collective listening session during which we all shared our favourite songs i played polyethylene this is a bside was the incredulous response lull and how i made my millions likewise remain for me two of the bands most serene tracks the demo quality of how i made my millions in particular still knocks me off my feet  the sound of yorkes late wife rachel unpacking shopping in the background now all the more affective for me the best thing about this release is the white cassette the album and its bsides are amazing i knew that already and having them collected together in one package is a lovely thing but now with this mysterious cassette i find myself rediscovering this band all over again the three bonus tracks  i promise man of war and lift  are a nice touch but rightly left of the album and its singles the live versions that have been circulating for over a decade remain unmatched however the experience of listening to the white cassette recaptures the astonishment of my first listen to how i made my millions the experiments and demos collected here are of an astounding quality recognising motifs later recycled on later material is so moving to me as a longtime fan piano motifs later heard on pulkpull revolving doors are wonderful to hear  and surprising considering this beautiful instrumental piece would become one of the bands most jarring and difficult listens the demos of unknown songs are as strong as any other bside from the period the pendereckiesque violin piece that could be or perhaps is a version of a track from there will be blood a version of climbing up the walls that at first felt to me like something from 20 jazz funk greats this whole cassette is less a fragmentary audiodiary of the ok computer sessions and more of a sign of what was to come kid a and amnesiac feel less like the massive stylistic shift they are made out to be now this boxset has rekindled my love not only of ok computer but those albums and their bsides as well there is little else to say right now i am writing this as i listen to the remastered album and the cassette for the first time what strikes me is that this album feels new again i feel 13 again there will be others out there who are far more rigorous with their detective work identifying every fragment  i look forward to an imagined httpcitizeninsaneeu analysis of these sounds and notebooks  but speaking for myself i am ready to pour over this album all over again it is rare that a remastered anniversary release rekindles that kind of fire the radioheads of 1997 and 2017 have truly outdone themselves  quite literally,5.00,3857
the monotonous horror of the 21stcentury world turned into sound if only the thematicallyatmospherically unfitting electioneering were not on here it would be a masterpiece  airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police fitter happier climbing up the walls no surprises lucky the tourist  electioneering,4.50,353
what were you doing 20 years ago when this album came out  yes the release of radiohead is now comparable to 911 or the fall of the berlin wall how should i know  come on admit it  okay okay so i was standing in the saturn on the theresienhhe and this cover of the new releases jumped out at me and i bought different class from pulp there anyway when then in 1998 this is hardcore by i was really excited when pulp came out but when i was back in saturn at theresienhhe it still said ok computer and in the meantime i had of course only heard good things about it and in a mood of spontaneity i took it then radiohead went home and not pulp and i have never ever regretted it  well it works and where were you when the wall fell  i really have absolutely no idea probably in saturn at theresienhhe who knows,5.00,808
from start to finish this album pulls you into this world of 90s era paranoia about technology and politics that is still relevant today the album starts with airbag which feels like you are crashing into the world that this album creates fitting for the subject matter of that song each of the songs hold up to todays standards and there is not a dull moment even the fitter happier interlude with the stephen hawking computer voice commanding you to be a productive worker drone of society my favorite track on the album is climbing up the walls with its slow and chilling atmosphere that slowly rises capturing the feeling of paranoia and anxiety probably one of the most unsettling radiohead songs ever overall this is an amazing album probably my favorite album of all time 55,5.00,781
not bad by any means but in an alternative universe where any of these tracks would have ended up on the original release ok computer could have become a worse album and maybe not as appreciated as it is today most of these tracks just sound generic compared to any ok computer song not that they are bad just your usual 90s alt rock stuff which could be seen as a bad thing in itself still would probably recommend it if you love ok computer and if you like your 90s radiohead with thoms voice at its stongest and johnnys guitar at its showiest even though some of these cuts end up feeling way more like ambient music than they should,3.50,636
as much as it sucks to love the band in a sea of pretentious fans i cannot lie when i talk about this albums importance in getting me to listen to more art rock and electronic albums the only kind of meh song on here is electioneering which is still pretty great its this high on the charts for a reason favourite song exit music for a film,4.00,340
radiohead fans are known snobs they do not know anything about music because the only music they listen to is radiohead that is just one of many reasons why i feel distant from anything the band tries to conceive pseudo fervency and spuriousness never seemed to help one this succeeds on a grizzlying scale of greed and gluttony as if ok computer is about to devour the whole world after twenty years later not ok,1.50,413
the production and songwriting on this album are excellent my only issue is it loses steam on the last 2 tracks and fitter happier is an obvious skipper let down and electro engineering are simply good but that is not an issue the rest of the album is among what i consider the best music produced in the nineties with unlimited replay value this is truly a unique experimental work that still manages to be accessible enough so that almost everyone can enjoy 9310,4.50,464
an incredible record timeless in its production even if you do not like it you have to admit its monumental influence on the rest of music after its creation,5.00,157
although many on this site talk about this album to a more personal level by the affection of it well fuck i also decide to put it that way first of all this goes to a completely personal view in the reasoning of why i love this album and why it is my favorite ever which what i will elaborate more on is my affection in it this album gave some supposedly radical changes to my emotional and even auditory sense in music although i had known for a long time that there will be that style of music dark and deeper that made me remain in a repulsion towards those who presume well they still disgust me but at least thanks to those i was able to recognize more the things they talk about that surprised me by listening to them good recommendations no doubt but this record ok computer had come out of nowhere and i am surprised that it has still given me an extraordinary affection which then has caused me more interest in the band after that their first song it was not airbag but paranoid android that song that surprisingly identified me to an extreme degree by the simple fact of their transition from mystery to energy to humor and even i would say melancholy but then i realized that this project in general gave me that emotion after that it was even karma police and then no surprises karma police gave me as a feeling of sarcasm but at the same time hopelessness while no surprises well has given me the tone of the famous depression which is the one that hits me the most throughout the project now i can talk about the album in general it was clear that i would listen to their singles with those music videos and i must say it gave me an even more extraordinary journey than i expected to start off i removed the year on this album with the simple fact of being very meticulous in vocals and production that i can not even notice that the era it came out the opening track airbag a track that still makes me love the intro guitar too much plus the sound of bells in the background and then the drumming that gives great power with its produced and edited sound thoms vocals throughout this album have given me a great thought for their emotion and expression through these 12 songs which have made me obsess even more with this album for the lyrics that unite it completely paranoid android as i mentioned is the song that has given me a huge identity to me for the simple fact of the lyrics more than anything however in addition its instrumentation the three movements gave me a great trip to my own self with humor sarcasm anger and paranoia subterranean homesick alien at first i had a doubt if i really liked it but then i discovered it in a very short time i love its psychedelia in rhythm and distorted melody the calm he puts in a story that puts existentialism makes me laugh and at the same time i am interested after that calm i have to say that exit music for a film has made me wonder more with the way of this project with its acoustic melody that gives me a greater calm but then to give more power with its tone more technological in its production makes me feel in a huge fall i still could not believe what let down introduced me with that introduction the melody the stress of the lyrics the desolation in those vocals made me feel more hopeless than karma police a greater effect than i really expected karma police also said before had a more sarcastic feeling but that has kept me that emotion that gave me let down what i love the most about the theme is the keyboard at slow pace it makes me feel even calmer but if there is something that surprised me more it is simply with the arrival of fitter happier the disturbing lyrics a traumatic melody and with those robotic vowels only gave me a trauma for what is said could even say that i was scared by what i was dealing with which also gave me fear of the following to my personality until then electioneering appears you know i can not say i was disgusted at the first time because it was one of my most favorites on the record i can understand them to be the blandest with lesser production in the rest of this trip but i love the power of their alternative rock which gives me a great energy thanks to that it showed me the feeling of motivation more than anything even if it is a political issue i love his expression in it full of desire to say it all at once i love electioneering but even more i started to adore more this album with its next track climbing up the walls the psychopathy in this song made me shiver especially in its production full of dementia and harassment which makes me feel like the victim of the story and the scream at the end gave me chills to have a powerful end no surprises that theme comes from everything i heard is the one that hurts me let us just say if let down makes me feel hopeless no surprises puts me in a downward spiral although it has never existed in my life it gives me the feeling that i have it the song that goes towards tiredness and dissatisfaction gives great effect on one although clearly depending on your mood this song however i prefer to hear it with the rest of the album because the trip that puts me with this theme only makes me feel even less bad to hear it it will sound a bit terrible but in the end this is how the song made me feel the first time i heard it now it does not give me an enormous affection as mentioned above but it gives me a more pleasing love towards it for the production and lyrics after that comes lucky which gives me a feeling much less dense a little energetic but at the same time calm and with it i feel more relieved after that great trip that has given me this record i do not say much of this because it gives me a calmer and less hard pass this album has given me a great feeling paranoia stress sarcasm desolation energy tranquility and above all melancholy it has given me a great sense to my identity that makes me feel very grateful and best of all is how the tourist their last song made me see how in life anything happens the subject is about a driver angry at traffic probably will not make sense of what makes me feel but it gives me the perspective that the event will always happen and the only thing that needs to be done to solve it is to let it happen because it will happen in another time and that is what gives us the daily life the trip that has ok computer is what has given me a huge obsession with this album its density in its themes with that production vocals and lyrics the concept the 12 stories presented in it is the reason why it has given me such emotion to it and that is why it is my favorite of all time simply a beautiful album favorite track paranoid android,5.00,6680
not a lot to say here really everyone else has explained plenty about why it is good music all i have to add is that for me it was my very first step into a much larger world of music and as such i hold it very dear it was my first taste of truly experimental music music that was not safe music that pushed a few boundaries sure it may not be that wild in the grand scheme of things but before ok computer the strangest or most experimental stuff i had previously listened to would have probably beenwhat tame impala or sufjan stevens soyou can see how this blew my mind and a mind never really recovers from being blown like that,5.00,631
the contents of this boxset are a wet dream of every single radiohead fan never mind the remasters of the already genius alt rock record and sublime bsides there are three tracks that have gained a legendary notoriety status amongst people who lurked deadairspace and citizeninsane on a daily basis the first time i saw a tweet notification of oknotok happening i screamed in my car realizing that my beloved big boots will finally be released man of war is probably my second favorite radiohead track of all time second to only life in a glasshouse lift is revived in all of its glory i promise turned out to be the joy divisionesque gift thom has promised us in the 90s it is glorious even more shocking was the tape the cassette tape containing a big pile of 4tracks stems 2 unheard of songs early live versions and nigels musique concrete work that is just surreal for a person who has been obsessing over the histories and the formations of each single track in their discography this was the moment of overwhelming joy everything was so familiar yet so different it was like stumbling onto an old picture of yourself taken long ago that you had no recollection of there is something magical about finding out the source for nudes title hearing the early true love waits stems that ended up as the backbone of pulkpull revolving doors a 4track recording of the national anthem in its most rocknroll version combine all the auditory goodies with the thoms original ideas for the tracks from his sketchbookscountless insights into the world that was thought to be forever lost perfect really a complete dismantling of one of the greatest rock records ever made thank you thom yorke and the radioheads 1010,5.00,1708
i will not try to create an argument i do not want trouble we all need help now ok computer when i think of this album i think of time not that boring spacey time that some art rock albums try to explain but the era in which digital technology rose to common knowledge i was not even there i was not alive lol where was i not in heaven but i appreciate how influential this album was in the timely sense what i really like about this album is probably something that most people do not get at first it comes hand in hand with the rising population and the digital age but it also reminds me of when humans had just started being humans when there was nothing else in the world but them close your eyes relieve yourself of all your senses what will your human body actually do in this life maybe it will scramble around the earth occasionally reproducing or maybe your body is wasting away in your parents basement for an eternity do you ever actually grow up actually scratch that of course you grow up but how does your mind change you have knowledge and you have memory now but you are a lost child it does not matter what illusions you give yourself or what goals and paths in life you think you are following you are an animal but you are the most powerful one in the world and now you have a computer i never enjoyed computer programming or interfaces operating systems or most of the present internet it feels like a prototype a kind of first discovery of connecting humans across the world together where are you now and when did i write this i am a future person i looked at the past and said cool but i have a vision for the future in the new decade computers have started to control the smaller things in life do not freak out do you ever think there is a point where computers will become completely unbiased i believe its in space maybe its happening right now ok sorry enough simulation talk but think of it this way the stronger the connection between individual humans the better the world will be so i am communicating with my computer then but now i am communicating with you 9510,0.50,2097
everyone is favorite band with the possible exception of me since about 1998 or so this their magnum opus is the best thing they have ever done i still do not think much of it lots of alternate tunings and moody brian enolifted soundscapes with thom yorke alternately sighing andor howling over it what exactly is the appeal of this this is their best record by far i have heard them all ad infinitum from enthusiastic friends and acquaintances and i can suss out three decent songs and only a small number of good melodies the rest substitutes an unconventionally tuned guitar and repetitive riff along with spooky noise and yorkes wails in the place where most actually great bands usually put those things we call songs where are the songs here this begat shit like coldplay or radiohead for people without problems as i like to call them and i hold them responsible it is just tedious highest rated album on this website ever what a world,3.00,942
my friend was showing me this album and telling me how amazing it is i personally think this album is that incredible i guess the style just was not my thing i liked it but it was not amazing i liked subterranean homesick alien climbing up the walls no surprises and the tourist it took me a while to get into the album and i really never got sucked into the album sadly i disagree with rym i do not really think it was that amazing i think it was highly above average,3.00,468
straddles the line between being lyrically vague enough to convince the people who grew up on it that it is super deep dude while thematically onthenose enough to be obnoxious and resonate with the types of people who call everyone else sheep the albums everyone is like a cubicle robotesque subtext that is summarized on tracks like fitter happier made me realize that this album just was not for me i probably would have loved it about 4 years ago though for an album that was intended to be daring i felt it played it too safe and everything starts to feel the same about halfway in especially thom yorkes singing which is the worst offender of this whole album he sounds like a cat being strangled with piano wire at times and it gets headacheinducing real quick on an album that is supposed to be experimental and selfaware i wish he would not take himself so seriously with these brooding dramatic vocals probably the strongest contributor to my low rating of this album did not like it on the other hand paranoid android is a great fucking song and it is been stuck in my head for a while now,2.00,1099
radiohead seem to occupy this perfect space between pop music and true avantgarde music without really being either they are less experimental than they are recontextualizing pop music by incorporating moderate elements of the avantgarde thus keeping their sound interesting while still being accessible for more averagecasual listeners i think this is what causes them to garner so much hate from snobbier music fans because diehard radiohead fans proclaim radioheads music to be avantgarde artistic masterpieces and sure radiohead fanatics are definitely crazy but that does not mean the music is bad at all when you combine the popexperimental fusion of the music with thom yorkes absolutely beautiful angelic singing and the poetically emotional lyrics it is easy to see why radiohead and this album in particular have the status they do is it really the greatest album ever made no of course not but it is very very good,4.00,925
1 airbag when i am listening to ok computer all the way through and airbag starts up with that clear sharp lead guitar i get the same feeling of sitting in a movie theater right before the movie starts it is a combination of anticipation and a weird feeling of comfort knowing you are about to experience something a work of art that a bunch of talented people spent a lot of time and money making all for you to lose yourself in maybe that is a bit pretentious but the reputation of ok computer as the best album of all time along with its thematic overtones makes every listening experience a bit more elevated than what you get from your typical album oh the song itself is great that solo is pure rock grandeur balanced out with the dj shadow influenced distorted drumming and colin greenwoods eminently hummable bass when the guitar soars up in the second part of the solo it is the first of many moments of the album that send chills down my spine backtracking a bit i also love the way yorke holds off on singing the title of the song until the second verse dropping the catchphrase worthy line an airbag saved my life at the perfect moment right before he launches back into the chorus it is one of those omg he said the title moments you get more often from movies adding to the cinematic flavor of the song for me anyways also airbag gets points just for being one of the happiest radiohead songs truly triumphant and life affirming and then beep beep beep 2 paranoid android the first radiohead song that showed thom and crew were weirdos instead of just telling if you did not get it from that almost queasy guitar melody and backing rhythm section not even sure what instruments they are using to be honest yorke makes it obvious in his unborn chicken voices in my head line in the first verse and paranoid android just gets weirder and more intense from there i can get how the rock opera concept might sound corny to some it did to me at first but the aggressiveness sells it for me although sometimes it can still feel like a race to the third act meltdown by far my favorite section it is the narrator coming to his senses after letting out a torrent of anger and fear which gives the song some closure a similar thing happens on karma police a trip of a song if you are in the right mood for it 3 subterranean homesick alien as one of the more straightforward and almost playful songs on the album subterranean homesick alien functions as a bit of a breather in between two of the albums most melodramatic escapades in this song spacey guitars follow yorkes narrator as he drives his towns backcountry roads wishing he would get abducted by aliens it sounds like a cheeky concept for the band but there is an undeniably sad context that of the narrators social isolation and low self esteem the uptight of the chorus always struck me as yorke trying to force himself back into reality like he will be alright and will not have to daydream about aliens anymore if he would just let go of the neurotic behavior holding him back although it is not as heavy as some others there is still a general feeling of unease throughout the song will you really be alright man 4 exit music for a film there is always a sense of this is where shit gets real when i get to track number 4 on ok computer the quiet dread of acoustic guitar knowing what is to come yorkes pained intimate vocal and foreboding lyrics make the first half of exit music among the most atmospheric on the album the weird backing sample of what sounds like a distorted looped sample of a choir adds to the unease all of this tension is of course released with philip selways perfectly timed drum fill followed in suit by colin greenwoods fuzzy bass and his brothers lead guitar with yorkes emotional wailing riding this growing wave of sound surging towards catharsis the albums heaviest song emotionally with the lyrics being about the double suicide of two young lovers great but not always the easiest to listen to 5 let down so on an album where every song could function as the centerpiece on a lesser album there is no way the actual centerpiece could meet expectations or even work on a conceptual level to tie everything together right well i have held off until song 5 to state the obvious that all that can be said about this album has already been said and that anyone reading this has likely already heard this album many times probably and my review could not possibly offer any new analysis or insight so we already know the magic of let down a perfectly constructed pop song following a template that would be copied by many in coming years but with none of its imitators coming even close to the heights let down ascends to we know the feelings it inspires in us we know the comfort the song provides from those beautifully sentimental major key guitar and keyboards and yorkes simple yet directly emotional mantras surveying the malaise and disappointment of modern life it is that shared sense of disconnect that is hard to put words to naturally this is a difficult concept to pull off without either sounding pretentious and losing its emotional impact or sounding too sentimental and corny yet let down strikes the perfect balance this song has surely soundtracked many personal failures rejections losses empty feelings and useless chemical reactions be it from antidepressants or endorphins during a workout and hopefully it has also been that badly needed pickmeup with its silver lining mantra one day i am going to grow wings offering some perhaps knowingly naive hope but hope nonetheless 6 karma police now that sorrow turns to bitterness on the next track perhaps the albums most well known yorke is now calling for karma to hurry up and serve justice to those who talk in maths and don hitler hairdos so yeah he is being weird again but disconnect from reality is made even more palpable this all building to the great release in the final third of the song which is not so much carefully built up to like the climaxes of exit music or climbing up the walls but more a sudden switch change of pace like on paranoid android on a more personal note for some reason whenever i listen to this song in the gym i find it impossible not to lipsync with that phew for a minute there i lost myself section i have no idea why and i probably look like a twat but it is just too emotional which also leads me to another point maybe not brought up before about this album these songs are all great to lift weights to as they pretty much all feature progression and build up towards the most cathartic moment that emotional release that you can time your set to in fact i would say a song like exit music is optimally designed for lifting weights since you are at rest for most of the song until the final third explosion which you would time your set to try it out 7 fitter happier speaking of lifting weights well this interlude has long been considered the lowpoint of the album a useless and momentum killing dirge of a computerized voice reading off a paradigm of modern living that gets progressively weirder it is a rare moment on the album that i feel they are trying too hard to get their point across i mean it is short enough so as not to grate too much and i guess an interlude might be in order since the first half of this album was so emotionally draining but i wish they would have stuck an instrumental like the meeting in the aisle bside here instead not to suggest how to improve what is widely considered the greatest album of all time or anything 8 electioneering the most upbeat song on the album and another one that is maybe a bit too on the nose this time with political themes but still enjoyable for its catchy chorus and heck these lyrics are relevant today days as the president of my country is currently under an fbi investigation for his ties to russia and their hacking of our presidential election or simply because there is too much money in politics these days to begin with anyways a fine song that for its flaws still lends ok computer a wider context 9 climbing up the walls my second or third favorite radiohead song right here and my favorite from ok computer this is perhaps the sound of someone who has finally lost it completely as foreshadowed on subterranean homesick alien the lyrics are from the perspective of a stalker and are directed towards his victim in the chilling chorus either way you turn i will be there open up your skull i will be there the filter over yorkes vocal not unlike the one maynard james keenan used on stinkfist helps to mask his typically sweet distinctive singing voice and his high register emoting is pushed to the limit with that final scream the buildup to that climax sees johnny greenwoods brilliant string orchestration add a layer of cinematic tension to the claustrophobia the wailing guitar sounds like an alarm going off and those thunderous drums sound like what i imagine the hailstorm outside of the studio they were recording this song in must have sounded like the extended comedown is also chilling sounding like something off of boards of canadas geogaddi absolutely mental tune maybe not always the best song to listen to for someone with a penchant for obsessively thinking about certain people but this song represents the absolute opposite end of the spectrum of madness and insanity that one sometimes becomes morbidly curious to just take a peek at yknow like the old cliche that there is a sinister nature in all of us that thankfully is kept in check by societal norms healthy relationships etc well here it is a nightmare to be sure 10 no surprises and the nightmare ends with the warm childlike tone of glockenspiel softly waking us back to our normal lives or maybe i have just grown to associate the opening seconds of this song with waking up as i have used it as my alarm for the past year or so like let down this song utilizes sweet major key melodies despite its lyrical content being quite depressing this is the anthem for the emotionally vacant working class life and although yorkes lyrics are deeply sarcastic such a pretty house such a pretty garden they are concealing a lot of sadness and dissatisfaction the backing chant of get me outtta here great tune the video is also one of my all time favorites 11 lucky if no surprises was radioheads dark take on the beach boys then lucky is their pink floyd bid admittedly it is more straightforward than typical progressive rock and perhaps better off for it but those psychedelic guitars and grand solo sound straight out of the 70s art rock playbook this feels a bit airbaglite but it does stir some of the same triumphant emotions in its second verse especially the line it is going to be a glooooorious day i also love the lyric kill me sarah kill me again with love mostly because i have a soft spot for anytime an artist sings to an actual name yorke would do it again on the in rainbows bside go slowly oh maria 12 the tourist and so we reach the end of our journey through the various crises and stresses of modern life with another song centered around driving this time it is from the perspective of someone watching a reckless driver urging them to slow down i do not really have much to say about this song other than it has not quite grown on me like the other songs have but it is a good way to end the album i believe i read somewhere they were originally intending to include motion picture soundtrack which had been floating around since the bends era as the final song here well i am glad they had the sense to see it would not quite have fit on this album and especially glad they would swap the acoustic guitar for organ and harp when including it as the closer to their next album it is probably the most beautiful thing they have ever done but i am getting sidetracked the tourist i guess just is not very interesting to talk about since it is relatively straightforward alt rock with more guitar lines and emotional singing from yorke i will wrap up this monstrously long review by saying i absolutely 100 agree with ok computers reputation as the greatest album of all time it is not favorite not my even my favorite radiohead album but it just feels bigger and more important than any other record they would do like fuck man this is it they really did it,4.50,12337
artistic aspritations can be either a blessing or a curse sometimes they can be both employing such topics as transportation both inter and intraplanetary cruelty towards animals and insects and the encroaching technobureaucracy ok computer explores the effect of social control on the human mind  all while blurring the lines between rock song and film score a very welcome reprieve from the mundanity of most commercial rock music unfortunately the members of radiohead seem to have as much anxiety about their own instrumental competence as they have about everything else as a result they let every idea on this album get bogged down by studio ornamentation keeping the whole thing from meeting its appointed potential  that is as one of rock musics greatest antiseptics,3.00,774
what can i say about this album that has not been said a million times already this is such a culturally ingrained and beloved album and countless publications and critics have sung its praises and explained the cultural impact that ok computer has had on the genre of alternative rock and the world of music in general this is one of those rare albums that lives up to the hype and 21 years later has not lost any of its impact or sounded dated at all the themes of alienation from your fellow man due to the overabundance of technology and the dissatisfaction with society as a result of that has only grown stronger with time this is one of those albums that seems to be a personal favorite for many not only because the music is fantastic but because they have some attachment to it because of the time of their life they heard it during or how it helped them come to terms with their alienation from society or depression for me this album has always been cathartic as i have always felt detached from other people to some extent but this album found new meaning to me when it sort of soundtracked the beginning of the most important relationship of my life with a girl who accepted and loved me for everything i was regardless of my detachment from my fellow man enough about my views on the cultural impact or my personal attachment to the album for now let us get to the music which is absolutely fantastic this is a collection of 12 perfectly constructed tracks without a single lull even fitter happier works to build on the greater theme of the album as a whole we start off with airbag a great opener that sets the stage for what is to come the guitars are almost chilly as the drums work behind them to give the album a strange and multi layered introduction the guitar work really is something to behold right out of the gate as various layers of different guitar lines are seamlessly put on top of each other to create a great soundscape and this is only the first track next we have what many have considered alternatives bohemian rhapsody paranoid android this song carries on the soundscape elements of the first track at least in the first part of the song backed up by the monotonous robotic voice found in fitter happier the mix up into the raw and explosive rif throughout the middle of the track and the subsequent winding down into a beautiful and off putting chorus in the background of thom singing about rain falling from a great height never ceases to amaze me this is probably the most popular song on the album and for good reason it never has lost its impact even after at least 50 listens of it over all my times revisiting this album after that track comes to a close we have the atmospheric and psychedelic subterranean homesick alien a track that sounds like floating through the great cosmic clouds of a supernova while missing home the miles davis influence on this song is pretty clear as the whole track has undertones of jazz fusion and abstraction throughout the instrumental choices and mood that the choices leave you with the track always gives me a sense of wonder and alienation in the same way thom talks about this alienation throughout the lyrics of the track next we have the seminal and ever sad track exit music for a film a song made famous by its use at the end of baz luhrmanns romeo and juliet and more recently at the end of the black mirror episode shut up and dance this track is probably the saddest and most chilling track on the entire album the chilling nature of this song is even reflected in the lyrics as thom says sing us a song to keep us warm there is such a chill such a chill the song is gentle for the first half but still carries a strong mood into the end where the background is filled by strange sounds that brings the mood even further down until it just explodes into a even more chilling and intense crescendo of haunting emotion it never fails to send a shiver down my spine and is the perfect ending of a song to transition into my favorite song on the album and favorite radiohead song of all time  let down i could write an entire article about why i love let down but i will keep it as short and succinct as i can the guitars are so breathtakingly beautiful and play in different time signatures against each other as the drums drive them forward the vocals on the other hand are so beautiful and complementary to the chilling instrumental that the two go together like bread and butter this is what radiohead has always been best at in my opinion they quickly establish a complex yet emotionally impactful mood that they can gradually work upon to perfection and reach a high that leaves you speechless and in awe of the incredible craftsmanship you have just heard thoms lyrics reflect what it is like to be such a small insignificant human in a world of transportation people going to all kinds of places and the world moving so fast as you stand so still and the disappointment that comes from feeling separate from this infinitely complex world of individuals attempting to get places he uses a metaphor of a bug getting crushed in the ground to extend this feeling of emptiness into the fact that our insignificance and expectations are often too sentimental for our own good and end up being worthless drivel the end of this song after the instrumental winds down is honestly one of my favorite moments in music the combination of the guitars coming back in in full force the building and thoms vocals soaring over the top on top of himself is absolutely gorgeous the part where he hits that perfect falsetto always gets me despite this songs lyrics sentimental and sends wave after wave of shivers down my spine i am also not afraid to say this song has gotten me emotional more than once overall this track is absolutely my favorite radiohead song and one of the best moments in music in the 90s and the climax of the album and the most flawless song to be the climax as well the next few songs are great with karma police being another incredibly famous song from the album which continues the strong mood of the record fitter happier always gives me shivers too but mostly because the mood is so disturbing and reflective of how uniform and horrifying the idea of always trying to stay happy and meet the status quo can be we are all expected to follow all of these rules towards what makes us a good member of society when ultimately all it does is restrict us make us less individualistic and distract us from the fact that the system is fucking us all while making it seem like we benefit from it it has a great message but sometimes i cannot really face the song as the mood it puts me in is to opposite to the one i get from the next track electioneering which is probably the best straight up rock song on the album and it always gets my blood pumping electioneering and climbing up the walls are two great songs with great production but as songs the stick out the least to me on the tracklist because the other tracks are so standout in comparison no surprises is another standout single from this album it contrasts the lullabyesque quality of the instrumental and vocals versus the antagonistic and cynical lyrics about the destructive effect of our endless and demeaning jobs as the government decides everything for us we should stand up for ourselves but in this world it is often too much to ask for people to become impassioned enough to change so we just passively deal with the cycle of a life where nothing we do matters and no one cares a great single and transition into my second favorite track on the album lucky lucky is a lot of things for me it is a sad dirge of a song with guitars that wail almost like they are crying and a vocal performance and lyrics that sound pretty much hopeless but it is also a song that connects me to one of the most passionate moments of my life it was a bitter cold saturday in wisconsin despite the fact that it was mid april we had just had a huge blizzard and even though it was hugely impractical i was set on seeing the girl i had been dating i met her on a greyhound bus and had developed such a strong bond with her that even mountains of snow in the road was not going to stop me from seeing her we drove to the mall and listened to this album in the parking lot and during our listen we passionately made out during this track and the tourist this girl would go on to be the first serious relationship i have had in 4 years and is my current girlfriend so lucky is our song it is our song by circumstance but i think that the fact that this song ended up being our song is not to make a pun lucky lucky really captures the feelings i for over a year before i met her and i felt the desolation of this tracks lyrics i just wish someone could have pulled me out of the suffering of my life and she did the tourist is the best ending to this album that anyone could have asked for and i honestly think it is the most underrated song on the album by far it is so hauntingly beautiful and reflective it is such a fitting ending to the album as a whole the album started off with a bang and ends on a reflective melancholic little tune that i think captures what ok computer is about wistful reflection on the alienation of your life perfectly matched to grand yet sentimental and chilling cerebral instrumentals ok computer is not just my favorite radiohead album it is one of my all time favorite albums to ever be released my man the fact that it is number 1 on this site makes a lot of sense as it is obvious to me that this album is most important to those who see that music can change your life that it is not just something to put on in the background the album has rightfully been remembered by history for what it is one of the most important albums of all time a decade defining and momentous peak of what alternative rock was and still is and one of the ideals of what music can achieve it is one of the few albums i would say is absolutely perfect and i would recommend anyone trying to get into music beyond what their friends and family listen to give this masterpiece a listen it is absolutely an essential listen for everyone,4.50,10197
what could really be said about this album almost too much at this point my criteria for rating albums is actually rather simple so i try to ignore as much of the hysteria good and bad surrounding an album like this this album generally has beautiful songs with beautiful and lush production this album also possesses a strange sort of cohesiveness that is unusual developing as a kind of cohesive story from the general alienation in the first half to the surreal and metaphysical ballads after electioneering verdict 710 good will give a listen on occasion 35 stars,3.50,567
i cannot add anything else to this album that everyone else has not said already that or i am just lazy ooo i got a new hit on my facebook page,5.00,143
difficult to listen to and not relevant if you are not depressed in some way there is a heavy handed message of the world around you is an evil place that is meant to kick you down without mercy this is taken to such a degree that it reaches the point of being pathetic truly the easiest thing one can do is blame the world instead of themselves outside of this the actual musical content ranges from good to amazing the songs are enveloping and loud and very detailed throughout there is so much information being transmitted and the loud textured noise leaves such a massive footprint that one cannot help but feel exhausted after listening to the entire thing while this is a classic i would not recommend it to anyone who is not flat out depressed it will not have much of an impact on you as stated previously the music is good but it is not like there are not other albums that do a similar thing and better 35,3.00,916
this is one of very few albums that i think has a tracklist where every song is good it was perfect for the turn of the century and a rushing of humanity into the digital age perfect for a solemn drive out on the road though it makes me think of car crashes the album is beautifully sad in many ways i will not sit here and interpret all the songs though i feel bad for anybody who cannot appreciate it even the nonmusical track fitter happier fits well into the mood of the album amazing obviously recommended and hopefully stands the test of time i have listened to this album at my darkest times and it is made me cry at different times throughout it and sucks the warmth from me it is cold has made me think of dying at times and yet throws you straws of life just barely to grasp to and then it loops over and over,5.00,819
is ok computer grossly overrated probably is ok computer the greatest album of all time who is to say is ok computer still a flawless 10 yeah duh,5.00,145
radioheads ok computer has already been examined reexamined and assessed ever since it arrived in 97 there is really not much for me to say about this album i really like it and let down is my favorite radiohead song that they have written is this album overrated yes is it still a tremendous effort in its own right yes do i ask myself easy questions so i sound really smart like dwight yes this is not an album that will amaze you on the first listen it rewards the listener with multiple spins great album and one of my top 3 radiohead records along with the bends and in rainbows how i made my millions and lull are both fantastic bsides that should be sought after,5.00,669
up to 4 i still find that ok computer does not deserve its gold medal in the top rym i consider it slightly overrated and i think i will never worship it as much as many music lovers more broadly radiohead will probably always be somewhat hermetic to me nevertheless there is one thing that i have to admit all the songs on this disc are excellent each is teeming with details and achieves its objective without difficulty whether it be to soothe to escape to move to surprise there is an ethereal atmosphere that hovers over this disc which is quite charming when i listen to it i also have the impression of being plunged into a cloud everything is a little hazy distant sometimes cold but beautiful certainly i will not detail all the titles but there would clearly be something to write about let down is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful things i know the famous hits that are no surprises lucky karma police and the barred paranoid android what a ufo totally deserve their success more subtle airbag exit music and climbing up the walls are real successes i even like the cybernetic interlude fitter happier which even goes straight to a more classic electroneering but which stirs it all up nicely in short this big 90s classic gradually opened up to me a great experience,4.00,1283
there is nothing bad with pretentious art as long as the artist fulfill his pretension ok computer deserves bombastic crowns it is universal it is futuristic it is well made to it is smallest details but it is music and lyrics are rarely reach the high standards that the themes deserves the main theme of the album is the scifi motive of cyborg the humancomputer combination which is the theme of some of the best popular records like laurie andersons big science and kraftwerks computer world and the man machine here the manmachine oxymoron is mostly expressed with the dialog between warm rock ensemble lead by jonny greenwoods guitar and electronic instruments pads and effects the combination is often tiring with too dominant guitar and unoriginal use of the effects like the stupid vocoder in fitterhappier with it is formulary text and the annoying whining guitar parts and solos in lucky and in climbing up the walls sometimes it works especially in the less heavy tracks of the album when the guitar is less takingover and the electronic parts are based on quiet pads or small touches followed by smooth keyboards like in beautiful let down classic karma police and worn yet touching no surprises and paranoid android in which the acoustic guitar takes the part of the keyboard theses tunes express perfectly the melancholy alienated feeling that the suicidal cliches in the lyrics of exit music for instance fail to reach the lyrics of the album however are rarely understood because of thom yorkes floatingspreading singing that a whole generation of rockers tried to duplicate in a despair attempt to reach rym top 100 the album contains one pearl that stands in the front of radiohead resume airbag is based on an amazing drum riff that in a way is opposite to the beat of the melody especially the thrilling tremolo guitar verse and thom yorkes slow melody this conflict is radiohead secret weapon it makes radioheads best songs masterpieces especially some of the songs in kid a king of limbs and in rainbows the tremolo makes the song the riff is brilliant the solo and the effects are fantastic and the whole song is a display of greenwood at his top the lyrics are only a cover subtextless and direct declarations that express the yearning for a new birth an interstellar burst as a mechanic person the music is filled with passion for renewal and express perfectly not only the pre millennium atmosphere but radioheads rebirth as a postbritpop electronic ensemble radiohead has surely designed the sound of the new decade but two months after the release of ok computer a new album has released a perfect masterpiece that represented far more innovative combination of electronic and nonelectronic music homogenic by bjork,3.50,2743
attention multiaward winning outsized album defying time for cult band led by an enchanting singer the best of his time tom yorke adored by millions of fans and without a doubt the best alternative rock record of the 90s to this day from the beginning airbag through the incredible pessimistic paranoid android to karma police are real nuggets of modern rock art and what about subterranean alien let down climbing up the walls i have never heard such musically ethereal bewitching and what about tourist lucky no surprises majestic exhilarating exit music is simply magnificent the b sides are of the same quality just listen to promise man of war ok computer is more than a reference album it is the creative culmination of contemporary music the bedside album the album to have and never give up  the precious absolute thank you tom y thank you jonni g thank you philip s thank you ed o thank you colin g for this wonderful mythical gem,5.00,939
in some alternative universe i freaking love this album it is liquid melodies subtly but well timed basslines and that singer  damn that guy can make me feel but  that is not this universe not this reality at parties bars social gatherings i am the ugly duckling that just cannot understand how amazing this album is i just do not maybe and deep breath here i may not even really like radiohead do not get me wrong i love blur i love sigur ros i love alot of great great things but not this i honestly think it is that bloke on the microphone oddly i look up every new release i am what you might consider aware of it is social pull it is like some citizen kane for me i know it is supposed to be great but for me it is just there basically elevator music for the radio,0.50,769
i get the love and acclaim for this album the mixing and the arrangements the violins on climbing up the walls are gorgeous and lambent exemplifying a level of attentiveness that must have felt like a breath of fresh air in the late 90s but like so many with progressive tendencies they forget that craftsmanship and technical mastery are not everything thom yorkes lyrical melodrama is among the most lacking in this regard running the gamut from the hamfisted as on fitter happer to the laughable  is the idea of yuppies networking really so horrifying as to necessitate his yelps of despair to be sure bleakness and alienation come part and parcel with postmodernity but yorke and the boys never quite evoke any such feelings instead settling for a vague gesturing that leaves me unmoved maybe i am just not in on the joke and the overall tepidness of the album is supposed to symbolize the overall tepidness of the postindustrial first world if that is irony there is no joy to it  and why should i care about that c,0.50,1020
quick intake of breathok here goes i am going to take on the behemoth rate your musics number one album the much loved much discussed ok computer apparently not only radioheads finest album but considered one of the greatest albums of all time first off i have lived with ok computer since it is release way back in the nineties i was the perfect age for radiohead 26 years of age a musician and songwriter and already a fan of the band thanks to creep and previous album the bends so why is it i have always had something of a lukewarm relationship with the bands most acclaimed work maybe it is a little too close to progressive rock a genre i have never loved completely in it is sound design and reach sure the songs are for the most part much more focused and melodic than those i usually find in most prog but the production definitely has the feel of say pink floyd for quite a while i felt that this was my one bug bear with ok computer for an album that seems to be wanting to draw me in with it is emotional pull it is awfully cold and calculated and dare i say it a little overblown yet as i have lived the last 20 years with ok computer i have grown to realize that my main gripe with ok computer is not really the suffocating production rather it is the quality of the songwriting on show it is easy to see why ok computer is so loved it is beautifully sequenced and musically it is nigh on perfect unlike most of those prog bands radiohead very rarely stray off into pointless interludes that serve only to show us their musical abilities always serving the song perfectly the guitars in particular always seem to hit the right note find the right texture and colour these songs in a way few other bands are able to i just wish the songs were less inconsistent and that the album had more tone than the grey that seems to strangle it from first note to last almost every song here is mid to slow tempo and coupled with yorkes nasally whine can get a little hard to get through the run from subterranean homesick alien through to electioneering is pretty tough going for me the last song is the only genuine rocker on the whole record but it sounds like filler to these ears the verses do not engage me and that chorus is a damp squib in between we get a spoken word piece called fitter happier that gets irritating about 30 seconds in exit music for a film aims for devastating melancholy but comes across like self absorbed whining let down is even mopier and subterranean homesick alien is just plain dull with perhaps the albums worst chorus which leaves the excellent karma police easily one of the albums best tracks like opener airbag it has a menacing slightly unhinged feel to it that suits the band much better than the wallowing in misery found elsewhere however both tracks are nearly ruined by the bands artistry and refusal to finish a song without a hail of feedback andor sound effects they do this at least half a dozen times on this album and i am bored already by the second time they do it paranoid android is rightly hailed as one of the albums high points it contains everything great about radiohead it is a complex piece of many segments that never seems unfocused every part perfectly woven together melodically and lyrically perfect i think it is the highlight of their career singles wise and remains one of my favourite singles of all time for a song this challenging this intelligent to top the uk singles chart still fills me with joy and i really like the albums run in climbing up the walls is nearly ruined by another annoyingly pointless end and the tourist gets dangerously close to overblown 70s rock histrionics in it is close out although that ping is cool it has to be said but the former mixes a bit of a portishead massive attack and tricky vibe to great effect whilst the latter has one of the albums best melody lines and there is nothing at all wrong with either the utterly gorgeous no surprises which contains the albums prettiest melody or the neil youngcrazy horse like lucky there is absolutely no doubting radioheads talent or grasp of melody and ok computer has these traits writ large all over it but this is the number one album on rate your music and i feel the mid section of the album is a bit of a slog and less than perfect from a songwriting perspective hence my above average rating still it is well better than most classic albums out there,3.50,4414
pop art pop ok computer admired to idolatry to fanaticism an obsession for a whole generation a more than deserved obsession for the most hypertrophied album of the 90s between the media hype that raised it to the altars since it came out and the emotional hype for what it has meant to so many people it is impossible to clarify and get an accurate idea of what what ok computer is and how authentic it is the same does not happen with its tentacles that sink without hiding it in the depths of popular culture be it the highest or the most vulgar the album and the group do not hide their influences it would be stupid there is the trace of that hitchhikers guide to the galaxy a british series that lends him his paranoid androids and gives him a title that bitches brew by miles davis that they tried to invoke in subterranean homesick alien title inspired by one of bob dylan by the way but that came out more like the beatles that bohemian rhapsody queen in which they say they were inspired for the changes of paranoid android and so many other references that boiled in the heads and hands of a group shown here about to explode this was only his third album a little early perhaps to squander the melodic inspiration the expressive skill and the concept that lies in this work surprising especially when we get carried away and enjoy the enormous amount of detail it has which are what make it so great that halfplayed bass which shuts up when it should not almost dub from airbag the guitar broken by the distortion that splits paranoid android in two the mellotrons here and there the suicidal calm of exit music for the film romeo  juliet by baz luhrmann the melodic change in karma police two songs in one that can make me levitate the lost piano of fitter happier the radical distortion of electioneering  the terminal paucity of climbing up the walls the music box melody of no surprises that we are standing on the edge that falls out of thoms exhausted mouth and so many details that make this album unique and worthy of all your unconditional adherence much has been said about his concept and the ideas he tries to convey this topic is not trivial because perhaps that is the key to understanding why it has connected so well with the public when let us not forget its sales in the us were underestimated a priori it was not a commercial album they said but that did not matter because what counts reaches our soul ok computer tells us about ourselves at the difficult turn of the century it attacks consumerism the superficiality of relationships a robotic world that dehumanizes and alienates all on an album in which thom yorke boasted that he had put aside the negativity of his previous work in pursuit of a positivism that i just do not see very clearly ok computer has its place among the greats and neither ballard nor the velvet underground other major influences can explain this surely it is because it is a serious and solid work one of those who believes what counts and he believes it because what counts is important and essential for our lives because it is not background music but demands our full attention and we are always going to lend it to him even though he may sound finicky in his melodic games and in the vocal counterpoints of thom yorkes crybaby because despite his imperfections we like the bastard to the point of saying enough,5.00,3378
this is probably the last album that radiohead made where they still made obviously melodic music ok computer lies halfway between the oddities of art rock and the accessible styles of somewhat different alt rock compare anything on this to the following two albums and the wellexplored difference is astounding but that aside ok computer still manages to be as listenable as the bends but clearly leaning towards a lessmelodic form music ultimately it does this altartrock style impeccably,4.50,490
frankly i did not immediately get a taste of ok computer for myself  and it is not about unusual head music i already enjoyed kid a the bends in rainbows it is not about excesses of taste and even more so not about mood  rather general excitement phrases pop up here and there that this is the best album of the 90s alternative music in general and radiohead in particular which caused me great surprise well where is the electronic champs elysees of kid a where is the minimalistic beauty of in rainbows where is the complete unpredictability and beautiful absurdity of hail to the thief in general i was ready to listen to it with pleasure once or twice but i completely disagreed and perhaps still do not agree with the fact that this magnum opus and the peak of radiohead is rather their quintessence the core of the style which they will decorate in every possible way and roll from one steppe to another over the next twenty years there are great songs perhaps the best of their work and indigestible perhaps the worst of their work  what people throw at friends when they ask them about radiohead this is a really beautiful and impressive album with its own atmosphere which may have been considered a masterpiece at that time but over the next couple of decades the band managed to write and surpass it at least twice,4.50,1325
you do not remember you do not remember why do not you remember my name to which i reply oh of course i fucking do i will always remember the name of this masterpiece ok computer is one of those albums where the music counts just as much as the entire experience seriously from the front to the back there will be some sort of mood or some sort of memory you will feel or recall starting with airbag about thom yorkes car accident when he was younger this album slowly begins to take off and pull you in if you enjoy this band or their counterparts you will be sucked right in and enjoy the hell out of it just like me but if you are a casual or different genre listener or a first timer you will probably be impressed with airbag slightly but will take a while to sink in but by the last strike of jonnys guitar at the end of the song boop boop boop boop paranoid android happens and it happens oh it happens this song will most definitely grab you by the hand and yank you into the world of yorke  co this song was and still is the bohemian rhapsody of the 90s and was definitely another massive leap away from their debut and think about all those people who say radiohead croon too much you are wrong son this track is most definitely one you will never forget as well as the rest of this album the truth is paranoid android is a mixture of everything good an acoustic intro some cool basslines a guitar seizure a ballad and a balls to the wall climax this song has everything and anything trust me you will not find this anywhere else in alternative rock unless you are muse i am looking at you citizen erased  then the third song kicks in subterranean homesick alien which makes you feel as if you are floating or hovering above the earth i listened to this song just before i watched some people skydive and the two just click together so well this song is brilliant and most certainly not uptight after this we get the first real slower and more melancholy track of the album exit music for a film this song is just so depressingly sad and really pulls on those good old heartstrings but in ways this song is also very mysterious and scary plus the fact it hints there is another track on the album like this climbing up the walls the we hope that you choke line is really really deep let down arrives afterwards and is a very bittersweet addition to what has already been a journey of a record the bleeps and the bloops at the end of the previous song continue into karma police one of the most recognisable radiohead songs and also one of their strongest songs ever the lyrics the melody the corruption of the synthkeyboard at the end it just all fits together perfectly and beautifully in fact i would say it was one the strongest singles of the 90s and of all time this corruption leads into a microsoft samlike voice in fitter happier a computernarrated poem about life as a human and normal things but in ways really seems quite dark it is the bit in the album you just cannot miss next up electioneering a bouncy smithslike song with some very big messages underneath and yes this is rocking it is mental and that is one of the ways i like it but nextis a turning point this album seems to have gone through talking scenes of society life people struggle depression and accidents but the next song you will experience is climbing up the walls which is fucking terrifying it is such an awesome song but i would not listen to it at 2 am in the morning for fucks sake the toys in the basement line is just very creepy and unnerving i like this song a lot for its unsettling atmopshere and the screams at the end this may be the scariest rh song period the somewhat nightmare song of the album is followed by a daydream and once again another heartstring puller no surprises another instantly loveable track and a fanfavourite this song sticks out in its pure relatableness and its emotion yorke is basically pretending he is saying his last goodbyes here and it is really touching a piece of art followed closely by lucky another song about a crash this time an aircrash the album begins to decend into its final moments the final moment comes in the form of the touristthis song is so unbelievably hopeful and gorgeous in its very soothing instrumentation and powerful climax happiness is the key to actually enjoy any part of this song whilst i would say it is most certainly the happiest song on ok computer it is also the second strongest after paranoid android and along with it one of my favourite and instantly relatable songs of all time ever if you have not heard this album yet go hear it now it is choice and it will be a fantastic one you will make to do it 55 ding,5.00,4689
this is where radiohead really started to experiment it is also the peak of radiohead but this is no insult to the other albums  in rainbows the bends and even hail to the thief are all insanely good albums even if they each have one or two flaws ok computer on the other hand is practically flawless now i find subterranean homesick alien to be a little weak and i am not a fan of fitter happier but even that talking piece fits perfectly within the album there are often transitions between songs and they are very very effective my one true critique is that lucky is the ultimate album closer perhaps i am alone in thinking this but the song may be the best radiohead song in existence sure it is not as gorgeous as let down as spectacular as paranoid android as gorgeous as pyramid song or as powerful as 2  2  5 but its essence is unavoidable it is the kind of song that wakes hidden strength within it is a motivator without being a pumpup song it is an emotional safeguard that promises that things will be fantastic the tourist while an incredible song is too much of a downer for lucky i am not sure if they could just be flipped effectively but putting it somewhere else in the album would probably fix this what makes ok computer so good exactly like the bends the humanity of radiohead is firmly on display  but this time it is distorted there is an electronic distortion in the mirror and our reflection seems a little lost in the chaos of life the album moves sometimes it is a brilliant shimmering light sometimes it is the madness that lurks within sometimes it is the fears that twist the things around us there is not a resolution  not exactly instead there is a catharsis of sorts as the music flows through your brain ok computer has the unfortunate effect of making other incredible albums seem bad radiohead has never matched it and probably never will but that is okay we only truly need one ok computer and we have it,5.00,1941
i am extremely lucky to have experienced it is impact when it first released in 1997 i have never heard of this band before the received the grammys i went straight to the nearest cd store to buy it i did not get their music in the first listen but this is the magic of this piece of art the more i listen the more it grow inside me this is an album that changed the way how i see music,5.00,386
i have a lot of nostalgia for this album because while i was growing up my dad played this a lot this album right here is one of the best of all time radiohead took big risks for this they decided to change from their normal style to add more electronic on the album the tracks were sometimes experimental at the time this was realeased it had a smart and cohesive theme that talked about the society that the band lived in there were more emotions on this album abd it was more sad i loved it this had never been done before it changed the band made them explore new stuff while still being good with their audience and even bieng better than ever every track is different and has its purpose to the album the songs are fabulously written this band is so smart and creative it contains songs that will forever stay in my mind but it is not perfect it could be it is so close to being perfect but some songs have small parts that can annoy me or just be boring sometimes like the toutist and let down but the little bit that is bad is always erased by wonderful songs such as paranoid android exit music for a film climbing up the walls and lucky the lyrics contain more metaphors and more interesting stories than ever before i cannot believe the time and effort that had been put in this album to make it sound this amazing beautiful and unique simply one of the best albums of all time,4.50,1388
the heavynoisy build up on some of the opening tracks of this album may very well be an acquired taste not quite unlike oasis be here now also released 1997 the slick guitar bends and grooves on represented by electioneering and the refined jangle on no surprises and let down show where bands like the coral and the stands took their queues from listen to bill mccai and nearer than green for instance you heard me right forget what professional reviewers has to say about those beatle chaps it was radiohead all along their refined rhythm and rich texture are realisations of ideas crosby and mcguinn was aiming for on fifth dimension 1966 but never quite achieved on ok computer radiohead are really bringing it all home it is brilliant they take on all kinds of influences and still deliever a full fledged sound radioheads ok computer is layered in production and not as easy listening as say pablo honey and it may sound strange that the peculiar short little sound collage fitter happier that features only synthesised vocals is in fact a creative high point of the album and with ok computer creativty and sincerity of purpose is what you have in abundance yes you heard me and i am 100 serious it is all in the atmosphere and pathos i know you are still thinking of those sharp edges but put plainly they are a bit of the whole package and once you are into it you would not want to trade it for the whole world it plays soft and clean on double vinyl too try it on headphones with the volume not too loud and you will hear many different nuances on the same songs,5.00,1573
ok computer is a triumphant musical achievement by radiohead their third album a work consisting of a core of very solid altrock steeped in art and experimentation is without a doubt one of the greatest albums ever made radioheads discography has other albums i would consider flawless it may not evoke the sheer wonder that kid a does or be as oddly comforting and transcendent as in rainbows but in terms of emotional impact catharsis and depth ok computer takes the cake each track perfectly fits the album even fitter happier and very few other albums are able to fit this claim this album defines the turn of the millennium the opening track airbag sets the stage beautifully radiohead has a way of making the first notes of their albums some of the most memorable and here is a prime example lyrically thom yorke sets up a beginning a rebirth the bass motif the jangle of the guitars the slightly distorted drums and the sporadic noise bursts all set the tone for the album they expertly transition into paranoid android a sixandahalf minute progressive epic a hallucination of grandeur comprising of several sections each with different tones tempos and time signatures while remaining cohesive this track shows a character both fearful and angry anticipating conspiracy and lashing out against perceived threats the fact that a band can put such a sprawling song together in such a seamless way is nothing short of spectacular the third track subterranean homesick alien again returns with fear a new character a marooned alien pines for his home after spending time on earth here a theme of escapism becomes apparent the spacious effects on the guitars are tasteful and frankly impressive side b begins with exit music for a film starting with a few sparsely strummed chords filled with despair tension builds as instruments are added the climax of the song sees the bass go wild the drums kick in and a choir to back up thom in a simply heart shattering manner escape is in sight the songs fades back out to just the sparse guitar strumming thom and the choir enter let down one of the most beautiful transcendent songs in existence as thom aspires to grow wings he acknowledges that this is impossible and that he will only be crushed like a bug the layered harmonies at the climax of the song are like the sound of redemption itself karma police a great song about paranoia and a dire future follows it is and instantly recognizable chord progression then fitter happier this interlude is often the butt of jokes but i truly believe it ties the album together it describes what would be a logical ideal human but the voice reminds us that flaws are human side c kicks off with electioneering a song that describes corruption and the control of the world alongside a fiery jam of a song climbing up the walls another personal favorite describes insanity paranoia and a mind devouring itself the outro features one of the most unique uses of strings in pop music heavily inspired by krzysztof penderecki and leaves the auditory equivalent of a smoldering bed of hot coal in its wake no surprises the most beautiful and melodic song ever written about suicide follows the narrator commits suicide with carbon monoxide poisoning and dies in a fit of euphoria reflected in the tone of the song lucky and the tourist close out the album as side d which is a triumph in art any person who has been driven to consider suicide will be especially effected by the kafkaesque world of the album but will be inspired by the music itself to live if only to attempt to create some piece of art even approaching this album in quality the world is often drab dull depressing and spiteful but if we manage to escape the cycle of self imprisonment somehow we will find out pretty house and pretty garden ok computer is a work of art that every musician and songwriter strives to match in power,5.00,3886
great album some tracks are a lot stronger than others but it gets a lot of points for innovation and uniqueness one of the most creative albums ever made well ahead of its time it seems like everyone has a different favorite track from this album but in my mind nothing beats paranoid android lucky comes close though aside from those be sure not to miss karma police or no surprises in fact do not miss any of it it is a highly enjoyable album that will impress most who hear it and bonus it annoys contrarians ,4.00,513
maybe tom yorkhe was or is really a sombre guy but the funny thing is that in twelve songs he fatigues to express his feelings his lyrics are confused and not in the positive michael stipes way he whines random sad stuff but without the capacity to hit the listener in the soul well maybe it is a my problem seen the votes of this album on rym as a sad guy myself i never really felt a whole day turned off in certain moments a will of burn the world and an anger for everyone starts to boil in my veins and then like always i return to calm down in loneliness i think yorke misses this thing he is always sad and hazy unlike the sudden rage of a kurt cobain just to say ironically the only lyrics i really loved are the wonderful critiques to society contained in fitter happier the nonsong of the album i do not love this album for his sound for his choking of great melodies and sensations in a sea of cold water it is really something that i do not get maybe again it is me but after all i would be dumb saying that is not a very good album a one that is amusing to listen from time to time a more than average album produced in that beautiful decade that were the nineties but the best album ever ehm absolutely no,3.50,1219
1 limedibagels review is the only review of the album you will ever need case in point calling this album the best of 1997 is accurate calling this album the best of the 90s is perfectly reasonable calling this album the best of all time is embarrassing 2 if you accept the above statement you may stop reading this review now if not carry on 3 this albums status is understandable if not deserved it is the culmination of numerous rock electronic and jazz influences throughout the sixties seventies and eighties coming together to form a seamless whole that is at once innovative and respectful of its source material i cannot think of a better middle ground between the worlds of eno floyd the beatles and miles davis despite this it is not even remotely derivative and manages to bring all sorts of neat touches to these ideas that make it feel brand new the cello in airbag playing in tandem with the electric guitar and the way the sleigh bells in the background immediately invoke winter and set the tone for the rest of the album just for one example 4 the fact of the matter is that despite how good the album is and how talented the group is radiohead fanboys are really something huh i cannot imagine how many of us here must have been initially turned away from radiohead by all their sniveling worshipful cronies not saying every fan is a fanboy but seriously if you do that shit just know that you are probably ruining the band for someone jerk but that is nothing to do with the music is it 5 the music is great front to back stellar no question absolutely stunning lyrics are great too production is lush and both claustrophobic and panoramic at once bleep bloops guitars bass keyboards etc what do you even say about this album overanalyzed is what this is there is nothing left to pick over and dissect and why would you want to anyways it is real real good really great top 10 best albums yep but not the best all the artists i mentioned before have at least one album i would put above this one on a top 10 even so it is really special is not it last thought the tourist is incredible people who say it is a weak closer probably think paranoid android is the highlight of the whole album it is exactly the kind of catharsis the album needs to slow down and end on a gorgeous moving piece that ties everything neat up like a bow also that ding does not mean shit calm down guys,5.00,2396
why are we listening to this fucking depressing music i shouted exasperated and upset hitting the stop button on my stereo with dramatic force susan could not answer the question just like she could not unbreak my heart or continue to love me i was 17 she was 17 and she was my first love we were in my bedroom in my parents home one afternoon after school the sun was beginning its descent and in the street outside other kids were enjoying the summer evening i was not i was breaking up with my first girlfriend for the most impossible of reasons things were not working out we had grown apart there was no resolving it ok computer played in the background and in an effort to make a dramatic demonstration of my sadness i had a little outburst of fury and silenced it at the climax of exit music imitating some kind of hate towards it i was oblivious at that moment to the notion that it was in fact my friend and throughout the remainder of that evening and for many weeks and years afterwards it was the only thing that made sense in a world of hormones and emotions that did not it is everpresent throughout a mixture of strange memories from my teenage years for a few months following our breakup susan and i continued to see each other convincing ourselves that friendship was still possible but often we would still yearn for each other or at least i would for her and she would oblige with diminishing enthusiasm until one very sorry day she wanked me off disinterestedly on my futon with all of her clothes still on as if she was doing a favour to a dying man we stopped seeing each other soon after that disappointment and uncertainty crept into my consciousness with regularity and i yearned for the melancholic familiarity that ok computer offered my dad dismissed the album as depressing music and i agreed but thinking that i was depressed rather than just a normal hormonal teenager i liked it even more for that its worldview and outlook for the world outside seemed bleak and i liked that because at that uncertain time that is how the future seemed to me scary unmanageable and bleak perhaps time and experience taught me differently and perhaps reshaped my opinion not only of ok computer but of life also the moment in the final verse of let down where the two intertwining vocal parts collide and swirl into a final chorus is so unbelievably beautiful so elating that it has brought me to tears of both happiness and of regret thoms resolution for the tragic dilemma of romeo and his juliet at the climax of exit music is so incredibly impassioned that it ripples my flesh paranoid androids irregular rhythm explodes away into such harmonious beauty for the middle section of that song that it feels as though the powers that govern our world will one day fall at the mercy of art and truth electioneering rocks so hard that i feel as though i could drive my car through a wall and come out unscathed all of these little moments and more of triumph of undeniable beauty and truth have revealed themselves to me over the course of my life a life no better or no worse than anybodys as confusing as meaningless and as profound as the next mans ok computer is my album i was too young to claim ownership of nevermind more so than any other record this album belonged to me it grew with me as i grew with it it was a constant source of comfort and discovery for me and continues to give me strength to this day so why were we listening to this fucking depressing music whilst we broke up why did this album soundtrack the end of my first love the first taste of the bitter disappointment that life and love can bring because nothing else could have done nothing else was as omnipresent nor as conciliatory nor as understanding to a man who was already besotted with music this was an inevitable ever present that would get him through the next few weeks and months nothing ever remains the same and that can be said of ok computer but like a mother it has always remained sturdy and unconditional in its relationship with me it has revealed new secrets as i have grown but it has never let me down and it will never leave me,5.00,4144
ok computer is the best album of the 90s the highest ranked on rym you might say that radiohead fans are a bunch of insistent nerds which we are fair enough but there is got to be more to it the magical decade that started with the grunge explosion and the independent music opening to the world that later welcomed noise rock and britpop that still produces nostalgia even in some people who were barely born at the time all of that was knocked down demolished finished with ok computer slowly but steadily it became undeniable than this level of sophisticated but accessible space rock made everything else pretty much obsolete it was a flood radioheads hype is still alive because of this kid a made them what they are but nobody would have given a damn or bothered to figure out their experiments if they had not left us openmouthed earlier indeed there would not be any need of kid a all the surprise the scratching heads none of that would have mattered at all they had to change because they knew there was no way they could duplicate this it was either that or becoming a rock puppet ok computer is their last epic album here they still have the energy the ambition the confidence the rush to prove themselves of pablo honey and the bends thom yorke sings idiot slow down because they had not stopped yet everything was going forwards as fast as they could in fact they were going so fast it seemed the decade went by faster for them than the rest of us they brilliantly improved their ability to intertwine three guitars on the bends and established the possibilities of filling the sound with more and more guitar here they take it yet to another level and start messing with more stuff and electronic toys the famous radioheads layers at its best it reaches ethereal levels of sonic landscaping it is the kind of music that makes me say pretentious shit like that i cannot help it still it all has a classic band feeling the material works just as good live as they proved at glastonbury it took various listens for me to figure out what exactly they are playing to make it work ok computer was the first time they stepped away from what they had done before too electioneering is the only track that would fit in their previous stuff it could be another try to separate themselves from the creep status if it was i would celebrate that annoying song sincerely they finally succeeded and went from a copycat band to one that generates an awful lot of them lucky enough the same ones that did this game changing album made another one shortly after and it was all over soon enough thanks to that the memory of ok computer is able to stay more or less intact like some kind of summer romance it is aging well who knows if the next generations will keep listening to it as i listened to dark side of the moon i do not really care good or bad it has a well deserved place in pop rock history i have listened to this band more than any other probably even more than pink floyd and back in the day i listened to this album an unhealthy lot is it really that good that is the kind of question i have absolutely no interest in answering,4.00,3139
i do not really know what to say about this it is a classic for a reason i think the band would go onto to do bigger and better things but this is still just a really tight album it is altrock perfection enough said,4.00,215
it probably is as innovative as its fans claim whatever does not make it interesting listening most of the songs are just boring i used to find fitter happier amusing but it just irritates me now consumerism as a subject for serious social commentary is played out and this track brings nothing new or interesting to the table there are a few really good songs though if i believed in measuring albums by averaging how good all the songs are i would rate it higher but having one fantastic song and twelve mediocre songs does not make a good album the good song is good independently but ok computers good songs let down and no surprises are wonderful ballads the lyrics i think are a little disappointing for they eschew timeless universal themes in favour of the overall albums eventuallytobedated commentary on the modern industrial world but then again if i want to listen to poetry i will buy a spokenword album and electioneering is stomping exhilarating bluesy number unlike the ballads the lyrics are very fitting it is an effective piece about the political situation and lends itself much better to universal application but the music is the most important thing and this song shows that radiohead were capable of cutting the whinging and just rocking in short ok computer is not a good album but it does have some very good songs which do justify the albums existence,2.00,1378
i do not really know how to write a review for this one  there is just so much to say and i do not know how to say it ok computer is probably the best album ever made at this point in time it is a cathartic introspective piece of art that culminated from a group of a few dudes jamming out together i do not think radiohead intended to have such an impact as they did whenever i think of radiohead i think of this sound and accomplishment it is essentially a perfect album give or take electioneering which is a good song in its own right and contextually important but an obvious sore thumb out of the 12 songs on this album i can almost definitely say that 10 of them can rank among some of my favorite songs of all time and funny thing  i think i might say kid a is a much more cohesive and consistent record but i just cannot picture myself placing it above ok computer this album is beautiful and i think even the people who somewhat dislike this album can appreciate its importance and influence,5.00,1001
radiohead found lightning in a bottle with the morose and ambivalent ok computer the band has managed to take the alienation of modern city life and condense its massive frustrations into an approachable but musically engaging alt rock album the setup is surprisingly conventional the band is still using the three guitar approach from their last album while expanding their sound with tasteful electronics the guitar work and solos are all around excellent complimenting the albums signature melancholy the interesting points of departure come in radioheads exceptional knack for melodies and thom yorkes largely crooned vocalwork he delivers on the albums signature angst by soaring above and around the bands playing a lot of his vocals drive the emotional core of the project but i think its crowning jewel lies in the lyrics the lyrics are a series of jagged details colliding together into semi coherent laments while this may sound like a complaint i think it is one of the albums best assets the words make sense as pathos for a divided world where people are increasingly isolated from each other and the greatest issues in life are forces far beyond the control of any one person the protagonists of ok computer are incapable of functioning as basic humans and are entirely unable to fix themselves these anxieties are general enough to empathize with an enormous amount of personal issues providing theming general enough to apply to many but specific enough to never lose its weight i think this dynamic is part of why ok computer enjoys such unanimous acclaim while being surprisingly difficult to pin down the arrangements give thom yorkes poetry direction while yorkes lyrics contextualize the musics incredible melodramas they feed in and out of each other perfectly the only hesitation i have with ok computer is its fluff exit music and electioneering do not serve the albums larger conceptual thesis or clash against the central tone respectively these songs could have been cut but i understand that studio politics kept them in the track list they are not enormous blemishes but i would rather listen to them as singles i also understand that some find the presentation to be sterile compared to their later work i can see how this album is tame compared to gut wrenchers like hole in the heart or their followup release kid a but i think that the approachability of alt rock was not only a sincere creative choice but the right one to make in an age where so many have lost control of their fate it makes sense this album would be the 1 album on rym,3.50,2571
ok computer even before reading this review or any other review for that matter it is safe to say you the reader already have an opinion about this album and the band that created it it is also safe to say anything said in this review will do very little to change your opinion of it so you might be wondering why even bother writing about it well simple answer ok computer for me and a lot of other people is an album that has to be talked about not only because it has grown to be one of the most influential rock records of all time but also because it holds quite a special place in my heart cue the awwwwwwwwws in terms of the music there is not a dull moment on this record in its core ok computer is a rock album you have hardy guitar riffs and chord progression scattered throughout the track listing however its ideas are not just limited to the realm of rocknroll there is a fair bit on experimentation here as well there are a lot of unique textures that might escape your ears initially and that can partly be attributed to radioheads ingenious use of subtlety of course there are moments when the traditional rock elements step back and let the strangeness shine for example on subterranean homesick alien you have a tremolopowered organ playing an elusive chord progression with jonny greenwoods effectsridden guitar in the forefront creating a sound which literally brings aliens to mind on paper it sounds like an overkill of effects however those two elements actually achieve an almostperfect harmony and therein lies ok computers greatest strength its ability to meld together ideas that seem like they do not belong together it is traditional yet innovative it breaks rules yet creates new rules altogether it is paranoid about computers yet contains liberal use of electronics and perhaps it is those conflicting ideas that make it an unappealing album to some and the greatest album ever to others,5.00,1919
what can a simple human say about this piece of heaven just bow down and be thankful to be alive after 1997 so you could listen to it,5.00,133
i was not originally going to write a review but considering this is the top ranked album on this whole site right now i figured i might as well put in my two cents on the subject ok computer is decent admittedly my experience listening to radiohead prior to listening to this album was pretty limited outside a few songs while plenty tracks are just soso i genuinely loved a few on here karma police fitter happier and no surprises really stood out to me but they really helped pushed this album to have a higher rating for me i cannot say right now how it compares against radioheads other albums but on it is own it is given me just enough reason to give the rest a shot in short however i cannot say this is the greatest album i have ever heard it is good and definitely worth a listen if at least once,4.00,806
one of those bands where i can certainly recognize and appreciate their brilliance but i do not find myself wanting to visit the emotional spaces they occupy with much frequency,4.00,177
i would not say this album is my 1 favorite of all time and a personal radiohead favorite of mine being the bends but still an album that thank god exists in its time most albums considered the best and i agree are usually from the 60s or 70s but the 90s was still very experimental and innovative on its own terms so for this album from 1997 is an interesting time but the right time for this classic yes classic to be released loveless and nevermind are some of the best to say from the decade but the album ok computer stands entirely alone it just could be the citizen kane of albums really an album too late or way beyond its years it is a cold blissful album but that is what makes it such a breath of fresh air radiohead is one of those bands that everybody listens to and talks about all the time but you maybe one of those things you just really got a hold on like a tv show on a channel you do not have or a superhero movie you just do not care to see but everyone knows ok computer and it is praised and respected for a reason everything is anything more that great it is a true achievement in music why it has great depth and meaning to it without trying too hard it makes me ask myself what the hell is point especially on exit music for a film airbag is easily one of the best openers you could ask for already delivering the albums anxious and lonely theme it is got the popular songs paranoid android and karma police but the songs that are not meant to be singles like let down or electioneering are still some of the best material from the group it also signifys beauty whether it is the great instrumentation on subterranean homesick alien or the space rock on no surprises even if you do not get it or it does not click with you the first time you ever hear this album you still like it and want to listen to it more there is even a lot more of how historically significant this album is to the music frontier but that is for you to find out it is beyond mainstream music yet it gains popularity without losing its foundation everything on here just comes together as one even if it is not the greatest album of all time the question we seek the answer for is what is then this is something we can all agree on for now,4.50,2238
overrated sure still i clearly remember the impact this album made when it was released in fact it was similar to though not as monumental and allencompassing as the similarly and understandably overrated nevermind they were both gamechanging albums that seemed to perfectly voice the disillusion and alienation of the time though this album also seemed to address the increasing prominence of technology even approaching scifi dystiopian future concept album territory at times but forget all that the point is though they did better amnesiac gets my vote for their best album even though i know i am pretty much alone on that and there were slight embellishments and variations this pretty much established the template for all radiohead albums that would follow the schizo multipart paranoid android is still their best song and climbing up the walls karma police lucky and subterranean homesick alien are major highlights as well,4.50,933

written on 71021 ok computer is one of the masterpieces of alternative rock and represents a peak that radiohead never matched rock was not exactly a young genre in 1997 and this album was very effective in blending rock with modernity while still retaining the genres core essence and not reinventing the wheel the individual performances composition songwriting and production are all outstanding and it is just an extremely wellcrafted album in all facets there is a lot of variety climaxes and anticlimaxes and changes in tone throughout all the different tracks and although not every song is a masterpiece they all contribute effectively to the whole let down is the greatest song radiohead ever wrote and it is buildups and emotional impact resonates with me every time i listen ok computers scope and ambition is part of what set it apart from the music of the time through its balance of progressive tendencies with the postbritpop and grunge altrock style which often rejected that kind of approach i am not one of those people who think that forwardthinking music is inherently superior to backwardlooking music but there is something really special about the way this album seems so much more modern than most of its contemporaries a significant part of its legacy is its cultural relevance lyrically and thematically to a time period that is bringing about some of the most drastic changes to society inhuman history it really does capture the zeitgeist of not only its time but the decades following through concepts like technology sanity alienation and political climate it is obvious to say that this relevance will not be going away any time soon an essential album for the 21st century even though it was released in 1997 9510,4.50,1745
prior to this record radioheads discography was filled to the brim with a lot of the angsty alt rock sound that plagued most music tapping into the new brit pop scene while i somewhat enjoyed pablo honey despite the records unpolished production and juvenile lyricism the bends was an album that pushed this phase that was not only prevalent in their music at the time but through out the entirety of the genre ok computer however is an eloquintely arranged record that has the emotional finesse to establish a truly depressing and melancholy atmosphere particularly through thom yorkes vocal delivery see no surprises and paranoid android as prime examples the use of electronic music also complimented the mood that this album sets which would be further developed on kid a my personal favourite radiohead record the only issue i have with this album is the song karma police while it is not a bad song at all the sonic impact did not have the same weight as the lyrics carried in my opinion the piano is particularly flat sounding in this song and kind of vanillarizes the music as whole which is a disappointment as yorkes voice in this song is at it is strongest despite that this record is almost perfect and while most may have listen to karma police and paranoid android already this is defineltely something worth listening too in it is full about three times over this an experience worth sitting through as many times as you physically can 910,4.00,1454
it is hard to justify writing yet another ok computer review in 2017 when people more articulate than me have already discussed the album to death 2017 seems to be the year of the ok computer thinkpiece and like a proper obedient music enthausiast i have been reading them faithfully apart from the brilliant article from the av club my favorite was the rolling stones interview with the band where the members talked about their circumstances at the time that ok computer was being recorded what interested me was how ok computers themes of technological alienation were used by thom yorke to illustrate his anxiety with being on the road without rest for such a long time and how intentional it was to express those feelings through that device people get up too early to leave houses where they do not want to live to drive to jobs where they do not want to be in one of the most dangerous forms of transport on earth he says with this as a core theme of the album the songs become a lot less mysterious making articles like the radiohead prophesies how ok computer predicted the future even more laughable we can take these songs at face value as a collection of thom yorkes experiences without needing a million thinkpieces to fully understand the implications about the 21st century that this album explores of course the fact that i am sheepishly rejecting a hidden meaning in this way just reveals that i am embarrassed to admit that i did believe in the deeper message of ok computer and heck maybe i still do that is fine though you are free to interpret art however you want it would be pretty boring otherwise and i do think that this album is worth all the hype and obsession and dissection twenty years down the line it has a certain legacy surrounding it i consider it a cornerstone of modern music and man i just think it is a really swell album with a lot of interesting sounds great and essential melodies and subject matter that resonated with a lot of people and still does i feel anxious about modern life too sometimes thom i really do,5.00,2057
i firmly believe that ok computer deserves its place at the top of the best of all time chart it really is that good it is certainly the best album i have heard in my life so far but this records quality is not fully apparent at first listen it cannot really be represented by a single track either no surprises for example is a great song i love it but it does not completely floor me it is not supposed to in fact no surprises is all the better for its subtlety and it gains incredible potency in the context of the album as a whole rather ok computer taken as a whole is so cutting and so powerful that it seems to practically embody the isolation and angst of living in the 21st century there will not another album quite like this it was at the perfect time and place doing something that has not come before and cannot be recreated for these reasons ok computer is profoundly moving to listen to each track hits hard and forces the listener to reflect on their space their lives and their relationships there is despair alienation disgust fear regret and relief captured here all bottled perfectly and presented to you in a 5321 runtime if i have one minor complaint it is with electioneering the issue is not with the quality of the song  it is stellar  but rather with its placement on the record between fitter happier and climbing up the walls it is an odd burst of straightforward guitar rock that seems at odds with the chilling atmosphere of the songs around it i think it would have worked better in the first half of the record but that is just me so yeah ok computer you should listen to it rock albums really do not get better than this,5.00,1653
perfect album it is radioheads masterpiece a truly timeless psychedelic futuristic sparkling nocturnal melancholic extraterrestrial album one of the greatest albums of all time,5.00,176
jesus christ shut up about this god damn album please over and over i am told that this is the purest articulation of the ennui of postmodern society on a par with the likes of seargeant peppers and unknown pleasures in terms of cultural impact and artistry the altrock bible they tell me i feel like buster keaton in the wind trying to brave the sheer amount of hype this album seems to generate is it a crime that i think this album is ok but just that nothing about this album gets me particularly excited i do not think it does anything interesting in terms of songstructure i think the things that it has to say about society and consumer culture are selfevident and have aged like milk in the same way that fight club aged like milk fitter happier is embarrasing these days my god so thom yorke and co read some william gibson and some fredric jameson they were not the first in the music industry to do so i do think it is a competent indierock album but being competent should not be something you praise i could use another word bland ok computer is bland it has one or two songs i do enjoy but for the most part everything fades into a kind of vague guitar mush and my eyes glaze over and i am reminded of the songs i used to play on my guitar when i was younger because they were songs you learnt i hate that this has become the standard when people tell me this is their favorite album i always think great job you have fulfilled the requirement to have an interest in music now could you give me a spicier opinion please or are you just going to regurgitate classic albums at me all night i do not articulate this i usually tell them to listen to modest mouses two first albums and then slowdive and some other suitably harrowing shit depending on what type of person they are and then go about my way there is no reason for this to get so much praise for god sakes this is the bends 2 i am docking it half a star because this is the album that persuaded pavement to let nigel godrich do mixing on their last album,2.50,2027
good album a little however sags in the second part,4.00,51
amazingly i did not like this album when i first heard it i was heavily into hiphop and i could not get my head around it at all once i did radiohead became my favourite band what can i say about this thing i cannot find fault with it as hard as i try paranoid android is just an incredible unique song my favourite though is karma police oh my gosh what an amazing tune thom yorks voice is magical on every track the playing is just incredible there is a feeling of melancholy that permeates this album but i do not get sad when i listen to it i find that it uplifts my spirits as all great music does i also really love exit music for a film i get chills when i listen to it i think that yorkes vocals are the best thing about this album nobody sounds like him it is just an amazing artistic achievement,4.50,805
ok computer was them saying ok computer we will use you in the prosess of making all our music now,5.00,98
overall very emotional and an ever so slightly endearing feeling in this whole album but as well as a feel of longing and remorse throughout listening to this i always think of this album like going to your favorite restaurant and ordering an ok meal the restaurant could be a 5 star joint but you could order a 3 star meal if you feel what i am getting at do not get me wrong it is an amazing album i just feel it is just motioning at one specific melancholy vibe but i definitely dig this album i first heard this album and really got into radiohead when i was around 1415 was depressed suicidal etc radiohead gave a kind of a crutch to lean on and say hey yeah this is how i am feeling i am really digging this tone i want to keep listening to this and not kill myself i would not really say radiohead saved my life but i give it props on the emotional effect it has on people 4 out of 5 love this album,4.00,906
ok computer since i joined this site this album is on the 1 spot of our dear charts and i am one of those people who questions this high placement but let me explain i see many strenghts in this album thom yorkes great voice singing these melancholic songs with multilayered diverse instrumentation which creates this gripping atmosphere the songs are mostly memorable intense and everevolving pieces of fine and soft alternative rock and as a huge manson fan i dig those industrial parts fitter happier but despite all these great things i do not think this deserves to be called the greatest album of alltime by any definition first of all it all fells losely connected and sometimes kind of messy or bloated even within songs the constant changes can feel unnecessary or random which putted me off sometimes so while these songs are definetely gripping they also pass by quickly without leaving a huge mark due to the sometimes confusing nature of them secondly while this album is constantly great it also features weaker songs electioneering climbing up the walls that are not nearly as great as the huge highlights paranoid android karma police no suprises and thirdly and most importantly i do not see much value in these songs besides mostly great background music do not understand me wrong it is an art itself to create awesome background music but this is far from my first choice when i want to listen to music without paying much attention and as an artsy album it lacks subtlety direction and a climax or something like that i mean it ends so unceremoniously in my eyes the concept just falls flat so yeah as i see it ok computer is overrated as hell but i see greatness in this album but the greatest album no definetely not for me this is just great and ambitious alternative art rock 4 stars,4.00,1808
the most overrated record of the 90s is nonetheless a great one while there is almost nothing revolutionary in neither sound nor playing style ok computer shines in that it sums up all the things that are significant about rock music and compresses them into eleven melodic short songs which capture the paranoia and distress of the times so successfully that it is no wonder that it is become so popular,4.00,404
i cannot really find faults in this album after about 5000 listens in almost a decade i really did not give it enough chances in the beginning but i always had a good opinion of it 4 stars great but not essential for the longest time the bends was my favorite radiohead album because i could follow it on guitar and sounded achievable or whatever black star high and dry iron lung the bends were all songs i liked before falling in love with this album then kid a caught on with me like a storm because i think kid a as a whole is more rewarding to sit through in it is entirety than ok computer i cannot imagine listening to morning bell without listening to idioteque first the tracks on kid a just sort of bleed into each other and that makes that album more rewarding however i could pick any song from ok computer and listen to it at any time they all work out of context like singles murmur and hatful of hollow have always been essential albums to me the guitars here have that same magic to them we also have the electronic stuff on top of that that pushes that same familiar sound to a completely different level if that was not enough already we have thom yorkes vocals which are very different from the bends and pretty much any other popular band from the time i think well written lyrics can add a lot to an album but vocal melodies are more essential in the long run when you will eventually get tired of the lyrics i cannot really pick a favorite song but electioneering is a song i skip more than others when i am in the mood for music let down really connects with me emotionally without resorting to sappy cliches and that is quite a feat if you ask me when let down picks things up in the latter half it turns into pure bliss in audio form the i am going to grow wings part just overloads my senses every time live versions from years gone by are even better than the studio version in my opinion heck i think most songs here have at least one live performance which are superior to them as much as i love no surprises here nothing beats a 2000s live rendition of the song for me i will not talk about the two big songs from the album instead i think lucky and the tourist need to be mentioned more often i love how the album winds down after electioneering the mellower quieter passages take over the last two tracks may sound out of place to someone looking for the kind of hooks that the singles have but they are ultimately rewarding if you give them a chance highlights  let down paranoid android karma police climbing up the walls airbag lucky,5.00,2568
the best album in the world so much going on but it never sounds cluttered or busy every track is mind blowing in its own unique way this is the album all artists should aspire to make within their genre,5.00,203
have you ever noticed how this band always release their albums in really good years for music maybe they liked the challenge anyway this is a review i have tried many times to write but not many of them have been anything other than drafts i do not feel as strongly about this album any more so i am hoping that reviewing it will be easier this time first of all radiohead is an overrated band because of how consistently their albums are good or better  all of their music except perhaps for the king of limbs is at quite a high standard and thus people revere them in my opinion as someone who is not especially partial to in rainbows or the bends and someone who is bound to be disagreed with the problem is that only a couple of their albums are downright brilliant like everyone seems to think  ok computer is just barely one of them among their best records and a record that contains four of their best songs subterranean homesick alien is probably up there in their top three  i would also include house of cards and morning bell  what can i say philip selway is my favourite member of the band  throughout the second half of the bands discography he has delivered some of the best percussion of the 2000s house of cards features the prettiest drumming i have heard since ringo on in my life that said it is only recently that i have come around to his work here admittedly he would reach his peak on kid a but i am still a sucker for some of his work on ok computer subterranean homesick alien being no exception  it is not the most unique bit of percussion in the world but the weird revolving feeling it has is really a clever feat of production thom yorkes vocals are beautiful here as are his lyrics i wish that they would swoop down in a country lanelate at night when i am drivingtake me on board their beautiful shipshow me the world as i would love to see iti would tell all my friendsbut they would never believe methey would think that i would finally lost it completely  the way he sings lost it completely is more telling than the line itself let down is one of the most heartbreaking songs i can think of its riff despite not being the most technically proficient guitar work on the album is absolutely beautiful but the song mainly exists for its vocals which get sublime in the last third of the song wherein yorke throws some falsetto over the top of the aesthetic the song had maintained until that moment lyrically it is devastating as the title would suggest the emptiest of feelingsdisappointed people clinging on to bottles one day i am going to grow wingsa chemical reactionhysterical and useless no surprises is also quite the heartbreaker  it is home to the albums best bassline and a great melody its best moment is the intensity of yorkes singing such a pretty house and such a pretty garden the tourist is an underrated track which to me captures the split second between a car accident having happened and you realizing it is happened as such it is a rather dreamy song but with an edge of the panic that one feels as something bad is inevitably happening soon the fills selway does are brilliant the song is also home to the most conventional guitar tones on the album which would fit well in the discography of an early 70s hard rock singles band do not get me wrong though greenwoods guitarwork is great probably at its best on the album on the other hand though my favourite thing about this record is how clever and well thought out all the tones of all the instruments are here it is not an experimental rock album but the band really took things into their own hands as far as the sounds of the guitars and keyboards which are varied unpredictable and key to the identity of each song the production is brilliant in other respects too like the occasional creepy additions of background noise that you will hear in fitter happier and exit music for a film the thing about using unusual tones is that it is bound to be divisive in the case of ok computer most people seem to have fallen head over heels with the sound palette but i find that half the time the guitars come off as sounding slightly bland even though the songwriting and playing is always great put it this way it is a hard album to deny the brilliance of i would go as far as saying that no album has captured the inherent coldness and isolation of the modern world nearly as well as this one it even does the job better than radioheads followup kid a an album i prefer but i still fill comfortable deferring to limedibagels calling this album the best of 1997 is accurate although modest mouses offering that year is a definite contender calling this album the best of the 90s is perfectly reasonable calling this album the best of all time is embarrassing scrolling up and downi am born again,3.00,4803
this is the number one album on the website i thought it changed my life in middle school when i first heard it but all the same it is a little disappointing it is number one disappointment and pride mixed up together shame joy i will have each song reviewed after this but first i want to talk about the album as a whole maybe i grew out of it or listened to it too many times but it does not hit as hard as it used to i think it is because to have this as your favorite album you have to take yourself incredibly seriously to listen to this work which is objectively awesome is good but music has a personal element and i feel like the fact that it is number one is sad because personally applying this to your life and missing it as a story and character piece is like looking at a pollock and saying wow i like this painting sometimes when i am mad i throw things at walls i have read the ok computer reviews people are so rabidly invested they are ruining it we need to have a communal consensus that this album is about thom yorke and robots and quit sullying it by putting things on it and placing it on a pedestal everybodys taking themselves way too seriously it is like listening to whale songs and assuming they are trying to speak to you richard summers from conneticut it is a whale or like how every alien in movies looks humanoid radiohead distances itself from us with active contempt why cannot we do the same out of love 1 airbag the only usage of sleighbells i have liked in a song made past 1955 it is not my favorite song on the album but it does a great job of establishing the mood and concept without betraying the emotional buildup that occurs later it is fairly static though the only changed happening subtly in the background in a way that is well calculated and clean  4 stars 2 paranoid android i really love the transition in the beginning of this song opening lyrics included it finds a way of making words that would be hilariously dramatic to read in a teenagers notebook taken seriously by combining them with just the right amount of minutely cerebral details to the lyrics it also finds a way to build the mood up while actually building it down and then immediately follows that with a build down that builds down  4 stars 3 subterranean homesick alien i love the guitars on this song so much i cannot stand it however the lyrics are so relatable to teenagers that it kills me a little i feel like it is a great character song though i mean when i was in middle school i went around thinking that i could show people the stars and the meaning of life and they would shove me away but that was really missing the beauty that is the perspective of the song  4 stars 4 exit music for a film this would make pretty good exit music it would be losing its integrity and irony of self awareness if it were though this is also one of the only times when i have liked that choirlike effect in the back radiohead is just so sincere and deliberate about being insincere and cold that i have to enjoy these sorts of things plus the peak of this song is brilliant and you can tell it knows  4 stars 5 let down this song is half optimistic in a suburban sort of way i like how this song seems to take itself a little less seriously than the others or maybe that is just the character again  4 stars 6 karma police this was my favorite song for years it sounds fascist but good fascist i do not think i can review it without being biased towards my early pubescent self  5 stars 7 fitter happier this is one of those songs that could be a poem too but it is a better song anyways on the first few listens it hit super deep emotionally it is one of those things that people who hate mundane things love because let us face it a good portion of it is just listing what people think about growing up if they do not want to so it has a very specific audience but i fit that audience back when this album was my thing  4 stars 8 electioneering this song rocks a bit harder than the others less cerebral and more quick it is more electric i guess that does not mean it does not fit into the story it does it just also applies outside the story in a more than personal way so realistically he is a bit angry  5 stars 9 climbing up the walls i like how the drum beat and the vocals do not match at all and that seems to make them fit perfectly plus the production including the statics and birdlike effects really make the song it is steady but distant  5 stars 10 no surprises this song is a mix of cute and sad two things that should never normally mix but it works i like to think that it could be exit music too but to a different sort of film you can hear them referencing the mundane again playing to their target emotional sphere but in character when it is second person which is good  4 stars 11 lucky lucky has more of an established chorus and growth than some others on the album they are good no doubt but minimal is radioheads thing and i feel like basing a song in one swooping message does not suit them as well as the songs made out of a bunch of small details  4 stars 12 the tourist this song has a bunch of neat double meanings but i personally do not find it as enjoyable as some others where tension was higher it is slow but without the fizzyness or depth of emotion it is emotional it is radiohead but it holds cerebral a little too high in balance this serves its purpose of a closer but not so much as an independent song  4 stars,4.50,5471
the first time i checked out rym was in 2007 and the reason i kept coming back at first was entirely because ok computer was one of the top albums so i assumed the people on this site have great taste and rym has been my goto for learning about new music ever since,5.00,265
my first encounter with radiohead was sometime when i was taking my first baby steps into the world of music new to the exciting spotify program and constantly browsing around for new good songs to listen to i came across creep which seems to be their most wellknown song for some incredibly odd reason and i also came across karma police which i enjoyed a bit more however at the time i was not a huge fan of radiohead and for years to come i would still find their music to be incredibly overhyped by the general population i still to this day do not find much interesting about the band maybe this is from my days as a hardcore musefan maybe it is from having outgrown brittish altrock by the time i actually started listening to their records or maybe their music just is not for me ok computer exists as the bridging gap between the more accessible mainstream radiohead the one behind the more popular singles creep high and dry and despite being seen as quite ordinary it still adventures a bit beyond the more straightforward rock music of the late 90s with electronic elements peeking in and out hinting of the direction to come on kid a three years into the future something especially notable during the ending segment of airbag or the choir that comes in right in the middle of exit music for a film however despite all these attempts i find it hard to find something to hold onto that is not prevalent in most altrock bands from the same time and place there is something about radioheads music from before kid a that sounds so dumbed down and simplistic where the only thing that really seperates radiohead from your run of the mill late 90s rock band is thom yorkes poetic lyrics a handshake of carbon monoxide the unnecessary experimentation with tracks like fitter happier and the raw emotion that seeps through on a couple of tracks here and there namely let down and no surprises on this record it took me years to go from not being a fan at all to being able to atleast somewhat appreciate ok computer on a personal level and i doubt i will ever be able to love it or radiohead as much as some people think they deserve for me radiohead is the band that will be our generations pink floyd the modern kind of dadrock albums that kids will come across through parents who never ventured outside of the swamps of nmes favorite bands but honestly do not mind my ridiculously grumpy opinions if you have not already heard this album there is a great chance that you might love every second of it and it is honestly worth the fifty minutes it takes to go from airbag to the tourist so if you find yourself on a long commute to work or traveling somewhere far this summer then bring this one and a pair of earbuds for the journey ok computer radiohead 6510,3.00,2768
sweet but a sweet like licking a sticky layer of soda residue off the kitchen table a thick formless gas hidden in crevices,3.00,123
this is the classic example of an album that has to be liked critically acclaimed as an absolute masterpiece in reality analyzing it from a strictly musical point of view it really marks a few positive steps if we exclude the omnipresent karma police and the dreamy no surprises the rest is a good musical carpet for heavens sake it can serve as a comfortable background music if you are studying or reading but a great album is something else entirely it would have been more coherent perhaps to make a single track and not divide the various songs obtaining the stew effect that is not good for the genre in conclusion an album to show or to have at home only to be able to delude oneself of being a musical connoisseur with refined tastes when in reality it is difficult to listen to it all without going on with the tracks,1.00,826
is ok computer a good album yes i suppose so is it an influentialimportant album i have no doubt it is but it is not the greatest album ever made and if one more person tries to convince me otherwise i am punching them in the fucking jaw,3.00,237
although i am a big aficionado of this album i must admit that it is a little bit overestimated apart from paranoid android which is the greatest radioheads achievement ever most of the songs are good airbag subterranean homesick alien exit music let down karma police no surprises lucky fitter happier in fact is not a song but it blends perfectly with the concept of this record it is an outstanding interlude the rest three songs electioneering climbing up the walls the tourist are good filler stuff calling this album the greatest of all time is definitely an exaggeration a radiohead album better that all the beatles the stones the pink floyds and so on albums come on let us get serious the ones that claim that ok computer is the best album of all time act like high school kids when you are 16 and you listen to something interesting you think that you have listened to the best thing ever composed a very good album nothing more nothing less,4.00,952
and we come to the peak ok computer the one that tests your music taste overall i do not think i have seen so much praise and acclaim in the aesthetic albums even in its opening day since sgt peppers lonely hearts club band andor dark side of the moon regardless radiohead are one of my frontrunners while i do not think ok computer is perfect it is still pretty damn good i might as well get through what i disfavour this is one of the first albums i have heard in my life and with all the hype i was not disappointed but i expected a little more most of the album is while grand their melodies are mellow but the first few songs trick you into believing there is some strident electioneering one of the other latter sorted in with the mellow music is one of the nadir tracks excluding the speech synthesis on fitter happier but the composing still feels sturdy and very metaphorical while debatably progressive if they went that farther they would probably be in the same position as muse another is thom yorkes vocals i mentally hearing booing from a crowd but let me first acknowledgement is original the falsetto singing he produces has a lot of depth what is thaaaaatttt what is thaaaaatt while giving a boy band pop voice vibe can appeal to everyone but continuing to hear it in an entirety album loses momentum and psyche maybe intentional since it is so estranged but as debasing as some extents the vocals are lyrically this is the most cognitive material used of mental health since pink floyd also the more homogenous they are together how they both provide hidden symbolism on background instruments that mix in well with the authentic and mechanical pieces my favourite essence is the buildup in the background vocals used in the second versus of exit music for a film and lucky as well as using their art for escapism but giving the awareness of surrealist depression and anxiety the ideal album for the emotionally fragile this is radioheads first concept album and reassessing the strident tone of the album there was no way in hell that they would revert to their original heavy rock and roll sound and not many famous alternative rock bands in the 90s at the time were deriving that deep musicwise i am not sure why even yorke did not want his work with the band to be classified as art but he must have reconsidered with that said ok computer is intelligently crafted intelligently melodic and a culturally significant work of art for our generation highlights paranoid android exit music for a film,4.50,2519
okay i know there is not much i can say about this album that has not already been said however all of the radiohead is god bullshit aside i do not care how high the rating on this site is this is in my opinion radioheads best record it also happens to be one of my favorite records of all time and i am glad it is not my first review i personally believe that this album has more variety than any other radiohead record i will talk about this track by track airbag kicks the album off on a dark and thoughtprovoking note the slow abrasive guitar strumming continues before it evens out and thom comes in with lyrics about dying in a car crash and then coming back to life the song perfectly balances a dark topic with a beautiful melody paranoid android was a ballsy choice for the first single 6 minute songs with odd structures and no explosive catch chorus are rarely radio hits i said rarely not ever but the song was still popular anyway the song begins as hauntingly as it ends it starts with thom begging for peace and ends with him beautifully singing god loves his children god loves his children how seriously yorke meant this is unclear but it leads into the final heavy guitar riff and end of the song over all it feels more like several songs spliced together subterranean homesick alien is where the instrumentation take the front seat for me the opening chords and guitar work are a testament to the musicianship of jonny greenwood his ideas are so unique that someone could tell me that the guitar was actually a synthesizer and i would buy it at least a little conceptually based on romeo  juliet the song exit music has one of the most explosive moment on the album the first half of the song is played by acoustic guitar with lyrics about romeo and juliet planning to run away together it then explodes just at the boiling point of the story we all hope you choke chilling as fuck i have to say let down is one of my favorite songs not just on the album but ever it is yorkes sharpest songwriting as he talks about distant and well let down he speaks of one day growing wings and being hysterical the instrumentation on this song is dazzling as well if you listen to the layers you can see why it is such a difficult song to perform live and why has seemed to vanish from radioheads live sets the melodic floating guitar chords are give me pure eargasms karma police opens up with a chilled out acoustic riff and piano this continues for the first half of the song as thom sings about annoyance and frustration a short fast drum solo creates a transition into the chorus and thom comes back in with his feathery falsetto vocals and sings about losing himself despite its lack of thom yorkes singing and its strange robotic voice i like fitter happier it is a short track with a nice change of pace it is both funny and creepy electioneering is by far the heaviest track on the album and seems like it would be a fun song to see live johnny greenwood really when in a just fucking rock direction with it he then brings in some some raw buzzing guitar work over the rest of the song the drumming on this song is also catchy a hell props to phil and then there was climbing up the walls this song has an awesome and paranoid chorus thom starts singing about someone is skull opening up and climbing up the walls the vocals are so passionate and the song ends with thom letting lose a headsplitting scream i love the production choice on this song too the raw recording and reverby work is trippy the album takes a quick sharp turn with no surprises the intrumentation resembles a lullaby the lyrics talk about wanting a quite life free of surprises it is so beautiful that it almost brings tear to my eye lucky and the tourist are the perfect pair to close off this masterpiece lucky has yorke taking a deeper tone before his voice rises up and he displays his fantastic vibrato the slow soaring guitar creates a great layer over the chorus the song ends somewhat abruptly and leads into the tourist which closes the album with another masterful vocal performance as thom digs into the higher parts of his range to simply say slow down the melody is slow and has so many nice twists and sharp turns in the tempo in my humble opinion this album is one of the best albums ever made definitely top 10 for me it was the first radiohead album i ever listened to and had a huge impact on my musical taste,5.00,4415
welli certainly think so so much has been said about radioheads seminal effort that saw the band move away from their britpop routes and into the melancholic atmospheric alternative rock that they are famous for that i am not quite sure what more i can add everything about ok computer just works from the instrumentation nigel godrichs mindblowing denselylayered production yorkes vocals the songwriting and thoughtprovoking lyrics that eerily predicted life in the 21st century there is not a single weak track to speak of either the song let down might just be my favorite song off all time if you have not listened to this album already then change that immediately believe me it lives up to the hype of being one of the greatest music statements ever to grace this world,5.00,775

year 2190 ad it was a winters afternoon when it all began i was only 12 years old but i still remember the crash that cold impact i told father admin to slow down but the brakes were frozen it was hopeless i closed my eyes and hoped that when i opened them again i would be alive and luckily i was i am amazed that i survived the next thing i remembered was waking up in the hospital the machines beeping ever so steadily that is when the medication started every child has to start it when they become a teenager yet even though i was physically alive emotionally i felt that from that moment on i would be better off dead months turn to years and my emotional numbness began to become normal i started to fit in with the machines as much as i hated to dropping out did not make matters much better as much as i thought it would summer arrives i am 19 now i decided to sneak up on the roof one night and go stargazing with my little brother fantasizing about other worlds beyond our own he asks if we could play hide and seek in the woods just like old times since our admins were sleeping i agree and we jump off the roof and run into the forest together it seemed like we laughed and ran around the woods that night forever that was the last night i would see my brother again the next day after waking from my sleep i began packing my bags i looked back once more at the place i grew up in and started walking but walking turned to running i stopped at a small coffee shop on my way back something about it seemed welcoming to me almost innocent the soft music relaxing atmosphere pleasant design happiness like a utopia separate from the rest of my cold world i take a sip of coffee and start talking to a young girl there breathtakingly beautiful i was surprised to find a human there her name was belle she was a time traveler from earth and said she could tell i was different she held her hand out to me just from her touch the medication i would been forced to take for half of my life begins to wear off and once it does i begin to feel again i was no longer numb the sunlight warmed my heart again and a simple smile made me smile again too i would become human once more i was free the darkness and bleak memories come back to me but so does the light because maybe that is what makes us different from the machines what makes us human is to be able to feel something whether joyful or sad i would not give it up for anything on earth,4.00,2447
going into this review i was already semifamiliar with ok computer having been a longtime fan of indie music though i am hesitant to use the term indie because it covers such a broad range of music nowadays it was difficult to discuss music without radiohead coming up  and of course ok computer my first listen of ok computer some two or three years left me feeling pretty unimpressed the instrumentation only really held my interest on a handful of tracks and the same goes for the lyrics before i go much further though let me warn you my opinion of this album has not changed all that much the first three tracks on the album  airbag paranoid android and subterranean homesick alien  are songs that fall into a category of music that i call decent enough nothing in those three songs jump out at me the lyrics keep me at a consistent level of disinterest and the instrumentation is just good enough to keep me listening waiting for some sort of crescendo finally that crescendo comes exit music for a film is one of my favorite songs off of ok computer not only is the crescendo a little more than 34 of the way through incredible but the lyrics actually give me goosebumps you can laugh  a spineless laugh  we hope your rules and wisdom choke you  now we are one in everlasting peace allow me to reiterate that i do not think the lyrics in the songs preceding exit music for a film were bad they simply failed to jump out at me this might have to do with the fact that the instrumentation failed to support the lyrics because i will not deny that the verse in the next world war  in a jackknifed juggernaut  i am born again from airbag is bland it just does not sell itself in the song let down is a bit of a letdown after exist music for a film though i suppose it would be a bit repetitive to follow a great crescendo of a song with another intense crescendo of a song still let down falls into that same category as the first three songs on the album decent enough however there is one part of the song that does manage to jump out at me and the lyrics in that section almost manage to give me goosebumps too one day i am going to grow wings  a chemical reaction  hysterical and useless karma police is a catchy song and its lyrics are pretty gripping too my favorite verse is karma police arrest this girl  her hitler hairdo is  making me feel ill  and we have crashed her party in fact it is from the lyrics in karma police that i first began to draw my conclusions about the lyrical themes in the album to me ok computer is a collection of songs aimed at exposing and criticizing the ignorance and ridiculous vanity of much of humanity in 1997 and unfortunately the lyrics are still relevant now in 2014 there are also themes of conformity which might fall under vanity fitter happier is the best example of the themes of conformity found throughout the album as the entire track is just a robotic voice reciting reasons as to whyhow he is fitter and happier though this song borders on being laughable for how overwrought it is with metaphor the lyrics manage to be intense enough that you have to take it seriously it is a powerful track however all of the tracks following fitter happier kind of blur together for me with the only that stands out being no surprises it is a catchy track with a sweet melody and the chorus gets stuck in your head  but those are pretty much the only reasons why it stands out to me unfortunately electioneering climbing up the walls lucky and the tourist are all just decent enough the instrumentation is consistently well executed and the lyrics are undeniably poetic and powerful but they just fail to sell themselves in conclusion i do not believe that a song has to literally sell itself to me with lavishly produced synths fit for the radio or anything but i guess i just expected every aspect of ok computer to be mind blowing after all it has quite the reputation though it might be that reputation that caused my to set my expectations so high and thus caused me to be overall disappointed rating 710 favorite tracks exit music for a film karma police fitter happier and no surprises  florist jenkins,3.50,4154
to sum it up as concisely as possible so as to avoid wasting anyone elses time with yet another ok computer review hey that is pretty good i feel it would be an unnecessary waste of both your time and mine to publish yet another stereotypical review for this album we should all negate prattling on needlessly about an album that has unquestionably had its fair share of tired prattling as well as a healthy amount of deserving praise after all there is already a litany of far more interesting and compelling reviews of this album for you to read many of which were written decades ago many of which summed up an album that was groundbreaking for it is time but cannot seem to outlive its own omnipresent shadow to sum up ok computer the best way i know how it is absolutely not the best album of all time despite what the rym charts may say though to be perfectly fair who the fuck am i or any other person to say what the g r e a t e s t album of all time is i do not think you can objectively proclaim that such an objective point of contention actually exists second point to make this album gets a lot of love but in receiving such a staggering amount of love and adoration it has also likewise received a lot of hate it seems to be one of those albums that has become a victim of being hip to hate on so to speak i have had several discussions with people who hated this album but their only real argument and conviction for hating it was the fact that it is so ridiculously beloved my main point here is that i think that ok computer is unquestionably a very good perhaps even great album though i do not think a perfect one that is still a very good album despite how increasingly popular it has become to not like it third and final point this is not the radiohead album nor is it in my personal opinion the best radiohead album i would give that honor to kid a any day of the week and would make a case that in rainbows is even a better album as a whole to me kid a was the real moment of genius for this group that is the album where all of the ideas that the band introduced and grappled with on this album truly blossomed into something bigger than themselves many of the instruments and new technologies brought into the fold on this album did not see their full potential showcased until kid a that is it i certainly do not want to spend anymore time writing ad nauseam about an album that better minds have already dissected well enough and more pretentious minds have tried to piece together the secret truths of the universe by means of,4.50,2555
thom told me to slow down so i am taking a bath i would say i do not know why i rarely do especially now that i actually have a tub that fits me but i already proved otherwise i am an incredibly patient person with all but two things traffic and myself how timely then that i consult this with its bookending automobiles in my time of peak detachment even with my immense privilege to have a shot of making it where i want to go this static interim gnaws at me what if i get there and i was wrong all along i am living the backup plan right now and it is crushing me leaving rust deposits on my grey matter and strangling my sense of possibility and i am one of the lucky ones the more i think about it the fact that the tourist actually left an impression on me is telling past bringers of catharsis now stick to the she will forming around my head dully confirming the alienation they once warned of now that the crisis is here i have to turn to new sources for escape routes,0.50,977
feels weird to review this i kind of doubt i have anything new to say but i guess i want to talk about this i think paranoid android is a permanent taint on this album it is just not a good song for the most part the first little bit and the last little bit are not bad though every other song on here is pure quality though even the songs i first thought were just album tracks or filler like lucky electioneering or the god of all interludes fitter happier are so much more than that i do not really like that i like this so much mostly because of how easy it is to like radiohead every white boy on earth thinks radiohead is the best even people who is other favourite acts are flume and deadmau5 annoying why cannot this be only ok,4.50,735
his head was a mess full of thoughts full of hopes and dreams he tried to gather every single piece of valuable information from the guy telling him what to do because he was certainly not falling blindly into his trap oh yeah he would fall into his trap but it would certainly not happen without him first taking every possible precaution he felt ready but at the same time completely clueless what was he to expect everyone he had spoken to every author he had ever read every tvshow they all agreed on the fact that this was a great thing but he just could not figure it out not for the life of him it was such a mystery to him how could it be his friends turned his back on him they did not have time for this kind of hesitation just go through with it they said it is definitely worth it he was getting closer he had taken the first step he found himself in a building filled with sound a strange sound a sound he recognized but could not place it his friend was with him he looked at him with half eagerness half disappointment he pointed him in a direction he could not quite understand what his friend was trying to tell him but he followed him here his friend said and handed him a plastic square of confusion is this it he asked his friend and was met with an expression he had seen many times before a look of anger and resignation take it or leave it i am done with this stupid game the friend exit the building he was left on his own he felt hopeless cmon he said to himself it is just a plastic square ffs he was holding it in his hand flipped it over discovered some numbers and words flipped it back again he could not quite understand it but took it with him anyway it was time he came across another human being he was intimidating long hair tattooed forearms kind of muscular but not an athlete he gave him the plastic square the tattooed man looked at it put it down and went through some drawers located behind him he came back with a circle of plastic and then for some reason placed the circle inside the square a circle inside a square what is this suddenly he was at home with the plastic square in hand what to do he entered his room walking past what he thought was his mother and some other people sitting there like mummies staring at him he was in he was safe it was only him and the plastic square then he felt lost again what to do he wandered aimlessly around his room with the plastic square squeezed firmly in his hand his head was filled with questions but no answer was given but suddenly as he was squeezing the plastic square harder and harder he heard a click he was startled but kept it together the square had opened and the plastic circle was revealed it was back what was it he took it out held it in his hand baffled and curious he looked around his room what to do then in the corner he saw the machine the machine his father had bought him for christmas he went over no way he thought but went on to push the obvious button the button who was staring at him out came a tray he was again startled but kept his composure he looked at the tray formed with a circle around a needle or laser of some kind he thought twice but finally took the plastic circle and placed it on the tray it fit he gave it a little push and it went back inside the machine was it lost did he complete the task he stood there for a while did not quite understand and was about to leave the room then the machine started to play what is this he stared at the machine in amazement the sounds got clearer he was mesmerized he could not move he locked the door threw himself on the bed and stared out the window on the world outside still kisses with saliva the machine said he smiled even thought people had knocked on the door yelled at him trying to make contact he did not respond he did not leave his room that day and people have said that the guy who came out was not the same guy going in no one could quite understand but he was no longer the same person something had happened something had completely altered the turn of the tide who was he was he the friend was he the son was he the brother the customer the classmate the odd looking fellow no he was no longer any of those things he had become the tourist,5.00,4235

further implementation of studio tech would finally reveal radioheads musical potential ok computer is pretty much a concept album for the distraught condition of trying to be human in an era where technology is increasingly more prevalent and necessary for us to feel important the psychedelic overture of airbag implements delicatelyplaced jinglebells chiming in the backdrop as well as the synth cello harmonizing the main riff then the disorienting swaths of digital turntablism just adds to the atmosphere of a world helplessly computerized and technological the hit of the album paranoid android demonstrates a haunting performance from yorke slurring infantile moans in the verses and a hook of him crooning a melodic and worrisome cry of fear what is this what is that the track also features some of jonnys most interesting guitarwork going from mellow gilmouresque rock to hard and distorted grunge subterranean homesick alien slows down the momentum a bit but exceeds at maintaining the albums cosmic sound and pale despairing mood jonny contributes some reverberating slides and twinkling licks that float and collapse into mesmerizing mayhem exit music surprises with an upfront and personal acoustic accompaniment a chamberpop ditty supplied with a ghostly bloodless backup choir and the tinny sample of a squeaking railway to effectively create an atmosphere of urban anxiety similar to what pere ubu did in the modern dance let down alleviates the depression a glittery riff from jonny and a more uplifting refrain coupled with lyrics about yorkes abstract misery let us the song exist in a state of contradiction  it hints that sadness and pain is expected and even welcomed karma police is the most catchy demonstration of yorkes melodic whimpering a melody very very similar to the beatles martha my dear but this can be excused due to the two songs obviously contrasting tones fitter happier is the albums disturbing interlude with the monologue of a digital voice either a robot or a dehumanized person beyond a soundscape of studio fluff and other assorted audio effects to enhance the horror and disaffected despair electioneering offers hardrock and electric blues reminiscent of blue oyster cult and the powerpop of the bands earlier work it prevails at sustaining excitement climbing up the walls is slow and muffled with distortion ending with a psychotic howl in contrast no surprises features a very pretty melody accompanied with the sweet dings of a glockenspiel after some writhing verses the overwhelming triumph in the hook of lucky suggests a happy ending for ok computer until you hear the albums tragic and comatose closer the tourist a song of slowmoving rhythm bass and guitar stalling with improvisation at the start for yorke to step in and deliver an unexpectedly serene performance lyrics vaguely about moving fast and seeing sparks which i loosely affiliate with the air crash of the previous song then after all this meticulous multilayered production extravagant synth and compositional arrangements emotional performances from yorke on vocals and jonny on guitar how does the album end ok computer concludes with the last playful ding of a triangle who says punk is dead,3.50,3217

i could write a book about this album but i would just be repeating what everyone else has said before me this is probably the best album ever made go listen to it its incredible,5.00,178
probably this is really the most worthy candidate for the title of the best album in history  relatively recently recorded read modernsounding without excessive zaum and capable of sounding on the radio without any compromise able to please both the average listener and the intellectual critic at the same time  it makes no sense at all to talk about the quality of the recording  a crystal clear sound the bands musical flair amazing in its conciseness and scale at the same time as well as yorks lyrics understandable but not easy to perceive immediately to the right extent in any case will attract attention and not will leave you indifferent each time returning to the album i understand that even almost 10 years since i got to know this album i am hardly able to fully appreciate all its depth and power,5.00,811
it is difficult to adequately evaluate this album that is i sincerely consider this album a masterpiece and agree with all the ratings that put ok computer in 1st place but i can listen to this work only in a certain mood perhaps i am not as crazy as thom yorke perhaps it is his vocals but in any case i have 2 fundamentally different assessments of this album complete sucks and brilliant work but i do not want to put the arithmetic average of the album so the rating you see above is rather an objective assessment of the albums quality than my subjective impression,4.50,570
this is the best album of the 1990s 5 stars for the creativity alone,5.00,68
lt 1 one thing i really liked was the clear direction in atmosphere all the way up to track 9 we have the first two tracks making the most of the fact that the direction of the album and the sound on it might not be entirely clear yet before track 3 slows things down to bring context to the anthemic conclusion to the opening act of ok computer that is track 4 now with a clear sound and a good idea of what the atmosphere here is we have tracks 5 through 7 capitalizing on these notions building and sustaining themselves upon the atmosphere of the album track 7 is also a great conclusion to this part leaving the album on a bit of a cliffhanger as to where to go next and track 8 makes fantastic use of this uncertainty to propel ok computer in a completely new direction thus giving us a set up to a darker final act made great use of by track 9 sadly that is where the string is broken on the last three tracks i get the impression that the bigger picture was kind of lost track 10 feels especially out of place a very badly timed cheerful song with little else to show for itself track 11 sounds like it was originally a bside slapped in to salvage the ending as being part of the rest of the album somewhat and track 12 is another jarring change of pace of course one can argue that tracks 10 and 12 are meant to be cathartic in a way to serve as a contrast for the darker previous sounds but if that was the purpose then they were just badly executed as such track 12 is salvaged by the fact that it is a genuinely interesting song but i really cannot say that about track 10 and overall they are way too bubbly and too close together there was also not enough space in between the cliffhanger and track 10 to actually justify such a drastic change of sound a cathartic track should serve as relief after a gruelling journey not as a bump in the road other than that the songwriting is pretty solid throughout more playful at the first two tracks more collected during the rest i am afraid this affects the album negatively on the second half as there is a clear rehashing of ideas with many of the tracks that seems to not accomplish any goal other than taking up space during the first two it is a lot more inventive allowing for some really interesting progressions of ideas but they ultimately seem a bit underdeveloped with a series of unresolved ideas and dead ends especially prevalent on track 2 the production is probably the best part of the whole ordeal creating a dynamic and spacious sound with some very minor blemishes,3.50,2542
i honestly do not understand how this album can rank 1st all years combined this is the worst album from a vastly overrated band the melodies are disgusting the singles are the worst i put a point all the same for lucky and its excellent break,1.00,243
sorry i just did not like it edit goddamn this album does not make things easy it is usually very easy for me to tell the quality of an album in the first three five eight listens not ok computer oh no shit cannot be that simple every musical direction they go in is so subtle most of the songs on this album are the musical equivalent of sneaking an elephant into a conference room how they actually manage to pull it off is beyond me anyway pretty legit album sorry for the harsh criticism,4.50,491

i find myself listening more to radioheads more electronic experimental postok computer output but there is no denying how ridiculously solid okc is as far as guitarbased altrock goes it all sort of exactly achieves its purpose like how opening airbag feels like a welcome to an epic space odyssey paranoid android arguably the albums magnum opus takes bohemian rhapsody a superficial and tired comparison but whatevs into the age of machines alienation and well paranoia subterranean homesick alien might have the most beautiful lyrics of the album up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets  i wish that they would swoop down in a country lane late at night when i am driving take me on board their beautiful ship show me the world as i would love to see it i would tell all my friends but they would never believe me they would think that i would finally lost it completely i would show them the stars and the meaning of life they would shut me away but i would be all right the following exit music for a film is on the other hand my favorite song musically featuring thom yorkes creepily intimate voice and a climax out of this world karma police is a sad ballad drawing inspiration from orwell andor kafka fitter happier one of the songs i relate to the most inhumanly lists the demands on humans not drinking too much regular exercise an empowered and informed member of society while stipulating that we should still cry at a good film though not in public and kiss with saliva after that downer ensues the albums banger the absolutely raging electioneering the tourist is as perfect a closer as airbag was an opener i also think its breezy ambient feel slightly foreshadows the radical transition radiohead did with kid a even if i would never have been able to predict it ex ante,4.50,1919
there are very few bands out there that have confused me as much as the english alternative rockers radiohead this is a band that combined rock music with electronica to forge their own niche within the 90s alternative scene in doing so they have somehow became one of the most celebrated and albeit divisive bands not just on rateyourmusic but in music in general to be perfectly honest i have never quite understood the insane devotion that radiohead and especially ok computer receives i have often felt that the music had somewhat of a shallow and clinical tone although i will not deny that they were an innovative group especially when compared with the majority of other 90s alternative bands while i have warmed to the bands sound considerably in the past year or so but i am still having trouble fathoming the intense love for this album to be frank ok computer is not even my favourite radiohead record and i have always drifted more towards kid a when looking for the best example of the bands creativity you may call it redundant in me reviewing such a widely known and discussed record but i want to finally be able to sum up my opinion of this record once and for all assuming i do not suddenly fall in love with the album some way down the line while this record does feature some electronic arrangements this is still a rock record at heart and it really was not until kid a that these electronic parts became fully realised it is mainly for this reason that i would pick the latter record over this one at the end of the day however i do have to respect radiohead for not being afraid to experiment in order to find their own sound the track airbag kicks off the record this track begins with an oddly harsh distorted guitar riff before launching into a much more subdued passage while i can imagine this transition would potentially come across as a little jarring radiohead actually pull this off in a pretty restrained manner thom yorkes mellow vocals just reach out of the mix but i often feel that he was fighting for room over the guitars overall i do like the atmosphere that this song presents especially with the wailing guitars in the background but personally i feel that the song could have developed more especially in the latter portions of the track when listening i would often find myself checking the time left on the song one of the biggest hits to come from ok computer is the second track paranoid android this track weaves through a multitude of different parts and as a result is one of the most attention grabbing on the entire record while the opening minute feels rather bland the song does start to build in its atmosphere once the chorus arrives with the vocals and the guitar leads in the background really highlighting this atmosphere the song eventually builds into a much heavier section which unlike on airbag is handled in a more well thought out manner this section shows the band playing at the highest gear with yorke yelling over the mix and with the lead guitars adding even more power to the song the penultimate section sees the band going into the incredibly mellow and harrowing tones that they are known for the vocals in this section actually shine through very clearly in this part and the backing vocals add a great deal of despair to the music while i would not call myself a huge fan of paranoid android i will admit that it is one of the better examples of the bands ability to craft unique challenging and extremely melancholic music if i were to pick my favourite track from the record it would have to be the song karma police this is one of the few moments on the record where i feel like i fully get the sound that radiohead are going for this track builds into a groove with a chord sequence that really brings forth the harrowing atmosphere that i feel that the band often go for yorkes vocals feel right at home on this track as he sounds as if he could start crying at any minute my only slight concern with the track is its lyrics this song is one of the strangest songs from a lyrical standpoint that i have heard in a long time the song seems to be discussing the idea of karma coming back to the narrator after they reported two individuals to the karma police but the analogies the narrator uses eg buzzes like a fridge hitler hairdo just sound awkward in my honest opinion overall however this is one of the few tracks on ok computer that i regularly find myself revisiting a couple of other tracks that do stand out to me would be exit music for a film and let down both of these tracks have a similar depressing atmosphere but each song presents it in a considerably different manner the first half of exit music relies on just the acoustic guitar and yorkes vocals which sound especially bleak on this track as if he is simply giving up on life the song let down has much more of a drive to it and has an almost britpop feel to it and as a result i would say the song does at times slip into the generic side of music to a certain extent with this being said however the vocal melody has a tone of finality to it which is one of the things that radiohead do succeed in producing sadly however there are a number of tracks that just do not bring much to the table for me subterranean homesick alien feels particularly unfocused and empty for me the song seemingly meanders throughout without really building into anything particularly effective i would also say that the second half of the record does show a noticeable drop in quality when compared with the first half the first thing we hear from this half is the utterly pointless fitter happier track i can appreciate the self improvement theme of the lyrics but there is nothing appealing about hearing this from stephen hawkings voice box at least not on a record the track climbing up the walls is another slower paced track with another really bland and uninteresting vocal melody while this song does build to a somewhat intense climax it ultimately feels wasted on such a dull melody thankfully the song no surprises does save the second half of the album this track does remind me a little of let down albeit with a more subdued tone the song does have a similar tone of finality in the vocals and when combined with the subtle xylophone and guitar melodies works very well in creating a particularly haunting atmosphere the production on here is for the most part very well done the guitars are particularly bright and i really admire the drum production throughout the record the snare is especially punchy albeit sounding a little out of place on a few of the more mellow tracks as i mentioned earlier the vocals have a tendency to be rather far back in the mix at times as a result it can be somewhat of a challenge discerning what he is singing so in conclusion is ok computer a solid record sure is it deserving of the number one spot on ryms chart well that is ultimately up to you but personally i would have to disagree while the album does boast some fairly innovative bleak and well crafted material a significant portion of the songs just lack a lot of depth or direction a lot of radiohead fans may just say i do not get this and i would agree with them to a point however even after revisiting this record on multiple occasions i still do not see the godly reputation it gets maybe i will come back to the album in ten years time and it will finally click but for now i really cannot give this anything above a 7,3.50,7471
surely there is noone left who loves rock music who has not got this in their record collection on the offchance there is and they are reading this then buy it now sell your clothes your house and your mother if you have to ok computer is a masterpiece it sounded years ahead of its time on its release and still sounds ahead of its time now songs have perfect melody and structure and are produced superbly airbag opens up the album and sets a standard that rarely slips layer on layer of sounds guitars electronic blips and beeps then we have the tour de force of the album in paranoid android its one song but seems to have 3 songs within it it broods along before coming to an explosive climax this is what rock music should be it moves you it speaks to you the thing that always hangs in the back of your mind with this album though is just how unique it sounds this is not four spotty teens in their garage at home thrashing out rock songs these are wonderfully constructed tunes almost oddities in a world that was churning out the same old same old only the strange addition of fitterhappier feels wrong the songs are so lush and so lavish you feel like you could lose yourself in them no surprises is like a childs song played on a xylophone it should be too twee throwaway but it s one of the strongest songs on the album nothing sounds likes this fifteen years on noone has even tried to copy their formula how could they it is like trying to copy cocacola you could try but it would not taste the same buy it lose yourself in it albums like this come along once in a blue moon staggering,5.00,1599
as almost everyone does i have a story related to this album if you would like to skip straight to the album analysis skip down to the dotted lines otherwise enjoy i used to skulk on music forums early on in highschool fairly regularly one album that i could not seem to escape seeing was radioheads ok computer i decided that i needed to buy it and see if all the hype and attention was warranted not long after i made that promise to myself i received word that my uncle had died he did not die in a normal way though he died by falling into a river and drowning he was drunk that day and he had a history of severe alcoholism and drug addiction shortly after his death i accompanied my family to his old apartment to help clean out his belongings the man did not have anyone close to him other than siblings and nephews like me as we were cleaning out his apartment i noticed he had a fairly big music collection i was free to choose what i wanted and take as i see fit it is a weird experience taking from someone elses music collection and adding to your own it feels like you are taking something that meant a lot to someone and making it part of yourself i listen to albums with the possibility in my head that it may perhaps be a transcendent experience that could not only make you see life differently but also to encapsulate you into a world that the artist has so meticulously developed and created ok computer is one of the albums that has shaped me to think this way so by this logic each album is a story or a capsule of force that enriches your life by taking my late uncles albums they metaphorically gained a new life a rebirth if you will by the happenstance of a new owner i did not receive ok computer from my uncles collection though as i headed out with my mom to run a few errands that same day i decided that day was the day i would buy the album i did just that at one store and when we got back in the car i put the cd in immediately let us just say that in 9th grade i was not ready for what this album represented and what it entailed i distinctly remember putting the album back on the shelf after a few nonsuccessive listens but something kept drawing me back to it in 10th grade i returned to it with a determination to see and understand the album because i knew i had to be missing something seemingly it became my sole mission in life to listen to this album after literally 16 listens it finally clicked for me that year i did not fully understand it yet but i felt like i had finally gain the key to the locked door of understanding and so that is how it was for a while i continuously listened to this album throughout the rest of my high school career although not so much my senior year the album actually inspired me and incited ideas for the topic of my junior theme due to this album i wrote a 15 page thesis on the dehumanization of society through modern technology it was an ambitious topic for a kid in 11th grade but i was determined to write a quality paper on this topic in the same way that ok computer gave understanding to me i wanted to give understanding to my teachers and my peers i guess i must have succeeded because not only did i receive the highest marks for the paper in the class but i also won a scholarship with it mission accomplished maybebut maybe not here i am now in my first year of college and i still find myself returning to this album some have called it the dark side of the moon for our generation and others have called it the most important album during the coming of the 21st century others yet said it defined and represented the oncoming digital culture filled with personal phones and social networking i suppose i will cut the personal stories out and get into this album and what it represents to me  the album starts off with the broodingly aggressive and gloomy airbag those screeching and unsettling guitar riffs kick off the trip that is radioheads third album it is a song about a neardeath experience in a car that thom yorke was in as the vehicle crashed seemingly dooming the narrator to silence forever the airbag in the car popped out and saved his life so just as technology was about to be the death of a man another piece of technology saved him this sets up an interesting and important dichotomy that extensively defines the ideas of this album i have heard paranoid android described as the modern bohemian rhapsody and that description does not even do this song justice i have always viewed the song and its multitude of time signature changes as a concept of disillusionment from society and a jaded view of societys reliance on material possessions to find contentment and happiness the progressions and climax of this song root it as one of the greatest songs radiohead has ever put to tape subterranean homesick alien is a small little piece about isolation and cynicism the singer cannot seem to relate to anyone around him on any significant level this cynicism leads him to wishes to be swooped up by aliens so he can see the world from the equivalent distance that he feels emotionally detached from it an unsettling and relateable piece exit music for a film is easily one of the most haunting songs radiohead has recorded i have always viewed it in a particular way judging from its placement on the album i have always thought that it had a lot to do with the previous track although yorke felt detached from society he finally found a girl who was just like him someone he could relate very closely to it turns out that love was not the remedy for their problems in fact they only added to the collective depression together they had come up with a scheme to kill themselves perhaps from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car that is what this song is about to me this girl remains an important plot point as the album progresses let down is easily one of the most beautiful and transcendent pieces radiohead has ever produced the song seems to take place after a time gap from the suicide attempt in the last song we can assume the narrator no longer sees this girl maybe her father found out like yorke thought and their suicide attempt was unsuccessful another interesting theory is that perhaps yorke survived and the girl died if this did happen yorke would likely have to flee from wherever he lived by some sort of transportation and the first few lines of this song here support that theory transport motorways and tramlines starting and then stopping taking off and landing the emptiest of feelings disappointed people clinging on to bottles and when it comes it is so so disappointing either way let down has always seemed to me to be about nihilism depression and absolute detachment from society the narrator watches people carry on with their everyday lives and he just does not get it what is the point the narrator thinks that relationships emotion and life as we know it is futile because it all fades into nothingness by the end do not get sentimental it always ends up drivel his feelings from this song has led him to some sort of superiority complex when looking at others this leads to a developed sense of prejudice arrogance and condescension in his mind and this is expanded upon in the next song karma police is rightfully one of radioheads most popular tunes the haunting piano intro sets the foundation for a song about judging others and finally coming to the realization that you are no better than them by the ethereal climax of the song the narrator realizes that this anomaly has been sorted out for his own good and he feels a renewed sense of self by distancing his prejudice phew for a minute there i lost myself i lost myself fitter happier is one of the most interesting cuts from the album and it is fairly simple there is a computer voice that speaks slogans and capitalist motifs for a happy life it is got everything in there from holding down a job sleeping well having a wife driving a nice car eating healthy exercising and just generally being productive this is could easily be looked at as the albums thematic centerpiece as the album is about dehumanization and capitalist culture this song represents someone who tries his best to act according to how the experts think you should act to have a good life despite his best efforts though he still feels powerless and empty and he realizes that this way of living does nothing but strip all this is human right form your soul calm fitter healthier and more productive a pig in a cage on antibiotics electioneering is probably the most straightforward song on here as it is just an energetic rocker on the surface beneath the surface though it is a critique and jab at politicians and various sociopolitical affairs this song suggests that politicians are only out for power and their own gain they do not care about the society at large so far on this record our narrator has become disillusioned and disconnected from religion love society technology drugs culture and now politics as well so after all that disconnect what is left for our narrator enter climbing up the walls one of the eeriest pieces radiohead has ever made through distortion reverb and great production radiohead create a song that not only gets in your head but also is about things going wrong in your head this song is about the suffering and depression associated with someone who has nothing left to lose this songs about someone whose mind and views on things are quickly deteriorating and the person losing hope how can our narrator possibly find a way out of his precarious situation the conclusion comes in no surprises the glockenspiels that coat the song add a sense of irony to the whole affair the song is about suicide and this time carbon monoxide is cited specifically in my interpretation this would be yorkes second attempt in the album at suicide although suicide is a hefty topic this song presents it as something more tranquil and peaceful our narrator has realized that the american dream if you will is not meant for him he realizes that all of these things that society says you need to have are nothing more than control tools used by the government and other corporations to keep making money and maintaining control of the population a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal you look so tiredunhappy bring down the government they do not they do not speak for us i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxide lucky is one of the slower and more mesmerizing tracks on the album thematically it is very similar to airbag and it happens to be about surviving a plane crash fittingly enough i have come up with a theory about it i think this song is linked closely to no surprises bear with me here if you watch the video for said song you see thom yorke with some type of mask the mask fills up with water and thom looks like he is about to die from suffocation when it empties i believe the thoughts going on in no surprises are actually happening inside our narrators head while the plane crash described in lucky happens take a look at these lyrics kill me sarah kill me again with love it is going to be a glorious day pull me out of the aircrash pull me out of the lake because i am your superhero we are standing on the edge from what i can interpret perhaps sarah was the girl our narrator was enamored with in exit music she is likely the one who died in their suicide attempt from these lyrics one can gather that her death still troubles our narrator immensely and he likely feels responsible for her death the second set of lines that include superhero are likely not the words of our narrator but rather the words of sarah that are still echoing in his head sarah wants our narrator to save her the bring forth some sort of redemption sarahs death has caused her to be viewed as a sort of hero in the narrators eyes due to the words of sarah echoing in the narrators head he cannot go through with the suicide that was talked about and planned in no surprises he feels like he is on the edge of a turning point in his life but he is not sure what yet sarah is with him and together they will find an inevitable conclusion to their collective suffering the tourist marks the end of this album and the completion of our cycle of understanding let us take a look at the lyrics and i will try to wrap this up as well as i can it barks at no one else but me like it is seen a ghost i guess it is seen the sparks aflowin no one else would know hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down sometimes i get overcharged that is when you see sparks they ask me where the hell i am going at a 1000 feet per second hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down sarahs voice is now an imminent part of the narrators brain almost like a second conscience the voice of sarah is guiding him inside of his head almost like a ghost that is barking things at him constantly he is going crazy and his driving reflects this in this song he is in his car driving 1000 feet per second let us look at these two lines i guess it is seen the sparks aflowin no one else would know these lines are about sarah or at least her conscience that lives inside the narrator sarah is the only one who knows what the narrator is going through and she is seen his problems sparks aflowin the line no one else would know implies that sarah is the only person the narrator has gotten close enough to who would know about his tumultuous innertensions then we have got the final and very important line hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down now if you have not made the connection yet i will tell you this song is the precedent to the opening track airbag that leads us to a couple different conclusions and i will put each one that i have thought about out there for you 1 those last lines are uttered by sarah in the narrators head she is trying to pull him to reason soon after the narrator gets into a car accident and that is when the airbag saves him using some of the lines from that song you can more fully see the end of the cycle in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe in a deep deep sleep of the innocent i am born again remember the lines in lucky about the superhero well perhaps the neardeath experience has given the narrator a renewed appreciation for his life he realizes that he is a victim of society at large the narrator is a bornagain appreciator of life not unlike a bornagain religious person sarah has manifested herself into the narrators mind and the narrator realizes what he must do he needs to save society bring them to the same understanding that he has he needs to make them see what what he and sarah have seen thus the loopcycle of the album begins starting with the schizophrenic heroics of paranoid android 2 maybe the voice that the narrator heard was not actually sarah at all maybe it was actually the voice of a demon or some interdimensional being that imitated sarah to get the narrator to do what the being wanted now what could the being have possibly wanted to gain by imitating sarah by manipulating the narrator into neardeath experiences the narrators appreciation of life is renewed before the narrator does anything drastic maybe the reason that the narrator cannot do anything about his situation is because he himself is being controlled by forces around him although we realize that the narrator has disconnected from almost everything he cannot transcend into anything greater than an average person until he leaves all human things behind by the end of the album we realize that there was one thing that the narrator could not leave behind and that was sarah sarah herself is a metaphor for human connection emotion and understanding 3 the third explanation is the most farfetched in my eyes but it is still worth talking about maybe our narrator exists in the world but to him it is not the world we see it is actually his own personal purgatory or hell if you will with this in mind it makes sense to assume that the suffering of his purgatory will never end no matter how hard he tries and fights for it to end every time he tries to escape the purgatory manipulates him and prevents his actions although the narrator has reached somewhat of a higher level of understanding he is doomed to stay in the same world as everyone else and watch them die or mundanely carry on doing things that do not matter sarah then is a metaphor and an important plot device for the album sarah represents the thing that our society is destroying and degrading beauty the beauty that is present in all things that we reach sooner to destroy emotion love connections sympathy empathy the human condition all of it is being destroyed and our narrator cannot stand to watch it all go conclusion if you are still reading this i thank you for having the patience to read my theories about this record if it was not obvious this album is very special to me i never get sick of the guitars the pianos the synths the organs the glockenspiels the percussion the smooth and rhythmic bass or the angelic voice of yorke many props go to nigel godrich who made this album sound like it did modern day dark side of the moon maybe but only time will tell that this album has many themes important to society today the album should be taken as a lesson and a cautionary tale there is not much like kicking back and absorbing yourself in the malicious and noncaring world of ok computer and every time you listen to ityou cannot help but relate very deeply to it best tracks paranoid android let down karma police no surprises lucky 9810,5.00,17653
ok computer impacted me when i was a teenager but not so much for its songs but for its sound which is very well done nigel godrich you are a fucking genius futuristic atmospheric space pop the guitars really sound great it is difficult to find another album in aesthetic similar to this it is clearly a step forward from his previous work the bends airbag is a great start paranoid android is an excellent suite perhaps the bands most complex song subterranean homesick alien works very well and is quite atmospheric let down is simply masterful karma police despite being played quite a bit on the i still find radio magnificent no surprises is masterful one of my all time favorite songs lucky conveys an unusual form of quite emotional despair and i find the tourist to be a more than remarkable closure with slowcore influences clearly yorke and co they were listening to low now the negative there are weak songs on the album and some that i would consider only acceptable exit music for a film is somewhat boring too melodramatic it does not fit the album the final stretch is so bloated and epic i did not like it a lot at 15 and now less where are those wonderful light and atmospheric guitars electioneering is another track that does not fit and to be honest it is not that good climbing up the walls is heavy and long the chorus does not even have a shine the production is a bit over the top and there is too much melodrama again in summary ok computer even being an album with several not so good moments it has pinnacles that are really memorable so i can understand its status as a key album of the 90s without a doubt one of the albums with the best singles of the decade pity that as a whole it is somewhat inconsistent 8710,4.00,1742
one of the best albums in the history of music dixi,5.00,51
the first radiohead album i ever listened to and my favorite album to date for me this album is a journey through different sensations from the melancholy of exit music for a film to the sounds of rock guitars in electioneering a very complete album the best of radiohead and the best album of the 90s i like all the songs on the album since they all have a special touch including the scary fitter happier with its robotic voice its weird background sounds and those great lyrics favorite songs paranoid android lucky tourist electioneering subterranean homesick alien,5.00,569
we hope that you choke the big phrase that to many was the most memorable lyric on radioheads third lp ok computer when i saw this lyric for the first time it was well before i had listened to the album on a banner advertising itself by the time i was ready to listen i had imagined a thundering roar of we hope that you choke to end the album as an emotional finisher to end all finishers instead i heard a whimpering sniveling vergeoftears lyric over and over again at the end of exit music for a film somehow the phrases wimpy sound gives it more of an emotional boost than any amount of screaming could have such is the case with ok computer the sound does not have the emotional instability and purity of many other classic albums like it instead it wedges itself into the history of rock with a sound all its own detached reserved and genuinely depressed this perfectly matches with the monotonous subject matter the production is spotless and crisp keeping the music in perfect condition and bringing out instruments that would create the greatest sound possible in short ok computer is an absolute and complete masterpiece of sonic experimentation unlike any other at the time an lp that could only have been made by radiohead,4.50,1234
i must admit the first time i listened to radioheads ok computer i was not impressed i guess i expected something else something more alike creep but after a week or two i realized i would been thinking of it unconsciously and i felt a need to listen to it as i have never felt to listen anything else i love music and i have listened to every kind of music there is since i was a young boy i love pink floyd the beatles and led zeppelin but i would never felt this way before since that day listening to ok computer gives me goosebumps and i can truly say it is one of the best albums ever from the opening in airbag everything is just perfect the amazing suite paranoid android the surrealism on subterranean homesick alien the beauty of exit music for a film the delays in let down those amazing 8 notes in karma police when you listen to it you will know what i am talking about fitter happiers amazing lyrics and piano melody craziness inelectioneering the dark climbing up the walls and the amazing threesong set that closes the album sweet no surprises although lyrics are not so sweet pink floydesque lucky and mindblowing the tourist that urges you to slow down after all the albums given to you just simply perfection and right after slowing down there is nothing better than feel the explosion and airbag coming into your ears again,5.00,1343
the fact that radiohead would disavow dark side of the moon as an influence tells you how much deepening of their selfawareness they still needed to do between this and the first thing they did that might begin to deserve such hyperbolic praise kid a and while i do not have much against the rest of pink floyds discography given the binary choice i am glad this sites algorithm favors ok computer though i do wish 1 were something interesting like trout mask replica or lil boat you know just spice it up a bit this is a stronger album than dark side not least because mercifully they seem to have stumbled accidentally into a big concept album about the tragic inanity of modern life or somesuch by accident while much of the songwriting is overwrought it tends to be operating at the liminal space between what consciousness can and cannot confront directly in lived experience that tends to make for good poetry i cannot believe that roger waters was grappling with a problem that needed his talents when he wrote lines like us and them  and after all we are only ordinary men but at his best thom yorke already sounds like a gen x jeremiah the panic the screaming the yuppies networking riot shields and voodoo economics he is like a detuned radio one day i am going to grow wings even having heard this album so damn many times much of it is still riveting and little of it i am looking at you subterranean homesick alien is irredeemably hokey by any standard except conceptual sweep to be fair pink floyd is not the right comparison in order to make it to these upper flaps of the snob rock big tent radiohead had to absorb and rejigger the canon of charting but still tasteful rock that would emerged in the last 15 year from rem to the smiths to u2 this album could not have made such a splash if the latter were not the predominant formal model through which to channel the two former and as a result it suffers from the same problem christgau diagnosed in the joshua tree a tragic case of significance the difference being that the band seem to already have enough of an inkling to recognize it that they could coursecorrect i am no steve albini but the bigness of the production and the relative lushness of the singing often lay it on too thick for my tastes i am going to the deprivations they would subject themselves to across their next couple albums are at least as important as their electronic experiments look at all the adulation drowning this album here on the site and consider the wisdom and courage it must have taken to so fundamentally change course,4.00,2577
if it was not for these guys i would have ended up far more happy and successful the album that started my rot too good,5.00,119
i have a sneaking suspicion that if radiohead were film composers instead of a rock band i would probably consistently give them 5s for every album they made they do an incredible job at creating surreal atmospheres throughout this entire album but i also constantly finding the actual substance of the songs to beok,3.00,316
such a perfect articulation of such a colossal spectrum of emotion that further discussion is basically equivalent to insulting the artists i have no problem at all with this being declared the best album ever,5.00,209
hello guys today i am in the mood to talk about radioheads album ok computer why does it rank first on rym maybe because it neither depresses your mood nor gets on your brains but instead it challenges a sense of unrealness and a desire to fly away and even not to fly away but to float in weightlessness a man always wants something impossible the first ranking does not mean the best forever and for everybody it is impossible and impossible does not mean unreal in any case you are sure of it as long as you listen to this music,5.00,531
today there are so many people stating that one music album is the best music album ever that seems impossible to the disheartened listener to believe such claims ever again but i was so glad that for once an album not only met these conditions but by far exceeded them defending myself from being charged for exaggeration i will start presenting the reasons music and songs  after listening to many different music albums i had formed the opinion that every song is a different entity inside an album like a living being ok computer was the first album that managed to broaden my musical horizons and opinion making each one of the single living beings a part of a bigger existence a society the album as a whole while maintaining their uniqueness the songs even though each one different have a smooth transition from one to another giving a strong impression that the whole album is one songwhile it is not the highlytalented musicians of radiohead come to boost the significance of this experience with their great guitar drums and synthesizer parts in each song while complimenting the lyrics meaning the guitar sounds alien in subterranean homesick alien the guitar and drums sound paranoid in the existential and unique paranoid android lyrics  the lyrics of this specific album hold a great importance because they are not just expressing concerns and thoughts about our present and future society they are making social and political commentary on an era that is changing rapidly in all levels centered on the technological advance the album express the stress and fear of the citizens about this advance while not forgetting the political manipulations that push forward these advances when needed creativity  the songs sound different with the brilliant conducting of nick ingman feel different when taking in consideration the inspired lyrics and can be considered one entity if this is not creative please feel free to tell me so lasting impression and value  this is a haunting experience never before a music album felt so refreshing inspiring thoughtful and creative while reflecting the emotions of some deeply concerned with the societys problems music artists that is when a band of artists produces a timeless music album because art is timeless,4.50,2265
what am i missing with such an impossible amount of praise and esteem placed on ok computer i cannot help but wonder how much effect it has on my judgment but all i have are my current thoughts which are that it is just not doing it for me all that much just nice moments here and there,4.00,286
this is the album that is number one on the rym charts this is the album that has over 26000 ratings at the time of this review this is the album where nearly half the ratings are 5 stars this is the album held in the highest esteem by fans of radiohead this is the album by the best band ever according to my exboss this is the album that must be listened to by all music lovers this is the album by the band that redefined the very idiom that is modern music this is the album that may change the way you think about music this is the album that has two of the greatest songs of all time in paranoid android and karma police this is the album that is tragically poetic lyrically clever and poignant this is the album that is the soundtrack of the worlds pain and anguish this is the album for artrock lovers whose vocabularies are brimming with superlative descriptors this is the album i have played several times attempting to find inspiration this is the album that did not deliver what i was attempting to find this is the album where the vocals are dispensed in the whineiest manner imaginable this is the album where thom yorke appears to be suffering for his art this is the album that just might have been ok without him this is the album that is mostly devoid of rhythm or melody this is the album that is overly melancholic and dull this is the album that has very little that is appealing to me this is the album that explains why i did not see eye to eye with my exboss this is the album i am happy to have heard but will now ignore forever this is the album we might disagree on but i could not care less this is the review that will barely see the light of day as it is quickly buried under a pile of selfcongratulatory wank delete ok,2.00,1750
a wellproduced philosophically deep release which touches on public surveillance dissatisfaction with material wealth and other such issues and effectively throws these big messy issues out in the open in a tremendously admirable way but also a release that aside from remarkably progressive tracks like fitter happier ultimately boils down to an awkward mix of grunge and britpop slathered in so many effects and big ideas that it became the new big thing to follow despite being painfully awkward apathetic and bloated,2.50,520
i do not understand how this is considered to be the greatest album of all time it was interesting but even within radioheads discography i would take kid a over this album i will definitely be listening to this album multiple times to try to let it sink in deeper as should be done with any album with a sense of artistic integrity,3.50,332
i honestly believe the gucci little piggy set thom straight before 97 during the bends era thom was writing songs about anxiety the negative aspects of fame isolation and destruction among other themes after the gucci incident thom was writing songs of anxiety the negative aspects about fame isolation and destruction among other themes only this time they were sophisticated ok computer essentially expanded upon and improved the bends airbag  saved thom yorkes life the carcrash did thom well as he crafted an intriguing song he gives two thumbs up to the german auto industry as well as the tibetan belief of reincarnation the band also acknowledges the cure in one of the songs motif the star of this track though is phil kudos to him for the way he handled those robotic beatz paranoid android is a sophisticated rhapsody complex in nature with alternating rhythms and time signatures this is the origin of the little piggy as epic as it is paranoid does not achieve what it set out to achieve and that is making the band not take themselves seriously ah well this subterranean homesick alien sure knows his melody the ethereal soundscape this song produces is beyond comprehension thom dissects human nature from the eyes of aliens trippy exit music for romeo and juliet it also saved marylin mansons life i do not know how you should take that let down is one hell of a contender for most depressing song in the album it is also the one song that unifies all the loose concepts into one truly a masterpiece fit for anyones rock standards list karma policephew for a minute there i lost my cell check that ending out fitter happier is the song that influenced me to buy microwave dinners got to go get my antibiotics electioneering is as clear as a diamond sadly it is as rough as one too solid song but nothing more to it climbing up the walls is dexters theme it is also the theme to everyone is inner demons with malice afterthoughts easily replaceable with palo alto so we hit the carbon monoxide inducing no surprises contending for the most depressing song in the album no surprises is yorkes reaction to the systematic destruction of citizens by contemporary society do not drown lucky is my favorite song from the album those flamenco guitars made me break down crying in the middle of a plane trip seriously the tourist should be played in every single subway across the world the ending bing sound puts the finishing touches to one of the greatest artistic statement in history it is no surprise ok computer is one of the greatest experiences of all time this includes websites musicvideofilms artworks stanley is a beast and of course the album itself this is how i view ok computer not as an album but as a work of multimedia art this will always be radioheads magnum opus,5.00,2791
and i even like this album there but you are right it is definitely too high ,3.50,77
damn good album is it just me or are these remasters an actual improvement on original nigel godrich did a hell of a job on the boards every sonic detail really glides is how i can explain it like sun pouring over ice the rhythm section and keyboards really carries the day on songs like airbag i listened to a few 90s pop hits recently i think the thing that lot of 90s nostalgists overlook is impact of hip hop on rock drummers them breaks the jazzy shuffle on paranoid android and the bells an whistles xylophones i think really trick this out and that rich and melodic bass does much more than hold the rythm every player knows when to drop out or make space for the other really great b sides first time i have heard most of them i think he made his millions mewling and caterwualing over johnnys guitar arpeggios i wonder what radiohead would have been like had they continued in this proggy i never payed as much attention to how much the keyboard adds to the mix the remixes are surprisingly not shite never was a zero 7 booster fitter happier and electioneering are better than i remembered what else can i say not my number 1 but it certainly has greatness in it,5.00,1172
so the journey begins starting with the 1 alltime rym album and working down  one day at a time until exhaustion can this really be 16 years old it stands as a pure crystalline structure a true work of art i stand in awe of the ambition and forethought that went into this album whether intentional or not they composed the future 16 years ago before my palate had developed i felt this album to be highly toploaded i now see the album as a whole with the schizophrenic paranoid opening followed by the sense of resignation it is a scary yet beautifully realized vision kudos how could you not rate this album a 5 to do so would be to disregard all antecedents and the direction of the music that followed greatest album of all time i do not think so but i will try hard to prove it so greatest album of the past 20 years  yes  high point 250 into exit music for a film when the drums and that scuzzed out bass hit wow,5.00,918
ok computer is an incredibly layered paranoid work its originality means that it has not aged a day and it will remain one of the great albums of the 1990s,5.00,155
god loves his children compared to later radiohead releases ok computer just seems like a foundation do not get me wrong the songs are excellent with classics such as the tourist paranoid android and karma police and the overall feel of the album the themes the haunting lyrics the hollow sounds and spine chilling textures make this an extremely thought provoking release that not only changed the face of alt rock but pushed the whole genre of rock to new boundaries it deserves all the praise it has garnered most certainly but kid a is much much better numerous albums can take ryms 1 album spot and while ok computer certainly is not anywhere near bad radiohead and many other artists have done much better highlights  karma police  paranoid android  exit music for a film  the tourist  subterranean homesick alien,4.00,819
i do not know this is kind of a step down from the bends for me the music could use a shot in the arm and thom yorkes attempts at sounding worldweary and depressed come off sounding more like he is bored the album as a whole blends together in this mushy bog of feedback and overly drawnout syllables some good melodies though particularly in paranoid android and electioneering and i appreciate the attempt at expanding their sound,3.00,432
this album gives me so many feels it really is better than kid a not that kid a was a bad album it was a great album this is just slightly better,4.50,145
an acquired taste i thought it was crap on first listen mainly because it was soo different to the music that was going around at the time but after several more listens i loved it,4.00,180
i was not always a huge fan of radiohead for a long period of my life i found their music hard to get into and at times rather dull they were one of the most acclaimed british bands of all time and i just did not get it one year i went to the leeds festival and they were headlining and despite a lot of my friends being excited about the prospect of seeing them i just was not fussed as i was not a fan despite this i thought i would go and see them anyway as i heard they were good live and by the end of their set i finally did get it to describe their show using a word which does not do it justice it was mindblowing i stubbornly tried not to pursue my interest in them as i wanted to stick to my word of not being a fan but i just could not help myself i fell in love with them and felt like such an idiot for previously dismissing their clearly incredible music my friends would tease me about the huge youturn i did in regards to my stance on radiohead but i did not care i finally knew just why so many regard them as one of the greatest bands ever during a period of listening to little else but thom yorkes intricate innovative boundary pushing conglomerate of world class musicians i came to find that ok computer is my favourite album of theirs a lot of people cite kid a as their finest work and i agree that it is an incredible album but there is something so irrepressibly epic about this album it marks the point between where they were still a conventional guitar band and where they delved into uncharted musical territory the songs are primarily guitar driven but the guitars are used to create noises that you would not expect paranoid android is one of the greatest songs ever written period it has been compared to queens bohemian rhapsody many times not surprising both songs begin in a rather quiet place before becoming louder and louder before culminating in an explosive climax which features iconic guitar work but whilst bohemian rhapsody is an epic opus of glam and stadium rock glory paranoid android is anything but glorious it is nihilistic and bitter cynical and schizophrenic volatile and misanthropic the tempos change the guitars become gnarlier and the vocals become angrier the band have said that they wrote the song as a joke strange because jokes serve the basic purpose of making someone laugh not making someone feel several emotions the other singles are amazing too no surprises with it is distinctive guitar hook is a rather poignant but cathartic number whilst the slow paced lucky is pure bleakness featuring guitars that make the darkness sound beautiful karma police is like the twisted demented cousin of oasis do not look back in anger that song is like an affable friend whilst this one is a lone creepy person the album is consistently great airbag emits textures of ambience using nothing but guitars and electioneering is the sound of the apocalypse if you could hear someone playing an amazing guitar solo whilst the world is being destroyed around you just when the golden period of british rock which was the 1990s looked like it was starting to die with oasis releasing the self indulgent coke addled and critically panned but nonetheless good be here now blur looking to the american grunge bands for influences as opposed to writing their usual quirky pop songs pulp also wanting to avoid the britpop sound which made them popular and the manic street preachers losing their angry punkesque nihilisim in favour of radio friendly anthems radiohead emerged with this masterpiece they showed to the world that there was more to music from the united kingdom than britpop and as opposed to the fun anthemic poppy songs of britpop this album is anything but it is dark brooding and misanthropic and better than definitely maybe parklife and different class the only british albums from the 1990s that i can think of which are superior to ok computer are the holy bible by the manic street preachers and pulps this is hardcore two albums which are also dark and uncomfortable to listen to and are the sound of a band deliberately trying to alienate casual listeners for the sake of artistic license moral of the story is give any band a chance do not dismiss them just because you do not like the sound of them and if you follow that rule you may end up reaping the rewards of it like i was with radiohead,5.00,4363
with an album as renowned and legendary as ok computer you would think that all contemporary reviews could just be whittled down to a generic what can be said about this album that has not already been said but that is not the case 20 years later and people are still finding things to say about this album maybe it is because younger people keep discovering maybe it is because people find that its themes of technological anxiety are being more relevant with time maybe it is both especially with its 20th anniversary this year it is been back in the spotlight and the center of dozens of articles on music sites one i saw from pitchfork described fitter happiers lyrics as robot overlords commands for humans or something like that i know music is very subjective but i do not think i am alone in thinking that pitchfork is way off with that interpretation thom yorke himself has called fitter happiers lyrics as the most depressing thing he is ever written the track is not much more than a list of mundane qualities and lifestyle choices that are typically deemed desirable and by the general public tv magazines our peers they all tell us that going to the gym is good safe cars are good eating healthily is good everybody should do these things everybody on earth should be the same and live this ideal western lifestyle and what do you say to this list no i do not want to eat healthy or get along with coworkers or worry about my safety of course not you would be an asshole thom says these are his most depressing lyrics and i think it is because the advice this robotic voice is giving is not bad advice a lot of the things he said would lead to the ideal life you could stray from this advice but what would it lead to reckless behaviour binge drinking an irritating personality and ultimately social isolation the title of the album is an allusion to the submissive acceptance of the sterile benign instructions for a normal life he is not saying i shall do your bidding computer but he is also not saying no way fuck your advice computer it is just an unenthused ok computer i think that is why people find this album so depressing because it is an acceptance of the societal assimilation of uniqueness no use fighting it you cannot survive unless you conform to the way the world works a more and more calculated lifestyle the only casualty is a unique human experience ok,4.50,2387
when it comes to rock music and its million subgenres i am barely scratching the surface the reason for that is that with the exception of a few albums i used to not care for rock in reality i just thought that i did not like rockbecause i was so close minded i have since broadened my musical horizons and realized that there are gems in nearly every genre of the many gems i have discovered in rock this album is one of the best given it is high reputation i expected to think that it is overrated even taking into consideration that rym is more rockoriented than i will ever be however i love this album i could spend all day describing the technical details that make it great but ultimately what it boils down to is that this is simply put fantastic music that is all there is to it it is rock but it is for everyone not just rock fans if you do not like sad music ok then maybe this album is not for you but for everyone else i do not see what is not to love this album has great vocals excellent instrumentation several classic songs a great overall vibe subtle influences from a variety of genres and a perfect balance of experimentation and accessibility if you do not like this album i guess i cannot complain because music is a highly subjective art form however i will not agree with you in the slightest this album is amazing it makes me want to dig into radioheads discography and it is one of the albums that has inspired me to dig deeper into rock music in general it is a rock classic if i ever heard one rating 455,4.50,1532
this is one of the last major albums before the mp3 era forced most artists back to focus on singles just like in the 1950s just about every song on this album is an epic anthem that set radiohead a new rock standard for the late 90s and much of the following decade this album was a complete break with the past and most of the songs on this album still get under your skin and every time you listen to the album again it just seems to get even better solid guitar riffs are very effectively interspersed with ethereal choirs with vocalist thom yorke in particular being a constant that keeps everything at a very high level paranoid android in particular is considered the ultimate song on this album it contains so many layers that it continues to surprise and make you plunge from one emotion to the next obviously we are dealing with some genius musicians here who know how to make a song gain momentum this is not about a lookmomwithouthands attitude but really about song structures that many can learn from and that made radiohead perhaps the biggest group of the 90s in any case this album can be added to the select list of timeless classics and is undoubtedly one of the top albums of the 90s,5.00,1203
the most overrated album of all time hold on but it is not that bad,4.00,67
picture a chilly winter morning inside a university classroom the professor was running so late that i had enough time to be able to listen to this album in its entirety before he finally arrived and i will always remember that time whenever i sit down and listen to this release ok computer is at the point where radiohead began experimenting with their musical formula going beyond the britpop sound found on their previous releases thom yorkes ethereal vocals synergize well with the creative use of rock instruments present throughout the album the low ambient atmosphere of this release lulls the listener into a sense of peace and heightened observation in order to try and detect what exactly yorke is trying to say in these songs the tracks here are quality alternative rock that capture the experimental nature of the late 1990s and can please most anyone standouts are airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien let down and electioneering with fitter happier as an honorable mention for its exclusive use of voice synthesizers of which i am a fan,4.50,1066
this is the album that got me into radiohead and it will always hold a special place in my heart because of it truly incredible the emotion in airbag gets me every time,4.50,168
mindblowing at least for the time now its just a pretty good record,4.00,67
ok so i have got a challenge for you this weekend you may have already listened to it in full but it is worth it to hear again listen to ok computer all the way through with some ear buds on that is one of the most nostalgic albums for me man and my early days working at shaw that takes me back to a time when i was still kind of fat and goofy which i mean to be fair that will be a trait i am always stuck fighting but needless to say my mind was in a different spot i was into my first year of marriage at shaw when i first started out there and nothing was very easy for me i had a hard transition into marriage and work and living on my own for the first time but this album made that 145 ride from downtown dalton to conn 3 something i looked forward to i can remember when my group in qc had a cd player near the roll prep area if you were cutting plastic off the rolls you could blare music and i remember putting in ok computer and everybody just staring at each other like this are not kz 106 or this are not pop but nobody fuckin did anything about iti honestly believe they did not touch it or say anything because i have caught some shit for some of the stuff i have listened to in there because this is one of the best albums of all time nothing has ever sounded like it it managed to be super melon collie and more tuneful and as heavy as a smashing pumpkin song and being as tippy as anything on dark side of the moon it is beautiful i am sure there is at least 50 guitar pedals used on this fuckin thing and they all sound awesome i mean i am in fucking tears right now listening to this shit it is just that i have had so much on my plate lately and everything in this world has gotten so fuckin rough i am not trying to sound like a pussy but maybe i have just holding on to too much baggage i do not know i am fine now but for a minute i just needed to cry but i got to ask myself now if things were any easier back then you know,5.00,1949
i am warming up to this i have been reading hitch hikers guide to the galaxy decided to lazily put paranoid android on spotify while fucking around on my laptop and i love it went and gave the whole album a listen the majority bored me it was through great determination i finished the album but i did find a few diamonds in the rough namely karma police electioneering and no surprises still nowhere near the outright quality of kid a the only radiohead album i can say i enjoy but maybe after i let this sink in i will have two radiohead albums i can stomach maybe,3.00,566
radiohead is the example of a band getting some critical acclamation and people jump on the bandwagon and also giving acclamation and it grows to the point where people without a clue about music are rating radiohead a 5 not because they like them but because not doing so would not be cool call me uncool,3.00,305
sonic perfection the best concept album ever createdyea i went there i feel really bad for people who do not like this album,5.00,124
you cannot believe so much evolution in such a short time they realized the capacity they had and exploited it here the best of the best ,5.00,137
in the mid 90s i loved the bends and also thought pablo honey had its charms ok computer came out and i thought that while it is had some good tunes without being able to put my finger on it i just felt there was something not quite right about it a couple of years after it came out on a christmas eve in fact i was coming down with the chicken pox although i did not actually know it yet i was feeling a bit spacey and a bit out of it and had this record on and it is the first time i remember it clicking with me specifically the song lucky this was when i realised that the something not quite right feeling was purposefully built into the album by radiohead it was the essence of what the band wanted to get across since i first came up with my favourite 10 albums of all time list probably 14 or 15 years ago now there have been a couple of changes but ok computer has been a consant it is gotten better with age and now never fails to blow my mind its records like this that make me so passionate about music airbag introduces the album with a riff that is got a hint of the east about it but the vocals guitars and rhythm section come together beautifully to begin this masterpiece only radiohead could write something so magical about a car safety device this leads into the epic paranoid android up there with bohemian rhapsody as one of those songs whose creation process will raise as many questions as the origins of the universe itself the paranoia levels are maintained across the rest of the album at its heart is the track let down a song that just swells with downbeat emotion and is one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded by a rock band electioneering and climbing up the walls give you that frantic feeling of being stuck in a broken elevator and are particularly easy to relate to these days no surprises calms everything back down and the album cruises to a relaxed finish with lucky and the tourist alot of my friends are big music fans and i would have a high degree of respect their opinions some of them just do not get this record maybe they need to listen to it while coming down with the chicken pox ,5.00,2136
i struggle to find words to describe my love for this album incredible amazing mindblowing and transcendent are just a few that i can come up with admittedly the first time i heard the album i did not really think much of it then on the second time i was blown away by it by far my favorite album,5.00,296
this album is often hailed as radioheads masterpiece but i am inclined to disagree it loses its potency about halfway through starting at the godawful fitter happier and never fully recovers until the tourist but hey all of the songs before that are actually quite amazing hell if the first six songs and perhaps the tourist were released on an ep and everything else scrapped ok computer would have likely been one of the best eps of the 90s anyways let us start on a light note by talking about the first several tracks this album kicks off with airbag which is probably my favorite song off of this album it is one of radioheads best upbeat songs and manages to be fairly creative and highly atmospheric while still be very accessible paranoid android is also an amazing track and likely the most successfully experimental track off of ok computer smoothly transitioning though several completely different phases before it ends somewhat suddenly to great effect subterranean homesick alien probably the lushest song here with heavy use of electronic instrumentation and effects exit music for a film is probably the heaviest track and is actually genuinely depressing it is fairly minimalistic and actually seems to predict the general direction of radioheads next album kid a let downs titled is misleading because it is not actually a letdown ha ha look guys i made a funny laugh with me laugh at my joke please  hell let down is probably the most upbeat song on this album even though it is not as out there as the other highlights after that is karma police which is likely the most popular song off of ok computer and it is easy to see why it is probably the best song lyrically and the music really captures the vibe radiohead seems to be going for this would have been a great end to ok computer if it was an ep but sadly fitter happier had to happen really the term pretentious hipster bullshit has never been more applicable to a song than here i can sort of see what radiohead was going for here but they really miss the mark fitter happier might have worked as an intro to a longer song but on its own it is shit as bad as fitter happier is at least it still kept with ok computers general mood the next song electioneering although a fairly solid rocker is completely out of place here climbing up the walls is probably the most unmemorable track on this album and beyond that there is not too much to say no surprises is actually pretty good but is also a bit out of place although not as nearly as much as electioneering is lucky is another unmemorable tune like climbing up the walls but does manage to be somewhat more interesting after all of this shit ok computer actually manages to finish up on a high note with the tourist which is pretty damn breathtaking it is just a shame so much mediocre and out of place material came before it so what is the final verdict on ok computer well i can some it up as an album with a great first half a mediocre second half and a great end if you cut out all of the out of place and flat out bad material ok computer would live up to its reputation still the good tracks are good enough so i would feel bad to give it anything lower than a 4 out of 5 it is also a big step forward for radiohead and they did seem to be experimenting a lot it is just that they would end up doing much better on later releases if the bland tracks were distributed throughout the album rather than all concentrated in the second half i would probably rate it higher when you really think about it ok computer is an example of how the tracklist organization can actually end up ruining an album anyways i just do not see what the big deal is here as the ever so infamous piero scaruffi said radiohead is basically faux avantgarde however unlike him i do not see ok computer as the masterpiece of it edit my opinion of this album has shifted a bit since i last reviewed it and probably not for the better still think the second half is definitely the weakest aside from the tourist but i find the whole album a bit lacking,3.50,4061
i give this 05 stars just to bring it down from alltime 2  to where it belongs maybe somewhere about 200 for its influence maybe this album explains how crappy the 20002010 decade was the only two songs that actually show respect toward the listener are subterranean homesick alien and lucky paranoid android and karma police have probably been recorded to torture prisoners in guantnamo i loved in rainbows and i think johnny greenwood is one of the greatest musicians alive but seriously id rather run a full marathon with a rotting corpse shackled to my feet than having to sit through the whole of this album,0.50,612
i cannot deny how pretty jonny plays karma police is mediocre at best  definitely the worst song on the album best songs subterranean homesick alien airbag no surprises let down,4.50,177
among my fathers favourites  guy mitchell perry como andy williams roger whittaker doris day val doonican connie francis mario lanza on hearing ok computer two weeks ago he remarked hey these guys are pretty good i want his grandchildren to be in a band like radiohead i want them to sing like thom yorke fuck around like the boy greenwood that son of a bitch obrien i want them to be pussies like radiohead tough vicious bastards like radiohead cold cynical beautiful lost heartbroken ecstatic with enlightenment so in control they nearly puke all over themselves so smug they buzz around like flies near the turds of whatever generation they will surely disown after they hear this just like their future grandpa did,5.00,718
two important things about ok computer 1 it is not the best album ever 2 it is not a pile of talentless shit either ok computer is an obvious example of specific taste this is a love it or hate it album for the most part its eerie odd all over the place and somewhat distant its solid in what it is but by no means does it impress me its a good album worth the time of anyone who desires to hear every kind of music at least once like i am if you simply want to search for the sound you want and know it is out there but do not know what that sound is you do have to check this album out for yourself do not follow any ones overwhelming opinions like the 2 examples i used and if you do check this album out good luck friend  what a cryptic statement of mine that is its about a year later since that review whatever it is and i have decided after extensive musical discoveries since then to start the year 2013 with a radiohead day because their discography really is one i need to get through having listen to every album twice more or less and relistening to ok computer i would like to say i have a much much much better grip and understanding of this band so here it goes my much better review of ok computer starting with airbag this song is way better than i remember making me think of our lady peaces naveed and then the surprising warping of noise at the end which i have to say i really like now i hear paranoid android is considered still to this day one of radioheads best songs and they might be right its very powerful and kind of like airbag but with more purpose and emotion something this album suddenly feels to weigh out to me  purpose subterranean homesick alien is rather spacious and easy though it glides and does not feel like a pointless we need this ballad like many songs of this structure feel to me in later albums i never really got why people compared muse to radiohead but now let down has showed it to me damn but i will say let down is beautiful again spacious and with real not forced emotion and some since of strange purpose very very good song karma police is another very just wow rather genuine and clean not stained by the ego i think this band gains in later years to me this album is just working on music not on the image radio head seems to garner after this album maybe this is what happened this was the catalyst i think i am getting it now more about that later more reminding me of our lady peace with electioneering which has some killer guitar which most of the album really does the back and forth with the upbeat and melancholy really gives an odd but delightful vibe to this album something i feel is lost on later albums actually the prime example is after the happy and energetic electioneering you get saturated in melancholy with the dismal and powerful climbing up the walls i guess they thought hey let us get even sadder with no surprises but i will say there is a slight feeling of hopefulness in those lullaby like twinkles and atmosphere besides really good guitar and that deep space feeling on very song lucky and the tourist just follow in the steps of climbing up the walls and no surprises but not as good i guess but there is not a bad song on this album not at all hopefully i understand this album way better now than i did a year ago i feel like i do its pure its genuine and very common and that makes it rather uncommon i feel like the albums to follow do not possess this genuine feeling not trying to say they lost themselves but rather found themselves and knew what to do therefore radiohead gained much confidence and cockiness therefore losing their modesty but they are still really talented so i guess i guess its ok,4.50,3700
so this is one of the top albums ever according to the site well i do like my radiohead and though this album is rather good this is not even my favourite album with the band the album still has a lot of creativity variations in both songs styles and tempo but so do most others of the bands albums as well good groovy and thoms voice suits the whole and also manage to deliver feelings through the music,3.50,404
the so praised by british critics ok computer the supposed sgt peppers of the 90s the truth is that it tells me absolutely nothing easy songs normal musicians a singer with a very affected pose no innovation a lot of atmospheres and electronic arrangements and little else i will not say that the album sucks paranoid android and karma police save it but even any album by for example some dire straits gives a hundred kicks to this what is the reason for the hype of this album then i have a couple of theories about it and i do not like any of them,2.50,550
ok computer is one of very few albums that allow the listener to inhabit a whole different world it is an emotional cry for a sense of sanity in the late hours of any given night one of the greatest most transcendent musical achievements in the history of human civilization,5.00,274

so now i have finally dared to seriously listen to what according to rym is the 1 album of all times which i have always strongly doubted  i listened to this once about 10 years ago it did not leave any memories my first impression was although the music is interesting complex and often beautiful  i just cannot stand thom yorkes singing that bloody nagging bratty voice and this moaning singing that was oh so en vogue in 90s britpop it gets on my nerves on a very basic primal level so i knew i would not be able to really enjoy this album especially the tourist really hurts my ears however on further listens i started getting a little used to that voice and the songs where yorkes singing stays in the background started growing on me like airbag and subterranean homesick alien it was not too artsyfartsy as i feared the production is immaculate and the songs are full of little surprises synth details interesting twists without breaking apart staying a coherent pleasing whole and that exactly is my gripe with this album it s a little too coherent and pleasing for me to really raise my interest it all feels too intellectual too thoughtout too selfconscious too slick and polished to me for me great music needs more than just a pleasing melancholic mood melancholy sells well it needs more than sophistication and ideas  it needs an element of irrationality of spontaneity and exuberance of revolt and fracturedness of personality which ok computer just does not have and thus it cannot compare with ie angel dust my own personal perfect 1990s alt rock album and of course great music needs a voice that does not piss me off considering this the fact i have this album a good rating is no minor feat it is no coincidence that my favourite on here is fitter happier this weird text read by some microsoft windows 3xstyle computer voice  this is the only song that has some genuine darkness and experimentality and none of that nasty voice all in all as much as i would have liked pompous ass that i am i cannot say this is a bad album quite on the contrary it is a remarkable britpop album with a proggish edge for mature mainstream altindie audience and i understand now why it is so popular but no way would i call it greatest album ever,3.50,2250
its a good album of a good band but beatles pink floyd led zeppelin and other big bands albums are much better than ok computer a believe that most people that vote here does not know this fantastic albums,0.50,205
this is artificial beauty beautiful anyway,4.00,42
i do not understand why this is the best album ever i mean yeah is good and it has some radios anthems paranoid surprises karma butreally the best ever there are some reeeeeally boring parts and thoms voice does not help in there still yeahmost of the album is remarkable i agree with you guys highlights airbag paranoid android fitter happier no surprises,4.00,356
i have interesting feelings over this album if you were to strip away every single concept from this album it sounds pretty alright it is atmospheric and melancholy in strange jagged ways and that is kind of neat it does it well enough that i think this would probably be a really nice experience for some people it is a little too lacking in energy and purpose to appeal to me for more than a few songs at a time but still it is not bad and it is not exceptional and it fills your ears in a respectably pleasant consistent way and for that i give it the score it has so what about the concepts actually  that overarching oh woe is me i am so sophisticated and modernity is making me so lifeless and purposeless thing irritates the crap out of me and as a result i cannot really warm up to the genuinely decent melodies on here or maybe more fairly ok computer sets all this whining to music that does not do anything interesting with it and that irritates the crap out of me it is kind of a shame that ok computer is so layered in concept because it would have been a reasonably enjoyable album if it did not sound so much like emo for adults,3.50,1143
making your way through a technological wasteland let down is one of the greatest things to happen,4.50,98
rym rates this album as the best of all time i disagree that spot comes close between dark side of the moon and abbey road but ok computer is not  kid a is better  well anyway its a great album and the only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star album is fitter happier  seriously wtf where they thinking  and lucky  it is very overrated average song ,4.50,352
overrated radiohead for me is like u2 in the years of achtung baby however less danceable more depressed but nothing revolutionary just the usual british rock,3.50,158
i have owned this on cd about five or six times its always close by always gets fucked eventually always absolutely essential for me to get it again,5.00,148
the singing sometimes sounds mumblymoaning the last song or two is kind of boring and i find fitter happier to be kind of pretentious but over all a pretty damn good album,4.00,171
the pinnacle of radioheads career before the need to be groundbreaking took over,3.50,80
when ok computer radiohead was released in 97 i mostly associated it with britpop and was slightly dismayed by the positive reviews especially in the uk in the end at the sale in poznas rocklongluck i also bought a cassette and got it completely the album is absolutely unique and in my opinion the top achievement of radiohead unfortunately no later album can be compared to ok computer,5.00,387
this is a good album but hardly a great one to be honest i have listened to it a few times but never feel inclined to pick it out specially  there is too much other good music out there while sounding of its time there is very little here that is particularly original  guitardriven rock played at a moderate tempo with some electronic effects thrown in  not particularly melodic the best tracks are karma police and no surprises and we will excuse radiohead using the chords from the beatles sexy sadie on the former  if you are going to copy from someone else why not copy from the best generally therefore a pleasant enough listen but hardly essential airbag  25 paranoid android  35 subterranean homesick alien  3 exit music  3 let down  25 karma police  4 fitter happier  1 climbing up the walls  2 no surprises  4 lucky  3 the tourist  35,2.50,844
they do not like to be associated with prog but there is no denying that on ok computer radiohead went fullon art rock whilst i do not think it is a fivestar classic  it flags a little too much in the second half for that and fitter happier is just too ludicrously over the top and juvenile for words  it does attain higher peaks than any prior radiohead albumthe albums masterpiece is of course the pocket symphony which is paranoid android  beginning as a political rant segueing into a strungout hymn and then returning to the angry diatribe for the conclusion and in the course of all this proving to the alternative rock crowd that there was something to be gained from cribbing from updating the ideas of the art rock heroes of the past,4.50,742
hands down the best 1997 album featuring that annoying microsoft voice guy thing after made from technetium,0.50,107
easy music easy hooks and riffs too light at the same time mildly depressing its got nothing on kid a i cannot get into this yes of course it works and of course the songwriting is excellent but it leaves me feeling a bit hollow guitar driven pop songs with an idiosyncratic broody distinctly radiohead atmosphere on top its unfulfilling,3.50,337
it is the symphonie of the feeling that most afflicts to human race the pain it is a journey through the pure essence we have fought against since our origin at the moment we are born until we die we experience that feeling all the time thom yorke and company do open heart surgery and expose us the aesthetics of pain,5.00,318
i have always put off listening to this lp since 1997 it has not aged well it is higher quality than most pop music in 1997,2.50,123
note i want to have a review written for at least the top 50 albums by the time this summer is over this is the first review in that project when this album was released i was a year and a half old i doubt my dad ever played it for me when i was so young actually talking to him about the album years later when i was fourteen or fifteen he explained to me that it took him six months to buy it because he wanted to wait for the hype to die down he was afraid that if he bought it right away he would be disappointed after the soaring angstfilled yet beautiful the bends my dad was among the many waiting for the best pop album of all time it is probably for the best that he tempered his expectations this album was not made for him he still enjoyed it of course  but radiohead had something else in mind it is actually strange to me then because this is the first album i have a distinct memory of listening to really listening to free of distractions giving my full attention i was in third grade my dad would play fitter happier sometimes and i thought it was funny i thought the song itself was called ok computer i had a shitty little cd player i would had it for a few years then by this point it had lost the ability to skip tracks so i popped in the cd and figured i would just wait for it to get to track 7 thought it would only take a few minutes i do not remember what i thought of airbag then but i do remember listening to paranoid android for the first time very clearly the eerie jangly guitar that opens the song grabbed my attention immediately and the sudden mood shifts scared the crap out of me it was probably the most progressive song i had heard up till that point but i do not know for sure but i remember it so clearly the problem with this album and writing about it is that it is become impossible for me  and so many others  to separate their emotional bonds with it from the musics actual individual merit but i think that is in part because thom yorke and co did such a brilliant job at tapping right into the reservoirs of existential angst that were following us as the 90s turned over into the new millennium even exit music for a film which could have been a simple throwaway track for the romeo  juliet soundtrack has the haunting mellotron arrangement gently whispered vocals the jawdropping drum break and of course the eerie samples during the fade out and it is basically the best song ever written for a movie in my opinion yet it was not even nominated for the original song oscar wonder why i know i rated a stretch of tracks 4 and under  but that is in part because those tracks do not really transcend the beauty of the album well karma police was a victim of being awfully overplayed it is a good tune but i am a little bitter that it was the most successful single from the album here in the yous electioneering is a great rocker and would be a highlight on any other album but here it plays it safe in comparison to the crazy innovations we see elsewhere on the album climbing up the walls is brilliant and the string arrangement is mindblowing but it is also so painfully bleak that it is tough for me to listen to when i am not listening to the album straight through but i would not bat an eye if someone else were to cite them as a highlight they are just not what stood out to me but i feel the album hits its peaks when thom mixes cautious optimism into the albums generally bleak uncertain mood no surprises is a bright but melancholy song and it is unbelievable to me that it reached the top 10 in the youk and then there is let down let down is probably my favorite song of all time that is partially because it is gotten me through lots of tough times but it is also brilliant musically let me outline why i think this for you 1 the guitar is playing in a different time signature than the rest of the song this plays back into the songs general idea of trying to find your place in the world 2 each element of the song gets more and more confident as the song goes on for example the uncertain guitar which opens the song shifts to being assertively strummed at the songs climax similarly thoms vocals which at first sound fragile and vulnerable shift to confident graceful and soaring 3 the lyrical turns of phrase allow the songs chorus one day i am going to grow wingsa chemical reaction to turn from an ironic scathing comment on todays society ie there are so many chemicals in the world that i will mutate grow wings and escape to a lifeaffirming sentiment when they are prefaced with you will know you will know where you are 4 when the harmonies kick in at 400 it is perhaps my favorite moment in any song and has moved me to tears several times 5 the outro  which consists of an acoustic guitar and arpeggiating synths  has the comforting effect which drives home the ultimate point which i drew from the song that is everything will be okay the thing is i have only begun to skim the surface and i could do this for every song on this album all of them i will not but the point is this is an incredible album the kind of album where i would not question anyone choosing any track as their favorite and it is become such a deeply ingrained personal album for me but i am confident that everyone with an interest in rock music can find something here i wonder if i will see another album like this released in my lifetime who knows do they make them like this anymore,5.00,5434
emi shows how great it is at marketing it is not bad but it is not the greatest album ever made either i can see why it people love it so much the electronics used in a time when there was a big rebellion against it britpop and grunge and they were used to make texture and atmosphere and not to get a cheap synth pop hit how much credit can radiohead take from that a lot of it has to do with the improvements of synths and effects pedals etc from the 80s and nigel godrichs production put together the acoustic electroacoustic and electronic experiments into a seamless statement plus pop songwriting was at the core however thom yorkes vocals no thanks i will say i do prefer this album to any other rock album in the top 100 that is for sure,3.00,745
i had read soo many reviews for this before i even listened to it it was popping up everywhere and even one of my favourite rappers made an ill reference to itsee do not see us by the roots i eventually listened when i decided to venture into rock music and i was blown away just listen to it not much i can say really,5.00,318
much as i love everything that came after this is still my favourite radiohead album where they still took the songwriting as seriously as the sound it just has that classic album feel of capturing the time in which it was recorded and but also feels strangley timeless,5.00,269
i just cannot stand situation that this masterpiece is acclaimed as the best album of all time seriously guys get your ears out of shitholes karma police is the most pretentious thing i have ever heard,2.00,201
everyone of these songs has made a major impact on my life over the years the beatles front to back are the better group but this is the greatest record of all time either way you turn i will be there to open up your soul,0.50,221
fully inflated nowhere near as good as advertised,4.00,49
sometimes there comes something that one way or another changes the way we see something be it a movie a game a series anything other times said event does not just change our view on certain things it changes our view about everything sometimes said event can last for a little while other times it is something that we shall remember for the rest of our lives should we embrase it ok computer is the latter one to me it is an album that changed my view on everything about this world music specially it is an album that it simply has everything it is not as difficult to get into as many other album it is not a simple catchy listen it is intelligent it is atmospheric it is experimental it is touching it is disturbing it is funny it is not uber pretentious it is inspirational it is everything does it deserve to be number one on the site that is too subjective and too arguable and opininonaded and it is better to just not dwel on that but the answer is in my eyes clear my my rateyourmusic you have taste,5.00,1011
i can understand the appeal of this album i can enjoy it moderately hence my rating being above average i also do not have any strange hatred for this album or the band like so many do but this album has never been anything special to me in the end the problem boils down to the fact that i have no emotional attachment to this album i respect the fact that many find this album to be very emotional but it just does not do it for me radiohead in general has never really brought upon an emotional response for me,0.50,513
i will not listen to much after karma police besides no surprises and lucky i think the rest is pretty much filler the great songs are great but i think the rest are not as amazing i think the bends is much more consistent but still the best songs on here are the best they made ie paranoid android subterranean exit music and let down are some of the 4 best tracks in a row on any album update climbing up the walls is incredible and i do not know how i missed that for so long when i finally got it the song blew my mind still do not think the tourist is as good as street spirit but overall when this album is good there are not many bands that can do much better just noticed this album is at 1 beating out the beatles and pink floyd while i agree as far as the beatles except mayyybe abbey road and say this and dark side are about neck and neck and judging from the ratings it looks like they are,5.00,902
subterranean homesick alien is a personal favourite let down most radiohead fans favourite yes yes we have all heard about how radiohead is abhorrently unoriginal for lending beatles track sexy sadie musical idea for karma police but a mega foff to those guys this is better than sexy sadie erm fitter happier is a poem not a song rite electioneering when i go forwards you go backwards and somewhere we will meet when i go forwards you go backwards and somewhere we will meet hahaha climbing up the walls about madmen no surprises one of the poppiest radiohead songs with the spirit of a young teenager a personal favourite prefer the live version though while i do not think this is an intended concept album a term which the band hates being applied to ok computer and while the themes in the songs seem very varied when seen individually escapism the hypocrisy of politics insanity in the context of its times it makes sense a truly symbolic snapshot of the 2000s and the birth of stressful modern times before it happened ok computer 1 airbag 40 2 paranoid android 50 3 subterranean homesick alien 40 4 exit music for a film 35 5 let down 45 6 karma police 45 7 fitter happier  8 electioneering 375 9 climbing up the walls 35 10 no surprises 45 11 lucky 45 12 the tourist 35 overall 387 strangely low probably because of the tourists length impression 45 colossal album cover dated or snapshotlike 35,4.50,1405
yes i am another radiohead fanboy so if you do not want to read another person gush about this record it is best you just move on the question i get from my friends and a few anonymous online individuals is why or why this record as if there is a simple objective response that could answer it maybe at the time of its release in 1997 i was simply bored of music and i was craving something different and when i first heard paranoid android and saw the provocative video i let out a wow this is different cry and latched onto the radiohead sound all i know is i listen to 95 of my music collection on shufflerandom play this cd i do not and cannot airbag is like foreplay to me with the bass line and the christmaslike bell sounds of the tambourine paranoid android then invests me into the record i start thinking in abstract visuals and then ride along with journey of tracks 3 to 6 with let down a perfect rebound to exit music after the break provided by fitter happier i get fed energy of electioneering and climbing up the walls and then get to wind down to the final three haunting songs i feel like i have been concentrating on something that one cannot possibly concentrate on i am left feeling like i had an ear and brain workout it is been 16 years and i do not go a month without taking this journey,5.00,1311
possibly the most overrated album of all time the praise heaped upon radiohead easily surpasses all of the undeserved acclaim the beatles get when it comes to hype versus actual talent i have still yet to hear anyone justify why this release is among the greatest of all time that said it is still a solid album though i prefer amnesiac,3.00,336
generally when i sit down to write a review i am pretty clear about the specific points i want to get across and i hope that at least some of the time i manage to inform or entertain fellow rymers in some small way or other the problem with an album like ok computer is that everything that needs to be written about this album has surely been committed to paper or pc screen already for once then i am prepared to beg steal or borrow when it comes to the preparation of this review so with apologies to iai here goes yes i am white yes i am middle class yes i was a student yes i have had my problems with women no i do not play guitar yes i have cut my hair in the last 6 months no i do not wear band tshirts and baggy trousers all the time no i do not dabble in recreational drugs yes i enjoy my pretensions of liking all genres of music and no ok computer is not an album that i can connect with in any meaningful way do not get me wrong i can appreciate that every note of this album has been laid down with immaculate care and attention by a band at the top of their game but it leaves me cold if this is music that describes the alienation of growing up in 1990s britain then maybe i spent too much of that decade living abroad but i think it has more to do with ok computer being a generational thing after all how many people twenty years younger than myself would be able to appreciate the importance of closer to me in my formative teen years in truth i was waiting throughout the first few tracks for some moment to hit me maybe some unforgettable hook or lyric i thought that moment had perhaps arrived on karma police when thom yorke suddenly breaks free and sings for a minute there i lost myself the irony was not lost on me soon after we are back in the atmospheric middle ground where this album largely resides as yorke himself states no alarms and no surprises please hooray for being a fortysomething and yes i do vote liberal democrat,3.50,1956
although it is time to realize that ok computer is not some kind of top music or even rock music this album has to reflect the greatness of a certain kind in some categories it may indeed be the greatest album of all time namely in poprock categories although many big words have been said about the breakthrough and progressiveness of this album it still belongs to the broadly understood poprock family indirectly like say postbop to bebop but definitely because on the one hand in a sense progressive treatments on the other still a verserefrainverserefrainbridgerefrain and basing on extremely neat but quite simple emotional climaxes that will be gripped by legions of recipients who will not be scared off by unusual sound and heavy for pop atmosphere and as radioheads popularity on the internet shows the popularity of their albums and concerts  it did not scare off a whole host of people this also explains the phenomenon of the album which is why it is so often an album winning the rankings to a certain extent it meets the expectations of the more ambitious audience of popular music rewarding the simplicity of the composition of almost all songs with interesting arrangements atmosphere and one more complex piece and on the other hand thanks to the song structure it does not discourage a typically pop listener with a little effort on his part giving him a feeling of communing with something out of this world a lot in the subject is explained by the local description of the alternative rock genre to which ok computer agrees alternative rock is a style of rock music that generally consists of typically pop rockbased song structures performed with a less commercial more underground sensibility this is exactly the approach taken by radiohead here and it has admittedly been brought to the championship the group made again impressive progress in just two years albeit with significant continuity with their previous achievement as already mentioned almost every track on ok computer is  as on the bends  a poprock song with a simple stanzachorus composition whose main task is to build and then erupt an emotional climax but that is only a third of the story artistic  progressive  alternative qualities are revealed in several fields above all in the original sound  arrangements and atmosphere two basic directions to follow if you want to create ambitious popular music and do not have significant compositional or improvisational predispositions  not many understood it before rh for example joy division cocteau twins or my bloody valentine and in the only more formally complex composition paranoid android the arrangements and the resulting sound are the result of eclectic inspiration between many inferior two as prominent as bitches brew and tren for the victims of hiroshima it is true that a person who reads about them before reading the album will be very disappointed because we are talking about one of the most outstanding musical achievements of the 20th century and the effect is very far from their size but apparently they did their job of course much more is the first inspiration  it is a bit different in each track but we can point to a very different approach to using guitars and even to drums boldness in using a wide variety of synthetic and acoustic sounds and weaving them at the right moments studio job well done the sound seems to spread out over a lot of space and finally the sonic qualities of yorkes vocal who on the first two albums was still a slightly interesting singer one thing i do not like is that the bass lines are far too deep in the mix especially as they are often very pretty either way it melts into a beautiful mass in fragments the so praised atmosphere of the album is present in all its glory only in some of the songs but let us say that they emanate with it on the remaining songs and we can call ok computer a work with a strong and original atmosphere of decadent neurosis melancholy loneliness pessimistic view of the future of alienation in the modern world which increasingly eliminates everything from life except work and hedonistic consumption anxiety about the development of technology this atmosphere led to the aforementioned sound as well as minor and dissonant harmonies skillfully melancholic melodies and yorkes vocal expression airbag a track rarely mentioned among radioheads greatest achievements in fact deserves a place among them through him the album imposes its neurotic melancholic atmosphere from the very beginning rhythmically and sonically hypnotizing drums varied and surrounding guitars giving a paranoid glow barely perceptible but beautifully enriching the texture of the bass and the fatalistic ecstatically depressive voice of yorke strongly resonating sound after all a great melody with nice chromatic treatments paranoid android is one of the bands best achievements and popular music in general not only because it hardly breaks the simple formula of a rock song it starts with one but the schizophrenic song is brutally interrupted by a furious storm of distorted sharp guitar riffs to go into a desperate emotional torn elegy and end with a second attack of aggression  three faces moderately matching each other here sensitively combined into a perfectly harmonizing whole it is also a piece of textural precision rarely found in rock impressive especially in the area of densely dotted guitars with beautiful and often dissonant melodies intelligent harmonies that build a very dark atmosphere it is a sonic gem presenting three different tonal faces the first being particularly impressive with a maze of guitars of various timbres a melotron and yorkes schizophrenic vocal after all it is a bomb of the atmosphere leaning from ok computer towards the bands next albums not so much neurotic and melancholic but simply fearful and depressive if you deny this status to the entire album you must at least agree that paranoid android is a masterpiece of popular music although in my opinion it is quite impressive even in general musical categories subterranean homesick alien returns to a closer airbag atmosphere of safer neuroticism and melancholy as well as to a simple songlike form however it is a fantastic piece firstly thanks to the strength of this atmosphere secondly thanks to the beautiful sound with the sounds of the guitar and keyboards freely spreading in space instilling a part of the cosmos in the atmosphere thirdly expressive vocal fourthly great melodies and fifthly thanks to the emotional climax in the chorus one of radioheads best the appetite at this point is huge but the descent is starting the first part of exit music seems to be just a pretext for a spectacular climax at the end although it is so successful that you forgive the simplicity and a bit too literal sadness of this long introduction the contrast between his silence and relative peace and the noise and emotional disintegration of the finale came out neatly in let down the band unnecessarily withdraws from neurosis and leaves nothing but melancholy spiced up with a little too much sweetness the structure of the song is really trivial still it comes out unscathed with captivating melodies sparkling sparkling guitar and electric piano sounds a neat blend of two vocal lines towards the end and  as always  yorkes endearing vocal climax karma police is running away towards conservative pop rock unfortunately even more still the number of advantages is considerable  successful breaking of electric guitars with fragments with only the piano nice melodies and finally a return to a more interesting sound with a sliding guitar in the lead role it is regrettable however that instead of clogging the album with such pleasant clichs the band decided not to develop the next one on the fitter happier list which is by all means a good idea although a bit too bold and too miniature it could beautifully consolidate the albums neurotic vibe in a more developed form but it does its job anyway quite detached from the core electioneering with its unbridled vigor seems to be yet another bomb of direct youthful emotions straight from the bends with this album being one of the strictest songs it has some of the most thrilling guitar riffs radiohead has ever delivered and the whole thing is also rhythmically catchy and full of super nice energy so here is the excuse for letting go of the programmatic atmosphere of the album climbing up the walls returns to neurosis and sadness and this is one of the sincere expressions of sadness on the album yorke with emotionally devastated vocals in great shape melodies with irresistible charm and finally a very skilful bolder than usual arrangement embracing the song with unobtrusive strings on the one hand and surreal electronic sounds on the other no surprises is the strongest leap into pop but it is pop with soul and nice emotions formally a banal thing maybe apart from a nice melody of the vocal line it conquers me with a neat treatment of a nervous breakdown under the mask of a blissful smile and  in contrast to the somewhat similar let down  at all despite its sweetness with an atmosphere that does not differ much from the core of the album a bit oneiric thanks to the use of bells the elegiac sadness in lucky is perhaps a bit too obvious but reasonably seasoned with anxiety and enriched with psychedelic guitars the chorus of this track is a model use of pathos the tourist is a perfectly hit closer the atmosphere of neurosis melancholy loneliness from the beginning of the album returns once again it is wonderful to listen to the exhausted yorke captivate sleepiness and lamentation melodies and the refrains especially the lengthened last one are indeed a small masterpiece of radioheads climaxes probably because they are involved in them not only vocals but also guitars and drums and besides they are not so much emotional as cathartic i used to consider this album to be insanely equal i do not believe it anymore although rh finally managed to record the album without a single nightmare indeed there is not even anything average here in fact only half of the songs live up to the promise that is made to the listener great arrangements and an intense atmosphere the other half in general does not completely separate from these qualities however it is considerably relaxed this is a great pity it is still a very impressive album besides insanely enjoyable and i do not like being dismissed from the false avantgarde sure a lot of people were seduced by him and not let go higher but it is probably just their fault but please consider how many people this album as a link between the mainstream and a more ambitious approach to music opened the gates to something more anyway i am to some extent one of them for these merits and for sentimental reasons perhaps i stretch my judgment a bit may they also

a big step forward musically and sonically if not particularly song wise from the bends the bands follow up ok computer is touted as the dark side of the moon of its generation and counted as one of the best albums ever made in music polls  what you actually hear is a band experimenting  with electronic textureswith nods to prog rock and eastern musics in the guitar sounds with atonal effects and vintage synths it says a lot for the bands natural melodicism that they manage to make the whole thing sound so appealing even though its far from commercial much of that of course is to do with yorkes vocals superbly recorded and performed from the droning guitars and squelchy synth sounds of airbag through the suite like paranoid android and the white album homage of karma police the record rarely loses its focus  its perfectly sequenced in a way records were in the old days let downs twinkling 12 strings and oppressive melancholy and luckys soaring stadium downer rock are 2 of the finest moments in the bands catalogue climbing up the walls doomy paranoia on the other hand would give tricky nightmares the bands confidence is quite staggering they know they are brilliant only the flat out rock of electioneering feels a little forced otherwise ok computer is one of those rare albums that fitted the times perfectly  capturing the hollow sadness at the core of our modern technology based materialistic driven existance perfectly and it catapulted the band to a new level of fame  not that they have played it safe there once  no siree ,4.50,1548
i guess i should write a little bit about this album since i placed it on the highest of the high on my top albums list the one inside my head mind you for the longest time there are moments when i tell myself that this is not as good as i really think it is honestly i do feel like the hype has brainwashed a lot of people but since i have limited myself to media and critical exposure for some time to give myself my own clear opinions i really do love this album a lot i still remember the first time i ever heard it the minute i heard the song lucky i was facinated enamoured etc etc that month i probably listened to this album every fucking day i do not know how i did it but i was just so obsessed i wanted to absorb every little note and soundwave coming out of my speakers everything was so layed out in front of me this album in my mind what i have always wanted musically but never had until this moment end pretentious rant this album still makes me feel this way now that i have moved on to a wider spectrum of music and not purely dadrock like when i first heard this album i truly understand it is role in the music world that it played when it first released ok computer is truly a brilliant piece of semicynical art that will always be a part of my life it is not my favorite album anymore but it is the one that started everything for me it gave me and my 12 year old self hope that there was modern art worth listening to maybe the youtube commenters on beatles songs should give this a listen and quit praising the beatles like they are demigods that little part in let down you know the one is still one of the most amazing things i have ever heard 55 for the rest of my life,5.00,1696
i started listening to radiohead because i stumbled upon the song subterranean homesick alien and i listended to that only because of the clever title a nod to dylans subterranean homesick blues i liked it enough to listen to it again but it did not really excite me that was probably 2 months ago i now recongize the brilliant song writing arragement production work that this song along with the rest of ok computer demonstrated i do not believe i am alone in saying it took several listenings before i actually loved ok computer perhaps this is mood music but i personally feel albums do not get much better than this it is not perfect no album is 55,5.00,653
this is not overrated but the five star rating is not for me it is a beautiful soundscape and a great gift to give to anyone who never heard it when it came out its a stupendous gift for young people there are many nonhipsters who have never heard of this release or at the very least simply do not listen to radiohead based on the only relative strength of their latest few releases if you have not heard it in awhile it is always good to throw this on and sit down and have a nice think,4.00,488
i have listened to this hundreds of times first i scored it with 45 stars because i got used to its sound but i had to change it today to 5 i absolutely love this album they are now tied with loveless i cannot decide which one is the best of the 90s,5.00,249
at first i did not like it but after a couple of listens i realized how amazing this album is not my favorite radiohead album still mindblowing 55,5.00,146
this is the first radiohead album i listened to and it led me deeper into their catalog once deeper into their catalog it led me to appreciate and seek out similar music that i never would have looked for without having heard radioheads albums for me this album is a perfect blend of pop and more experimental songs that flow well throughout the album a journey through a rigid cold modern existence,5.00,399
one of the most over rated bandsgroups of all time this is one of their better albumscds so much of their material sounds the same i guess it is considered cool to be a radiohead fan,2.50,182
most overrated album of all time but it has some good songs like no surprises  the tourist  and karma police good album but not the best,4.00,136
i think it is excessive that the recording remains in the first position of its year but that is the way things are clearly we are facing a basic pop music album you may like its cadence more or less its melancholy tone but it is wellborn the melodies are taken care of and it contains already anthological themes such as paranoid android or lucky perhaps the best work of one of the most overrated bands today,4.00,410
it is already reached number 1 well months ago and it is that formula that makes the person with the most votes beat the one with the most votes if they have fewer votes as is the case of abbey road which is significantly better rated but is it really that good the passage of time has made it clear to us that this movement somewhat unstructured and electronic with a somewhat melancholic voice has been the basis of the main trends of independent alternative rock groups it is not as electronic as we thought then but better but what happened to abbey road when i listen to the beatles masterpiece time passes quickly this does not happen with ok computer and it is not that i am an expert on the matter that is just what happens to me if i am doing something else abbey road always has my attention this does not happen with ok computer in some moments i even forget that i am hearing it have i invented a new way to value records however the disc is not bad at all,4.00,968
this is strange  i really cannot accept this album being the greatest of all time but at the same time i cannot give it less than 5 stars,5.00,137
this is an undeniably spectacular album certainly the dark side of the 90s generation like dark side this album manages to channel a simple melancholic vibe that seemingly serves as a commentary on existence as defined by the times dark side was steeped in the context of crass consumerism and the rise of the me generation ok computer is steeped in the rise of crass technologism and the rise of the look at me generation like dark side it is one of those albums you do not just listen to it is an album you experience the sonicry seems to take on an extra dimension and it as though it is being absorbed by all of your senses it is music that seeks out total immersion i will say ok computer does not really call for me personally as much as dark side still does ok computer seems to have just a bit of cold detachment to it and just is not quite as universal in feeling as dark side there is the other issue that radiohead for me kind of went off the rails after this album and rightly or wrongly it has sullied my desire to listen to anything radiohead even this marvelous album however that all aside objectively speaking there can be no doubt that this is a 5star album that deserves its place in rock history and esteem as of this writing it is 1 on rym just ahead of dark side i of course would flip the two but i can agree with it being in that neighborhood it honestly is probably the last great rock album that was ever written which honestly is quite a sad commentary on the state of rock music in the 21st century but that is a discussion for another place and time,5.00,1578
the top spot on rym of this album is what caught my attention and got me started listening to radiohead about nine months ago so i am approaching this album fifteen years after it was released this was not what i expected  it sounds a little like a more hip version of eighties marillion the first six songs on this are all great the album does get a little weak in the middle  fitter happier electioneering and climbing up the walls are not great and bring the album down just a bit if push came to shove i guess i would have to say i love the way this album ends  the last three songs are so amazingly good if you are thinking about getting this you need to realize this has more of a prog feel than the bends or their later albums so although it clearly fits in with their nineties work it is unique in radioheads catalogue i love the guitars on this  after this release radiohead would rarely use so much electric guitar in their music here you have two or three complementary guitar lines along with keyboards and bass and of course vocals and drums so it is a very complex sound the melodic content on this is just out of this world this is very depressing too which i also like,5.00,1184
when i come from school and i am really tired and want to relax with some musicthis one will be sure on my list,5.00,111
this is stuff personally i have to be in the mood to listen to but once i am and get into it this is actually pretty good but do i understand the hate for a band like thisabsolutely,3.00,181
i forgot about mainstream rock altogether and then this happened,0.50,64
what more to say if you have given ok computer your full attention with headphones in the dark and still not been lifted in some way by the experience then you are doing it wrong,4.50,178
the greatest album of all time people who say this is overrated just do not understand it or have not listened to it enough fitter happier bad no it most certainly is not you are listening to it wrong listen to it again but this time invert the lyrics so if he says i am fitter happier he is really saying i am not fitter and i am sad i could go on but this album should speak for itself,5.00,387
simply spectacular one of the greatests ever made,5.00,49
unlike kid abc this has songs and wellarranged ones at that but the lyrics were written by a sixthform serial masturbator with no connection to anything worthwhile remember that old oscar wilde quote about the definition of a cynic he knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing the author of these songs in both content and delivery shows that he not only knows the value of nothing but he does not know the cost either utterly divorced from anything that music is meant for which is odd given some of the genuinely inspired chord movements and indicative of a schizophrenic songwriting partnership that and pushing the old nwo transhuman and alien agendas  thanks guys yeah we know that there are ufos around but let us not go jumping to any alien conclusions okay and stop whining and stop winking,2.50,810
the better half of the tracklist is on a completely different level compared to the lesser half but the overall theme of the album keeps those songs relevant  airbag let down,3.50,174
the bends was very good but did not even come close to preparing us for the record that followed here you have an excursion into depth this is an album that once you hear it you will never forget it lyrically it is absolutely magnificent thom yorkes pessimistic pondering is a big part of the effect of ok computer however the songwriting is second to none paranoid android is hands down the best song ever written pacechanging unforgettable and just completely emotionally overwhelming that is how most of the album works it just overwhelms with feelings that once you are done with it you will not know what hit you at times it is ghostly exit music riffy airbag dreamy let down or just plain catchy karma police there are so many different colors to it but you will still struggle to find a more consistent recording this album is just completely outstanding you will rarely have such a lifechanging chilling listen it is completely perfect and beautiful in every way quite possibly the best album ever made,5.00,1010
a specific plate ocean genre but it has its own atmosphere and stands out above the masses of secondary releases i do not know what else i could write about this album it is just good experimental even but not boring goahead but not by force however i do not come back to it too often sometimes i listen to selected pieces to pass the time for example on the bus or during a break at school,3.50,390
not much to say about this record it changed my life when i turned 19 and probably many others lives an emotional tearjerking piece of art recommended for people who is having an identity crisis the depressives or simply the ones who love music lifechanging guaranteed,5.00,268
perfection simple as that my personal favorite tracks are exit music no surprises and subterranean homesick alien this is one of those albums you have to listen too before you die,5.00,179
the best album in the history of mankind new paragraph well not counting the obvious mozart requiem,5.00,99
from the album booklet jump out of bed as soon as you hear the alarm clock you may also find it useful spending five minutes each morning saying to yourself every day in every way i am getting better and better perhaps it is a good idea to start a new day with the right frame of mind,3.50,284
i have tried oh how i have tried to understand why this album receives so much praise but i have to admit i just do not get it i have owned the album since the week it came out back in the late 90s and i have given it chance after chance to sink into my apparently thick skull to no avail i hate it i feel like i am the last one to see the hidden picture in one of those secret eye pictures i enjoy the album that is not the issue the problem is that i do not get its supposed greatness and its placement as one of the greatest albums of all time i just do not see it that being said i will say that i think this is a good album the standout tracks are airbag paranoid android and one of radioheads greatest songs karma police i will continue to try to find out what i am missing i guess but music should not be this hard to enjoy until then i find this to be a 35 album,3.50,870
it seems that radiohead really wanted to say something important with this album they almost do but betray their true desire to say everything,3.50,142
as one has been in this world for years it is difficult for pure serendipity paranoid android or deja vu karma police and exit music for a film together with a handful of totally inconsequential songs to impress me  albeit a little and as one tries to be objective even if they criticize among many other things the great swindle of the critics of the last two decades both decades by the way very weak in the musical aspect and the eternal borreguismo of the people  i will not say that this is a shit album or anything like that i can only say that it is perhaps the most ridiculously overrated album of all time and it is just that things have to be bad enough for an album as medium as the one i am dealing with right now to be extolled to nausea bad times,3.00,760
its almost heresy to write that this is overrated album from overrated band but this is how i always feel about every rh album i frankly like these guys but just as typical british band which had its momentum with creep their second album should be at piedestal of top british bands of their time actually since then they slowed down made more fuss and cloudy feedbacks but nothing that you would have been heard anywhere else karma police from particular album is an awesome song with fantastic atmosphere paranoid android is okay but the rest sorry sorry but its boring its very hard to compose structured songs slow noisy whispering feedbacked because to make it fantastic you just need to have fantastic normal song behind and this is with all honesty the area where the radiohead lacks most of the times compare it with jesus and mary chain first albums  almost same structure of every song but these were almost beatlesquality songs behind this is what makes a difference between top and overrated band,2.00,1008
rock surpasses itself songs with an infinite emotional visual tell of a paranoid humanity a prisoner of technology unable to slow down epochal pure art,5.00,151
a notbad pop album that got blown out of proportion in all honesty radiohead strikes me as a band that placed too much attention to production techniques as opposed to actual music average people are too often being mesmerized by the special effects of ok computer but if you were to remove these computergenerated sound effects you would see that there is really not much to the album the album opens with air bag it starts with a computerprocessed guitar droning made to sound futuristic in a clich sort of way but it ends up being a good song though it then proceeds into paranoid android probably the masterpiece of the whole album with the exception of a few flaws the rain down on me ending segment of the song is touching but it sounds a little conceited subterranean homesick alien is probably my favorite of the album its fascinating with its lightshow display of sounds it really captures that desire in all of us to be taken away from this boring world we live in and explore extraordinary areas of the universe lightyears away from here but even still it is all studio trickery if you were to disregard how distorted the sound is and examine the melodic structure of the song you would see there is almost nothing to it radiohead always emphasized the effect of the sound over musical content with the mournful exit music we find radiohead burying its nails deep into our subconscious anybody who has had a bastard father that they could not bare to live with can relate to this song let down was a nice song with its influence of the byrds jangle pop however the segment of computerized bleeps bloops and blops just sounds embarrassing to me karma police has a very strong melodic piano progression even if it is sort of a ripoff of sexy satie this ends up being the last good song on the album it is all downhill after this after listening to songs like electioneering or no surprises you are left wondering what the hell happened to this album similar to the album ten by pearl jam the first half of the album is great but the second half is rather unsubstantial in fairness ok computer is a decent album even if it was for the most part a showcase of computergenerated effects an emphasis on the emotional effect of sound instead of musical quality it is at least worth checking out i still enjoy listening to it every now and then but there are far more significant albums coming out of the 90s such as loveless by my bloody valentine spiderland by slint and well oiled by hash jar tempo i would consider those albums to be the essential masterpieces of that decade and were created by artists who are much more deserving of the word innovative than radiohead was,0.50,2680
this is for those who went through a phase of teenageor otherwise angst it sort of touches that confusion that comes with growing up and trying to understand the world you can hear an almost solemn misery in thoms voice best radiohead album of all time obviously whether it is the best album differs from person to person,5.00,321
definitely not the greatest album of all time this is a pretty good album for the most part but absurdly overrated i can think of aboutoh i do not knowlike 1000 albums that are better more interesting and feature musicians who are more talented on their respective instruments than these guys i mean cmon there are that many people who really think this is better than hendrixs electric ladyland the white album the stones let it bleed yess close to the edge floyds wish you were here and animals genesis the lamb lies down on broadway roxy musics for your pleasure king crimsons red van der graaf generators still life santanas caravanserai the cult s love zeppelins physical graffitti bob dylans desire or blood on the tracks the doors st the who is quadrophenia faith no mores angel dust traffics low spark of high heeled boys grateful dead terrapin station miles davis on the corner or tribute to jack johnsonetcetcetcreally once again ok computer is pretty good and one of the best albums of the 90s but very very overrated overall,4.00,1036
it took me a few listens for me to appreciate it first i knew the singles karma police and no surprises then i started enjoying the ballads let down lucky then the hard rockers airbag electioneering subterrean homesick alien then finally i started really enjoying the more unusual stuff paranoid android exit music the turist now i realize that the album is composed of some of my favorite songs and the only one which i do not enjoy is of course filter happier it is listenable though can be funny too the album simply archiever in so many ways but more importantly it sounds fresh and really enjoyable the band is pretty much at their top performance here i had a bit of an issue with the vocals in the last release but here they are just perfect and the guitar does some pretty unique stuff without never compromising the enjoyability what more can i say it is simply great song after great song and the closest i have seen to a perfect album the fact that it lasts for 50 minutes and feels like a short album is another proof of its great value,5.00,1048
definition of the western world,5.00,31
incredible album every song is perfect and amazing thom yorkes vocals are excellent in this classic album without a doubt one of the best albums of all time if not the best fav songs exit music let down overral rating 55 brownthoughts goat albums,5.00,246
i think not i like radiohead but this is in no way even close to the greatest album of all time this is not even the best in their own discography karma police is lazily written but lyrically expressive which  no quality control and does not bring anything to the table that bob dylan did not bring already they get points for including their honest work on here as well subterranean homesick alien etc and intersperse it with paranoid android no surprises karma police see where i am going here half of it is indeed great material but to raise an album up so high when more than half of it is completely unoriginal i must assume that most people here that rated it have little or biased musical taste or simply made an account just to uprate i mean better than in rainbows on that album they at least collided their sonic subtleties with their poppy hooks within each song instead spread separately across the track list in summary i like this album a lot but is this the best come on do you really think that,3.50,1010
i have sat on this album for years it still does not do much for me i guess i am just writing something now because it is one of my moms most recent obsessions along with that snow patrol song run oh well i like subterranean homesick alien,2.50,239
this is a perfect album because i like rock this album is nourished by all the good that music has been since it was known it uses various elements amazingly mixed in a great moment for music which makes it timeless i think the exit musiclet downkarma police string is supreme nothing can match it another segudilla is the great no surprisesluckya tourist already outright when the album enters its final art rock phase and another string is the experimental airbagparanoid android with which it starts a very futuristic sound anthemics and unbalancing it is like a wall that the listener must overcome if he wants to get into this album that is perfect clumbing up the wall is another huge barrier much higher than the first one i mentioned it is overwhelming boisterous cavernous drives any listener crazy but it is ideal if you have been listening to it since the first song the general thing is that anyone gives her a skip and that she may be the last to be discovered on this album strange that the fantastic polyethylene has not entered or in its other case palo alto in the place of the easily dismissable electioneering that despite being above average for any album with great solo and unbridled orchestration which in fact enlivens theok computer in a disjointed phase with fitter happier after the great karma police it would have been 10 wow and where they left lift they could also have included it although logically it would not fit on this album because it has a base the bends great radioheads are already top n1 and with other albums from the 2000s in the top ten,5.00,1582
who are the radio heads why have they told their computer it is ok where are the booty songs i do not get it no stars,5.00,117
absolutely incredible album the bends may have some better singles but as an album ok computer goes everywhere you could want it too if you say its a bit depressing then i think you should go listen to some generic shit pop music outstanding album in every way,5.00,260
comparing ok computer with any other album is like comparing a huge aquarium full of life with a flat singlecolored wall of concret radiohead managed to transform the chaos and dispair of modern life in beauty and poetry,5.00,220
what makes this album special is that dates back in the late 90s when it still was this fever of the cool britania thing britpop was the most famous genre inwhen this album came on in the markets it wasso strange to find an album by a british group talking about modern problems isolationanxietydepressionetc the music this is kind of a loose concept albumwath makes the album more interesting with airbag it is kind of a protokid a thing because of it is electronic thing that was going to be the principal sound of their next albumwith paranoid android android it is like mmmma strange distorted agressive version of queens bohemian rhaspody or beatles happiness is a warm gun but this is a great studio achivement because it is 3 songs combined in one and make a song of this type is really a big problem other great thing is the guitars making a great partnership each other making the suspense and tension that is in the songwith subterranean homesick alienit is like scape song from the whole albums sound the theremin gives a space kind of thingwell it is just thing to put close atention to the album regarding it is sound resuming all because i do not like to write so much about something i do not think anyone will read the music fells like desesperating depressing thing but it has it is little escapes like withsubterranean homesick alienelectioneeringthe tourist the lyrics it is no susprise that lyrics made some important work in the album because it falls away from the british music scene of 90s consisting about this lyrics talking about modern problems and at the time maybe the album had nothing little special on the themes of their songs but in retrospective if we see how society it is today is the problems cliuwe face in the hard life of people who work in this society with problems in the goverment our own health incluiding mental health like with the problems of anorexia that i think the track fitter happier also kind of deals in the song also the problems with todays technology etcpart of what i can call the legacy of this album it is the fact that deals with many modern problemsproblems that are more present today than the year that the album was released in conclusionit is the perfect soundtrack of the todays problems of sciety and what yesterdays was from back then and musically speaking this album it is practically responsible of todays alternative music scene that is in the world so many artists in the world have said about the influence they had in present music and in the music buisness itself it is this what makes the modern alternative music what it is now also it is responsible for exterminate britpop and make it more melancholic postbritpop,5.00,2698
this album restored the faith in the album as art since 1970s do not get me wrong there were many great albums released in the 80s as well but this one is the only modern abum that can touch the old greats every song is constructed gorgeously as close to a perfect album as you can get the album does not miss a single beat even fitter happier has it is place as a sociological statement in this album it embodies the attitude of the 90s and 2000s in regards to the depression anxiety and apathy of the last 2 decades a masterpiece,5.00,531
no best album of all time would have fitter happier on it,3.00,57
for a while there was sort of a dialectical progression of radiohead albums up until kid a each album by the group was both a fulfillment of the last album and a departure from it displaying a consistent progression towards greater experimentation with nonrock styles of music this is still distinctly a rock album unlike the nighunclassifiable atmospheric experimentation of kid a however it is also the first album that displays the sound now associated with the group there were albums by radiohead before it but this was the first radiohead album aside from its significance as a turning point in radioheads sound it is musically amazing and my favorite radiohead album the main instrument as with their previous two albums is the guitar which conjures up an admirable range of tones from the simple somber acoustic strumming of exit music to the distorted aggression of paranoid android and the clean chiming lyricism of let down however the often guitaroriented sound is augmented with a wide variety of melodies and textures ranging from strings and glockenspiel  to cut up processed drum loops and electronic effects the songwriting itself is brilliant varying sharply in mood while consistently conveying the alienation of modern consumer society  this album deals with sociopolitical topics to a greater extent then probably any other radiohead album barring hail to the thief ultimately this is one of my favorite albums of all time i could write an entire essay perhaps a book about it but in brief i would say that it is an unparalleled musical experience and perhaps the best rock album i have ever heard i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates emotionally powerful politically aware music with a wide variety of guitar textures and an experimental touch,5.00,1775
do i really need to write something about this piece of art they gave us back in 1997they let their music speak for themselvesopen your ears and just listen one of the best albums of all timeperiod,5.00,197
i have these friends all male who get drunk and then sit around and listen to ok computer it is the definitive bro album after slints spiderland they like airbag because they like waiting for paranoid android when i asked why they do not skip it one of them explained it is like holding in a shit for a few minutes to make it feel better when it finally comes out what is the part with the weird digital voice they usually pass out there and i walk home annoyed but some of them stay awake until no surprises,4.50,508
kid a is the better record in my opinion but i will never stop loving this album or this band overrated sure but who gives a crap whenever i come back to this i think to myself this is it this will be the listen that will ruin the album forever because you will realize how unimpressive it is how wrong i am,4.00,307
this is my favorite album of all time this album changed my from blink 182 fan into a fan of real music,5.00,103
i have acquired a taste for radiohead over the last few years and while i appreciate them as innovative and uniquethis is the most highly rated album ever a little historical perspective is needed i think it might be one of the best albums released in the last 20 years and it might be a top 50 candidate but better than dark side of the moon and abbey road please,0.50,364
when so many critics put this album in their top 5 for the past 20 years its probably best to listen to them one thing you can guarantee with a radiohead album is a different and unique sound to any of their other releases the lyrics of ok computer are pure poetry the like of which i had never heard before the sounds are raw and unrestrained belying the culture and intelligence in the accompanying words,5.00,406
in the past i have taken out my anger towards this album being overrated come on 1 overall on the album itself but after listening to it today i realized it is too good to be blamed for its hype i understand why so many people consider it the greatest thing ever it is the crowning achievement of the indie genre and the song body here is incredible paranoid android and karma police are the headliners but the electioneering and airbag are just as good this still is not the greatest album of all time but i have developed a newfound respect for it rating changed from 40 to 45 on 72012 this whole review explains why favorite tracks airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police electioneering climbing up the walls no surprises the tourist,4.50,792
while i remember loving this one upon first listen i have to say the fact that it tops the chart as best album on this site has made me revaluate it certainly there are great things going on in songs like no surprises and airbag but when taken in as a whole the album seems somewhat over valued i can see it is importance not only in radioheads career but also that of the history of the pop album but i think this just of those albums that the intellectuals like to call masterpieces again it certainly has a powerful hold but after a whilenot so much,4.00,552
cannot wait for the singer to change his voice he must be approaching 14 now,2.00,76
this album will bore you their lyrics are so dry and unappealing but their music saves them the album showcased their guitar skills and music ability,4.50,149
1airbag very good but overrated song 910 2paranoid android flawless song when i first listened it reminded me of bohemian rhapsody every second is gorgeous 1010 3subterranean homesick alien at first i nearly hate this track because i found nothing special later i got it artistic guitar work and atmospheric synth melodies great 910 4exit music very simple song just a guitar playing the same thing for 4 minutes and vocals despite this vocalsvocal melodies are perfect very impressive 9510 5let down alternative rock should be done this way great track 910 6karma police weird lyrics great piano melody and creative vocal melodies strange synths at the end is great excellent song 9510 7fitter happier na 8electioneering worst track but very entertaining some brit pop influences 7510 9climbing up the walls one of the best tracks of the band very atmospheric very psychedelic simple but superb 1010 10no surprises one of my favourite tracks with climbing up the walls and paranoid android in this album just like it simple but superb 9510 11lucky pink floyd guitars on the chorus make this song better very good song 8510 12the tourist one of the two tracks i did not get at first with subterranean homesick alien now i love it 9510 overall 92  masterpiece the thing is the best album of all time cannot be selected i mean which genre how but this is surely one of the best the ones who do not like the band should accept that they have the talent and creativity,5.00,1464
this is an incredible album the bends was really great but it did not push any boundaries ok computer is an extraordinary journey and every song works perfectly from the crazy experimental interlude fitter happier to the absolutely mind blowing paranoid android there are very few conventional songs with simply a verse chorus verse chorus formation they all build up change in tone there is optimism and despair nothing is boring and everything is exciting in lucky the lyrics are full of hope but the music tells an entirely different story there is something interesting to say about every song some of the highlights that incredible crescendo in exit music for a film thom yorke singing over himself in both paranoid android and let down the lyrics in karma police and the psychodelic ending the equally psychodelic uncontrolled sounding climbing up the walls and finally just the sheer beauty of no surprises,5.00,913
among the best albums i have heard in my life it is perfect no wonder it is in first place,5.00,90
first thing radiohead is not my thing i have to admit it and differently to most people i have had a long term lovehate story with ok computer mostly hate for ten years i have not been able to click into this record i have always known that there is something unique and unusual there but i was unable to honestly like it it was sometime in 2010 that i got to understand ok computer it is pretentious ambitious overdramatic many times but in the end it works you get caught in this atmosphere thom yorke and his band prepared for the record a little rock a little psychedelic a few drops of pink floyd and you get the ok computer texture not the best record in music history but my best late discovery and no doubt the one that took me most time,4.50,745
my personal favorite radiohead album with some great lyrics and the vocals with amazing instrumentals my fav track would be electionering,5.00,137
while i do not personally agree that this is the 1 overall album of all time i cannot give it any less than 5 stars because it is truly magnificent listen and decide for yourself people,5.00,185
35 it is a good album do not get me wrong at times great even it is rated highly though because it is an artistic album that can appeal to many different people who can appreciate artistic qualities of many different genres in essence this is an album which has something for everyone for me there is paranoid android the most epic of all radiohead songs and a heavy contributor on why i started searching for the obscure diamond in the rough gems of artistic music subterranean homesick alien and electionering also rank up there as some of the top radiohead songs for me as well but i cannot fool myself into saying this is as good as the bends which i still prefer to ok computer now i may rediscover this album combining it with in rainbows  if you do not understand research the comparisons and synergy between these two albums i still have not yet combined these two albums yet in experimentation in which case a higher or lower rating may result from 10 years of planning a supposed perfect complement to which is already considered one of the greatest albums of all time i can already hear it now  nude and subterranean homesick aliens free and easy going style with 15 step the perfect transition with airbag and paranoid android,3.50,1238
this is the highest rated album on rym really really really i have given this album over 10 forced listens and granted while it is agonizing at first it got less painful the most i listened to it the problem is thom yourkes whiny singing voice that sounds like a cats being tortured and he sings like that on every track and does not mix it up making the entire album sound the same in that regard for those of you familiar with mellon collie and the infinite sadness a vastly superior album imagine if billy corgan sang the entire album like he did on here is no why or to forgive or bodies or stumbleine it would not sound nearly as good granted paranoid android is an outstanding song and karma police is good too but by the time you get to the latter you are just tired of that whiny singing the rest of the tracks kind of describe my feelings of the album let down is what i think this album is no surprises is what it gives you in the singing style and lucky is what you will be if you can make it through a listen without gouging you are ears out best tracks paranoid android and karma police worst tracks pretty much the rest overall proceed with caution listening to this album is like musical masochism,1.00,1212
what a piece of shit i could not even get through the whole thing this is a perfect example of enough people saying something is good and a bunch of other people following their lead radiohead is trash and this album is proof that they should stop making music,1.50,260
i really good album once i finally decided to give it a chance not the greatest album of all time by a long shot but still a creative alternative rock album thom yorkes voice grew on me alot at first i could not stand it my favorite song is let down its so beautifully depressing and the melody is very catchy,4.50,309
i thought it was fabulous you can smell the influence of cool jazz records particularly miles davis as well as art rock like velvet undergroundbowie it might just be the best album of the 90s  it is not easy to make something of the scope that radiohead peaks at on this disc most people think altrock is not very melodic but you can sense sg and the beatles on this paranoid android is just bohemian rhapsody modernized come on not to say that it is not amazing they are not just idiots with technology at their disposal you can hear really kickin stuff within say karma police like coltrane scales and gracenotes and stuff liek that i forgot fav songs it has to be a three way tie with android karma police and no surprises i also really like climbing up the walls lucky and the tourist though the closing four songs rreally do it for me i realize that now i am just rambling on so i would like to finish this by saying that it is nothing less than a cornerstone of my library and something that can set a bar for anyone putting out music today by the way this sounds a lot like dark side of the moon and although it is fantastic you shud lie down for awhile if you think this is the best album ever,5.00,1201
all i will say about ok computer is that its a magical experience once you realize that the magic is happening to you then is pretty much a thrill ride around your emotions thoughts and memories,5.00,194
i love the track after the tourist the best they should release their next album with songs just like that i bet people would buy it then i bet that people would rate it so highly that it would reach the top 100 on this site that was my initial review from march 10 2010 right now it is june 29 2011 325am est as i type this there is a good chance that whoever it is spending their time to read this knows next to nothing about me i appreciate you sticking around this long after such a lazy critique now onto the review my skepticism of radiohead began in 10th grade it was not so much the music rather the people that i knew who listened to them among them were two people that i despise to this day my scorn for one is barely justified but i digressi tend to hate the bands of a person that i dislike however radiohead was not just any band to place such hate upon want proof the 4chanquality review up top was just a review since i felt wrong giving this album  one of such high praise and love  a low rating even back then i knew that everything about this band would intrigue me if i just gave them a chance instead for the longest time i would only hear snippets of songs see an occasional video and just go on rants with friends about thom yorkes voice however i was lying to myself approaching two weeks ago i decided to give radiohead a real honesttogoodness listen i would like to thank oldguywithsticks92 bjrk they are like cousins musically and i love bjrk and of course pathmark for having the album among their assortment for a fine 7 deal a wise investment in retrospect during the purchasing process i was ashamed of what i was doing i was embarrassed here is an album that i said that i would never buy from a band whom i hated and yet here i am buying it i hid the disc in the cart upside down and between two other things just to disguise it once i came home i gave the album a listen i was doing a few things at once and even just left while the song was playing and to no surprise it did not stick that night i got no sleep for the first time ever instead i just laid down on the bed and played okc on the stereo an old ritual of mine that i recently revived even though i had gone the longest time in my life without sleep the music swept me through an onslaught of its sonic textures fragile falsetto vocals and consistent invention last one is a lie unlike many first time listeners i was well aware of the musicians that inspired radiohead i am even a fan of a good portion of the ones that really inspired this album namely dj shadow charles mingus etc much of this stuff was likely not as fresh to me as someone who was less versed in electronica and 90s underground music as snobbish as that sounds in general and yet the way this album uses atmosphere just seems to create memories for many of the listeners  yo 1997 was hell for me but this album makes it sound so beautiful that i do not even care about my silly personal history it is not so much the sounds rather the way that they were used in sharp contrast to much of the popular music at the time the smart ass talk ends here instead i have got unfiltered opinions this is a fine album i like every song i think the order is perfect even if you are not the biggest fan of the inclusion of fitter happier i appreciate how they added one song to try to break the barrage of classics and yet this defect goes unnoticed at least by me anyway paranoid android has the most ridiculous line ever karma police  paranoid android as a result climbing up the walls is my favourite song i spent a few minutes making fun of every song while i was still skeptical here is a few samples paranoid android  oooh they found a word that rhymed with paranoid exit music for a film  exit music it is only the 4th track are they saying to stop listening now let down  good thing i took their advice to leave when i did fitter happier  i used to be until i bought this no surprises  got that right i have heard this all before lucky  they are lucky i bought this piece of                     i understand the radiohead formula now radiohead tends to take at least back in the day the underground music of the time ie ambient idm etc and mix it with their own blend of the popular style at the time ie britpop the way that thom defiantly uses his falsetto in contrast to much of the more grizzly contemporaries reminded me quite a lot of curtis mayfield ironically hipsters favourite humour and yes i like the letter you the electronics on this album sound quite basic and dare i say it conventional luckily often times this is not the case they use the electronicastylings sparingly and even the most simple effects are pulled off quite convincingly refer to the climax of karma police this is where its successor kid a differs radiohead moved on from being a rock band with underground yearnings to a collective that attempted to alienate their listeners and become the underground kid a was a great impersonation and i mean that in the most endearing sense possible yet it came out in 2000 practically at the end of the classic electronica period that album features the band much more immersed in the music that they only sample here and yet i think i still prefer this album hear me out they are both splendid albums it is just that this album sounds almost like its own genre with its nottoocomplexyetcomplexenough lyrics and the music itself whereas kid a sounds more recognizable i seem to feel the opposite in that regard compared to many of the other reviews that i have read on here but if you were to listen to say aphex twin or autechre it would sound just as strange perhaps even more so considering they were making the music much earlier than 2000 point is i like this band and album very much and i am sorry for writing my initial review without properly listening by the way this is a rough draft open to the public,0.50,5897
let us try a little pitchfork thing right here p 1 airbag  100 2 paranoid android  100 3 subterranean homesick alien  100 4 exit music for a film  100 5 let down  100 6 karma policefitter happier  97 7 electioneering  89 8 climbing up the walls  98 9 no surprises  100 10 lucky  96 11 the tourist  96 average 978 rounds off to 98 98249 stars 49 stars rounds off to 5 stars stars 5 stars rating out of 10 98100 nearly perfect the first question that will come to ones mind when prematurely hearing their debut before it is predecessors is just how in the great blue sky they got from pablo honey to this in four years my innerhipster often inhibits me from giving such overrated albums the praise of a 5 star rating but the honest truth it there are rarely albums like this that are able to make you feel so depressed yet happy at the same time it really sounds crazy but it is true they were able to make an album that crosses the line of pure technical talent and blends almost perplexedly so the border that separates one emotion from another there is just something about that feeling of balance between happiness and sorrow that makes you feel grounded in a way that that is hard to describe without sounding insane it feels like looking at the world in a new light yet still realizing that there is a darkness that surrounds it all it is full of suspense but never sounds overdramatic the complete balance of experimentation and recognizable rock purist antics is most likely the reason its at the top here at rym its an album that is easy to love and hate at the same time just an album that is hard to feel too strongly either way since your too busy feeling the album itself an album that makes the definition of love and hate obsolete and makes the overcomplication of life seem trivial the exact second that jonny greenwoods guitar anxiously bends into airbag it is the record i could see the beatles making if they were still a creative force during the spawn of the digital age 12  hairy cut 45 a record that is filled with tracks so distinct that they cover up any minor flaws that may be present,4.50,2109
there is no real bias on the rym chart towards this album it deserves to be in the top 10 of best album ever every song from this album is great to be honest however if i had to choose between kid a and ok computer i would choose kid a simply because of its more atmospheric approach regardless great album 485,4.00,310
an alright record trying to ape pink floyd but being weird its whiny antics only really come through as intense on paranoid andriod an alright record but no diamond in the rough,2.50,177
all this reminds me of the image of a large corporate building a bank or whatever we could make a video of the album by fasttracking the employees who come out to chat and smoke their cigarettes ok computer is the cold world music that radiohead denounces they made an album of what they hate which is nothing but a lack of subtlety unable to give contrast to their ideal it is hard to really feel what ok computer has that is human,2.00,432
simply one of the best albums of all time there i have it fighting with the revolver and the white record of the beatles intense detailed an experience listening to it with headphones and extremely melodious perfect from start to finish,5.00,236
the second disc is really full of songs i can take or leave essential for any completist but not really fitting in with the rest of the album honestly i would rate that disc as 3 or 35 stars but this still contains the original ok computer album and that album is fucking amazing bumps it up to 45 as a whole,4.50,308
widely regarded as one of the best albums to come out of the 90s radioheads ok computer changed the band from a directionless incoherent mass of pity and self loathing to a band that strived to reach the excesses of its name and to elevate it to higher levels of credibility the album itself is excellent for breaking new ground in a rather stagnant rock crowd that was befalling the genre in the early and later part of the decade but in all honesty there is something about it that always leaves a stale taste in my mouth whenever i relisten to it it is a cold metallic almost lifeless construct of chords and chorus structures it just feels so artificial despite how progressive it actual is for an alternative rock album i always liken it to the dark side of the moon if it was made in the 90s and had its cynical edge turned up and a touch of 80s idmpunk like aesthetic thrown in that is what it feels like at least a groundbreaking album in one sense and a giant plodding fucking mess in another there is method to my madness though there is nothing quite like it and there will not be again but at the same time it sounds so tired a dull i justi cannot call it a classic it is dripping with the whole corporateself pittying malaise that the 90s seemed to bring out in everyone from musicians to hollywood it does it though in such a way that really does put you out of sorts at least for me anyway all i can really say is its an excellent album but for some reason i feel really uncomfortable listening to the whole thing it either depresses me or dulls me except no surprises that is the only song i actually can listen to without any null side effects for what it is its definitly a strong album but farfar from being as universally praised as it should be its melancholic and malaise ridden theme makes it an absolute drudge to get through playing the album through must have been one of the most depressing exsperiences i have ever had in that regard though it deserves some merrit track pics paranoid android subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film let down karma police no surprises,3.50,2105
i went from thinking ok computer was just pretty good to believing that it is a masterpiece after my most recent listen and i think it is because i finally understand what this album is about definition being defined by things that you never consider to have very much power over you but ultimately consume you and come to be your signature your politics your taste in music your neuroses your love lifeeverything that you think is a choice but is not not really it is 53 minutes of describing what happens when your facebook likes start controlling you and you begin to censor yourself at the behest of unknown enemies people you do not know but whose names you curse and snarl at with all your heart if only they would show themselves if only i think being the phrase that most describes the general tone of the album it kind of stuns me that this album is considered by so many people to be the greatest album of all time not because it is necessarily undeserving but because i had no idea so many people would be able to identify with this kind of selfloathing because if there is one thing ok computer shows it is that you can never hate anything more than that which is fully intangible,5.00,1192
when sitting down to review ok computer i really had to think about what i wanted to say everything that could ever be said about this album has been said a hundred thousand times more eloquently and effectively than i ever could but then again if you are affected by a piece of music more specifically a piece of art why should you not feel entitled to express your thoughts about that art the thing about ok computer it is such a seminal beast in the face of influential and emotional music that it is hard to sum up in a mere reviewso i am going to do my best there is a reason after all that this is the number one ranked album of all time on rate your musics chart without further ado i give you my thoughts i was born in the nineties right when radiohead was first becoming the huge international success that they would soon be known as and the legend that their name holds in the industry these days so yeah i was only about three years old when ok computer was released i was not there to hear it for the first time like so many others i was not there to slide the audio cassette of ok computer into my cars cassette player and slowly let my jaw drop as the tidal waves of ambience would so inevitably slide into the ears of millions and infect their musical tastesand their ideas of music as an art form with that being said i grew up enjoying a wide variety of music and slowly and assuredly my musical tastes expanded like so many others had i had my years of discovery where i stumbled ala the linkin park and disturbed days but eventually my ears sought to discover the world beyond the close encapsulated walls of radio rock musicthere was something so clich and worn out about much of the music that those stations played that i remember my father drumming along in the car to in my youth i was a child born of circumstanceand eventually i broke those boundaries and ventured far into the progressive fields of unconventional music i think the first step i made towards true selfdiscovery of my actual tastes and of creative artistic music was with nirvanas nevermind the moment i heard the rawness of those guitars and kurt cobains shattered screams and yellsi was captivated through the years i gained a foot in the vast array of independent and progressive music that i had so often seen heard or glanced it on the internet and like many circumstantial children of 90s radio rock i first heard of radiohead with their commercial success creep even though that song was far from what radiohead truly was and what i had no idea they would come to mean to me later in life i adored it then through the years i downloaded the bends kid a and ok computer initially because rolling stone magazine had named kid a as their album of the decadeyou see where i was coming from now with kid a i never truly understood the hype i thought it was yet another overrated overhyped overindulgent piece of drivel that this music industry seemed to deem art then again i was only thirteen at the time but unlike many a peer my age i was not one of the thirteen year olds obsessed with billboard bubblegum pop or marketed cheap sounding hiphop bands like nirvana pearl jam and smashing pumpkins helped begin the expansion of my tastes at an early age it actually was not until a couple of years ago that i was actually genuinely affected by ok computer i had enjoyed songs like karma police paranoid android and even no surprises to a certain extent this was before i relistened to the album to understand its revery and honor in the music world but upon relistening to the album for the first time since i downloaded it at the age of thirteen i noticed something the songs all did seem to carry a cohesive place together they all seemed to flow into one another each song was incredibly unique and distinct i was a little baffled that i had not noticed this before so after i listened to it for the first time out of sheer curiosity and infatuation i listened to the entire album immediately after having just finished doing so this timeit was like a lightbulb went off in my head as if i had some sort of sudden epiphany and realization of what i was actually listening to i think the moment that i had this sudden realization was when thom yorke goes into that beautiful falsetto on exit music for a film i realized it was the most beautiful piece of music i had ever heard i was giddy like a kid in a candy store with unlimited funds i felt like i could literally reach and out and touch this music physically with my hands it had such a body to it such a heart such a soul it was profound and completely enthralling for the remainder of that listen i was glued to my computer with my headphones a harbinger of lush noises and sounds bouncing around one another in some odd genius perfection i loved how the band worked together as a cohesive unit allowing each and every member to compliment one anotherallowing each and every member their own moments of recognition i loved the sweeping melodies and incredible arrangements immediately after i had finished listening i looked up the song lyrics for the album and discovered how deep and meaningful they all wereand how these song lyrics that inhabited each song on the album all tied together with one another on the album to create more or less a story of isolation and alienation of despondence and frustration of disintegration and decay of society but also of beauty romanticism and love of small facets of the world around after i had finished that listen of ok computer in deep analyzation and contemplation i understood it i got it the album the music and its deep intrinsic meanings hit me like a slug to the chest my world was changed ok computer in that moment was both life changing and life affirming it was everything that my tastes had been searching for in an album for so long but had not the slightest clueand it was right in front of my eyes for the longest time i discovered that ok computers inception was based upon a deepseated disinterest and disarray from the society around it it was an album that saw the future ahead of it and bore it like a cataclysmic foreshadowing of sound and destructive emotion it was kind of like reading fahrenheit 451 by ray bradbury for the first time it just kind of changes you it enlightens you it opens your eyes it shows you how frail and shallow almost everything around you is and how every day the society that everyone seemingly praises is collapsing upon its own self indulgence i guess i knew that before ok computer came into my life but then again everything just clicked thricefold in my brain after having fell in love with this incredible creation it was an album about insightful introspective and analytical people who could see the rampant problems in society hiding behind the thin veil of plastic smiles and radiant faces plastic surgery public transport the ideas of love in modern society the fakeness and shallow nature of much of everything around it the strive for progression in technology that was and is slowly tearing society apart on its own seems these are many of the themes of ok computer as society strives towards perfecting technology and using its beneficiaries to its advantage it fails to see itself losing its own fragile humanity in the centerfold and i think that that is much of what ok computer is about as a musical expression and a social statement it beckons for a return to real raw genuine emotional human qualities and aspects in society and then you have parts of the album that entail the inevitable descent into paranoia and even further to insanity due to the broken plastic she will that civilization brings on with its lucrative focus on advancement and security rather than maintaining actual human morals and characteristics i think the album has a lot of commentary on the idea of the android and more or less i believe radiohead placed the idea of an android or robot into the album so often because it is nothing less than the epitome of everyone that the society in which radiohead illustrates are headed to become i am paranoid but i am not an android is a perfect example and maybe with a bit of a subjective analyzation this is pointing towards the idea of human beings that are so obsessed with this dangerous idea of technology that they are slowly turning into these androids controlled by the technology they once sought to use to their benefit so maybe in the end the message of a song so epic as paranoid android is perhaps its better to be paranoid than to let oneself disintegrate and formulate in the cogs of societys machinery and let oneself become nothing less of an android the fragile humanity that radiohead so endearingly brings to life are a bunch that believe they are free with all of their advancements in civilization and technology and culture yet they fail to see that it is all a frail mask brought on by the society that is controlling their every action sound familiar well radiohead could see the future coming from a million miles away and so they set about using that very destructive technology that they despised so dearly to create this masterpiece that we have today they wanted to show their listeners and perhaps nonlisteners that the freedom everyone held so highly was a blight that was eversosteadily playing with fire even more than that i think that ok computer places a lot of emphasis on a sort of unsatisfied and insightful characterone who sees through all the thin plastic veils of indulgence i think that the character radiohead are trying to convey with their lyrical depth and their musical tone is someone deeply isolated and alienated from everything and everyone around he or she is a person that against the wishes of society chooses to maintain their humanity in a time of fleeting values and character this is where the album becomes not just a prophetic siren song for the future the ensuing 21st century at the time of this records release but also an incredibly relatable emotional personal and intimate summary of someone who feels deep dissatisfaction in their lives someone who is shattered and broken by their peers and by their environment someone who is desperately vying to break free from that place of anguish and i think that is an incredibly relatable theme for many people it is as if radiohead have this vision of a bruce springsteen born to run type character only set in a futuristic society in a different time and place i think the album has a lot of commentary on that of introverts and lonely people wideeyed emotionally unstable subway sitters and public transport junkies window starer types that embody much of that same isolation and despondence that radiohead seem to feel so intimately connected to it allows for almost any type of person to access this album and find an immediate connection with it even if they are unfamiliar or turned off by the thought of experimental rock layered with electronics it is an incredible motif and radiohead do an exceedingly brilliant job at conveying these messages with their even more brilliant musical production the music itself on ok computer should never be understated this is not just a beloved album because of its messages about society and its symptoms of isolation and hollowness there are many other albums that have themes and messages much like ok computer no what seemingly sets ok computer apart from the other experimental artsy alternative groups in the genre is their masterful attention to detail when it comes to their music and sounds radiohead are a band that are constantly evolving a band that gets off to the thought of reinvention and challenging their fan base and with that their entire discography is a constant shift in sounds tones ideas and experimenting with their debut pablo honey they were met with very mediocre critical acclaim had they not strived for more and probed their innergenius then we might be looking back at a band famous for its onehitwonder but instead of simply settling for second rate radiohead went on to produce the bends one of the best guitar rock and alternativecentric albums of the nineties with that album they blew heads away critics and fans alike were awe inspired that such a mundane band could go on to craft such a fantastic record but they did but even after that radiohead were not satisfied with sticking to one definitive sound and in a shallow way capitalizing upon it like so many other derivative bands have done instead they understood that to keep their music fresh to keep their music original and to become the influential groundbreaking centerpiece of the music world that they are today they knew that they had to explore new ideas of reinvention and progression taking cues from other critically acclaimed artists the beatles david bowie pink floyd dj shadow can etc who had also understood that reinvention and unconventional deviations from the norm are key to progression and originality in music the early ideas for their masterpiece and eventually the worlds masterpiece began so with ok computer an album that appeared at the helm of the nineties a decade already ruled in original experimental music all of the pieces lined up in perfect symmetry for once almost as if they were to set to fall into such a circumstance with all of these frustrations and angers all of these feelings of isolation and despondence from this slowly dwindling society they created an album that would go down in history as legend because of all of that existential angst and crisis thom yorkes howling vocals and beautiful range showcase the albums voice it is a voice of desperation and disappointment but also a voice drenched in fear and uncertainty of what the future was set to hold with all of these emotions and all of this artistic vision thom yorke perfectly inclines with the beautiful instrumentation at hand speaking of the beautiful instrumentation that may just be the albums defining characteristic because behind all of its deep intellectual and introspective themes and ideas behind all of its layers and cacaphonies there is one thing that ok computer is heralded for more than anything else and that is its incredible influence on music as a whole perhaps an album that was released perfectly for its place in the genre it came trodding along right as britpop was coming to its mighty end and bands like pulp oasis and blur were not producing the same quality records that they once had it came upon in a time of great musical change both in stylistic approach and in purpose as it was released in 1997 the musicality that shines through on ok computer was like nothing anyone in the music world had ever heard nor had dreamed could ever work together in an album the boys who had once released the infamous creep song had no less than redefined a genre of music listeners and music creators in that same decade even today ok computers influence can be seen far and wide in the industry bands like coldplay keane and muse owe the entirety of their sound to radiohead believe it or not back in the day alternative music did not automatically include the use of electronics and synths this is mainly due to the fact that radiohead had a vision of a different alternative music landscape and so with ok computer they saw their biggest departure from the days of the guitar drums bass repeat cycle and while that cycle in alternative and rock music is timeless and has always been seminal and most likely always will be radioheads sheer inventive force and insightful originality in their use of electronics working with those classic instruments was spellbinding and aweinspiring for the music world little things like this all accumulate to make ok computer the master class of musicianship that it is and that is without even going into deep detail about johnny greenwoods redefining use of the guitar in alternative music as he creates electronic and synth effects with his sharp skill and honed ability their sharp and forward thinking use of electronics in tandem with guitar rock helped light a fuse that had just been sparked before by other artists this fuse exploded and fully took flight in the 21st century in many ways there were a lot of great albums that take direct creative inspiration and design from ok computer but then again there is a pile brimming with deplorable ones as well nevertheless one cannot argue the influence that this album has had on modern music the funny thing isif asked about how they would be viewed in ten years time before the release of ok computer i am quite positive that radiohead would have never guessed nor could they foresee how encompassing and legendary their names would go down in music history lastly the songs themselves on ok computerwell they are something else are not they each and every last song is notable on its own merits as each one is entirely unique no one song sounds alike to any other song yet they all seem to flow into one another in perfect harmony like the soundtrack to the collapse of a futuristic societya society that radiohead brings to life that feels not too far off might i add with each and every song there is a hundred thousand different sounds and the attention to detail is easily conceivable when you play the record for the fourteenth time and are still noticing slight details in the songs from airbag the opener which is perhaps one of radioheads finest songs on its own merits the guitar that opens the album is simply jaw dropping and brings a smile to my face while the lyrics which are intern much darker by all means i am an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe a lot of radioheads music has certain ambiguous qualities to it aka kid a but there is just something about that line that makes me shiver every time i hear it it is almost like a siren song a mission statement for the album to me as if the music at hand is actually larger than life and is in place to provide a warning and a calling card all the same for the album i will not talk about each and every song in detail since this review is already much too long and i have already exhausted expunging my passion and love for this record to the grave but as the album continues you have paranoid android which is almost the song of the album it is a song that fully summarizes this album or at least i think so it has been called by many as radioheads stairway to heaven that is a statement that i completely disprove considering paranoid android is a song that is leagues ahead of anything led zeppelin ever created yet i can see why some people would believe that it has this incredible bending of tempos and structures throughout and all throughout i believe it details the slow descent into paranoia due to societys urgencies and pressures it is a song about how that paranoia may be more freeing than falling victim to the cycle of conformity that the androids are so inclined to tracks like exit music for a film which is apparently a song about romeo and juliet prove that radiohead has the ability to craft some of the most haunting music you will ever hear as it begins slowly and softly and foreshadows something much grimmer it pulls you in only to throw you for a loop towards the end where all hell breaks loose then you have let down this is my favorite track on the album it is just simply perfect it is one of the most beautiful expressions of disdain and despondence that i have ever heard as we hear thom serenade some of his most tasteful vocals ever over a story of transport motorways and tramlines and in the end how disappointing and depressing it all is then you have fan favorites such as karma police a haunting tale of censorship and restriction climbing up the walls a headfirst nosedive into a frighteningly realistic take on insanity no surprises a song about the dissatisfaction of day job life and its pressures as well as a testimony about the fake nature of many people in society due to the place of plastic surgery and cosmetics erasing our humanity and then of course there is fitter happier a song that i believe to be criminally underrated while yes it is not a fullfletched song like the others on the album i believe that the song plays its part perfectly voiced by an android like character that carries a very unsettling nature fitter happier is more or less a reading of day to day normalities and pressures of modern society and how they all more or less tie together to unhinge ones humanity and turn them into the very android that narrates this unsettling monologue overall i really cannot think of a short summary for ok computer because it is an album that deserves so much more than a few words it is an album that deserves to be praised more and more with every passing year as its sheer influence can be seen far and wide it is also an album that through all the beautiful instrumentation and innovative use of production has so very much to say about the modern world about society about the dangers of technology about humanity morality love censorship and further existentialist ideas and thoughts it is simply the most perfect album that i have ever heard i know that it is an undying clich to say this but ok computer is my favorite album of all time like so many other people but in this case this is a clich that works it is because this album is that damned good it is so well thought out well made and executed that for anyone to say that it is their favorite album ever madethey have ever right music owes a lot to radiohead and so do i as this album opened my eyes like i had never seen before to the bouquets of genres and styles of music at my access so just for that i would like to thank radioheadif not for anything else to begin with no one ever anticipated that in the late nineties the guys who put out creep would go on to produce one of the most widely regarded and critically acclaimed albums ever createdbut they did i do not know if they will ever top it but who knows it just goes to show that the best things in life truly are not predictable,5.00,22075
overrated but still a really strong album still on repeat listens it just is not quite up there with the bends but that is just my opinion fitter happier electioneering and climbing up the walls give it a slight sag in the middle still when it was released it completely blew my mind perhaps in that light i should have it as a 5 star so on average track rating  4 star but overall experience  5 star,4.00,400
given this is the top rated record on this site i decided to try it again maybe it is me and i am just missing something i listened to it carefully three times and my conclusion still stands this is just a meh album i really do not see what the fuss is all about and i still think that yorkes vocals are irritating,3.00,314
hey b if someone had told me that one day i would have fun listening to the agony of a guy buried alive,4.50,103
for years i saw this album as the record of the 90s now it seems to me a little overrated it is a good record but not that good i mean like the velvet underground  nico thom yorke as lou reedno my friends not even close,3.50,219
it is indeed strange that the album is no 1 in the overall ranking but it is a successful radiohead album nonetheless certainly their best songs like karma police or paranoid android are classics electioneering and no suprises are not to be overlooked either indeed the strange thing is that the album is the first place in the overall ranking but nonetheless it is a good radiohead album certainly their best cuts such as karma police and paranoid android is a classic you can not miss it electioneering or no suprises,4.00,519
how is this album ranked number 1 of all time its probably top 5 albums of the 90s id put 2 rage against the machine albums ahead of this one but i gave this a lower rating than it deserves i am just evening it out for the better deserving beatles albums i think the beatles deserve at least the first 3 spots anyways paranoid android and karma police are the obvious classics electioneering is probably my favorite of the album hey radiohead fans you can start listening to sonic youth now,3.00,490
extraordinary record a monument from the 90s soundtrack of modern life alienation and discomfort in the form of music,5.00,117
the most popular album ever not just is this the most popular album on rym but it is the one that is always coming on top of tvradiomagazine polls why obviously a lot of people ask themselves the same question whether they are big radiohead fans or not i am not a big radiohead fan but i do not rate this as really shit compared to their other stuff which is where i feel i stand out in fact i would say this is average or so one of the problems i have with it is how much i have listened to it i put it onto my mp3 player and pc years ago when i only had a few thousand songs and the tracks came up on shuffle so often i really could not help but sicken myself of it most music probably would become a bit dull after so many listens although certainly not all and i can think of a good number of records i had at that time which i never became bored with and still hold as very dear to me in other words not being sick of this album would not increase my rating i have been as objective as possible here tracks like paranoid android exit music and karma police regardless of what i have just said will probably never bore me but not much else has such resistance to overlistening i suppose the lesson you can take from ok computer is that it shows you the bad and the good of what radiohead are there are some really beautiful moments in the aforementioned tracks but there are also some really dull dreary moments of course even in the best moments it is pretty easy to become more than a little melancholic exit music is about the worst for this i cannot listen to it without feeling my soul being torn apart just a little fact i have never listened to this album in the correct order i put it onto my computer years ago the cd is my fathers but for some reason it ended up in m4a format and when i converted to mp3 i had lost the encoding on the files thus the track numbers were all set as 1 i could of course have sorted it but i am really not that anal i do not assume order would affect my rating although i know radiohead are the kind of band who probably would want things just so like that,3.00,2100
i generally dislike this band but i figure it is about time i take a listen to this i downloaded it in early 2004  hey i was busy anyways this may just be their best album as it seems to be the bridge between the collegiate litegrunge of their early records the bland period and the alienated electronic moaning of their later records the boring period let down and no surprises are certainly pretty and paranoid android showcases their dynamics fairly well the rest ranges from mopey but memorable to hunhwhatthefug i mean it is not like it is the greatest album of all time or anything wait what,4.00,597
i have given this record so many chances in the end i always come out meh,3.00,73
i have to admit i actually prefer kid a and amnesiac to ok computer in part because of the second half of this album which actually does contain some forgettable tracks or at least i often forget about them you could say that it is frontloaded for that reason but for a band whose previous album was the bends this seems like a huge step forward without plunging off of a cliff like they would proceed to do there is way more sonic detail and interesting stylistic choices paranoid android might be the most popular song in 78 and a development of lyrical matter beyond 90s hipster introspection into philosophical themes or like prey2k political paranoia in general a really lovely album but like i do not know if it means as much to me as kid a or amnesiac does relative to how much people hold this one up as their pinnacle and everything else afterwards as just a dalliance in experimental electronic music,0.50,910
the soundtrack to life the thing about this album is it just never wears out it will still blow you away the 10000th time you listen to it,5.00,138
this one is a grower like almost every radiohead album it is a piece of musical art that you have to take your time to discover and appreciate fully when i first wanted to start to listen to radiohead i asked a friend about which album i should pick first and i was handed ok computer on first listen some songs immediately pleased me  or blew me away  especially paranoid android this multiparts masterpiece but what is wonderful about this release is the way it seems to change every time you listen to it revealing more and more of its treasures with each listen airbag the opener is a great rock song which allows the band to immediately grab your attention before it surprises you with paranoid android gets you melancholic with exit music thoughtful with karma police let down and no surprises in my opinion there really is no way you cannot love something on this album maybe saying it is the best album of all time is a bit too much it has its weaker parts but it has indeed a lot to offer and deserves its place amongst my favorite albums i always loved radiohead after that,4.00,1083
an okay album it did not overwhelm me as i expected from such a popular album  it drifted along in a derivative mode okay,3.00,121
i had never really cared much for the little i had heard of radiohead before listening to this album but this album surprised me airbag was somewhat appealing then paranoid android comes on and blows me away unfortunately i cannot say the same about the rest of the album during which i found myself itching for it to just end already regardless a respectful effort,3.50,365
one of the best albums of all time airbag 810 best opener ever just blows away on the first listen on repeated listening it gets a bit stale but still it is a good song paranoid android 910 the song that people will remember first and second act are great third again gets stale but it holds the flag high subterranean homesick alien 610 possibly the worst track on ok computer it is not bad but when compared to the rest it seems too fillerish lyrics are good though exit music for a film 810 great song a ballad with guts i personally love the mellotron choir let down 910 what a beast of a song lyrics really stand out music never gets stale great pop song karma police 910 again great lyrics possibly the best known radiohead song after creep sounds very poppy and proggy at the same time fitter happier 810 well i do not know why everybody hate this song i like it it sets the tone to the second dark half electioneering 810 rock on has a britpop sound the end is especially great climbing up the walls 910 radioheads most experimental song on ok computer treads water in the electronic genre no surprises 1010 best song on this album best song in the world also short and sweet lyrics are excellent happy music coupled with dark violent lyrics lucky 710 borrows much from pink floyd showcases jonnys guitar work the tourist 910 great ender has a jazzy feel to it possibly because the writer of this song is jonny greenwood who really likes jazz reminds me of kid as jazzy songs like how to disappear compleatly and national anthem,0.50,1536
i like thom yorke he is the kind of guy i would go for a pint with down the local and talk about conspiracy theories to then he would invite me back to his place for a couple more beers and the rest of the band would come round and he would be all like this is a new song we just wrote no surprises and be like i am not sure i want to bring down the government though thom i just come along for the free beer to be honest and i would edge my way to the door and start running down the street but radiohead would be right behind me playing the opening off airbag on a loop and just be like fuuuuck eventually they would catch me and make me join a cult where everyone commits suicide,4.50,682
if they took just the first 6 tracks it would be the greatest ep ever made,4.50,74
generally completely fucking tiresome to sit through but it does have a couple catchy numbers strewn throughout no surprises sums up the entire album starts off well enough with some rocking numbers before tripping over with exit music and let down which are obvious filler karma police picks it up again and climbing up the walls and no surprises rounds off the album nicely before thom yorkes maudlin croon overtakes the end with some awful stadium sized anthems,1.50,464
saturated with depressing beauty that captivates listeners it is musical content is significant and weighs heavily,5.00,114
the only flaw of this album is a white cover it should be much darker because this is some kind of a musical journey through the cold and lonely night incredible stuff,4.50,167
i feel stressed quick pass me that computer it might help me with my stress which is in part caused by the seeming epoch of rush and strain ushered in by the advent of the computer oh no the computer reflects who we are as humans in confronting and conflicting ways,4.00,265
i cannot lie to myself any more this is a nearperfect album that was highly influential to me fuck 47858558585 out of 5 or whatever i truly feel let us round that son of a bitch up to 5,5.00,185
ok computer that is enough anything that is number one of anything has to be overrated,3.50,86
brilliant they were pioneers of new music back then and still continue to evolve,5.00,80
as cult as it is inspired a timeless album standard of a generation in the top 5 albums of the 90s,5.00,98
this album is amazing the most important of the 90s i cannot think of any other album with the lyrical impact of this one the best of all time why not ok it is not influential as the beatles albums but it is undeniable that perfection was reached in 11 fitter happier is not a song songs my favorite part is the falsetto in let down is so god damn beautiful that always makes me cry,5.00,382
the album does not need explaining for it is greatness the music speaks for itself but best album of all time i do not know about that,5.00,134
a 90s classic but if it is the greatest album of all time then i am columbus,5.00,76
upping to a 45 because of let down which has got to be one of the best songs,4.50,76
this is now legitimately considered the greatest album of all time is it better than abbey road and revolver i am still sticking with yes,5.00,137
as i currently write this this album is now in the number one spot for greatest album of all time i loved radiohead saw them in concert studied all their stuff i get this feeling about them now like i do the velvet underground and wu tang clan  i feel like i get it now but eventually i will mature musically and fade out of it well for those of you that have not enjoyed a psychedelic experience it often tends to cleanse my doors of perception so to speak and completely eliminates the preconcieved notions temporarily that make up our conscious and subconscious judgements during an experience such as above stated i put on my kid a 10 inch lp and it clickedagain this time it clicked that these guys may make decent popish art rockish stuff to me similar to beatles and pink floyd and other brilliant modern british pop performers in the realms near but below them but they have not pioneered it ya know it is good but i do not feel it is groundbreaking like their forefathers not that this is radioheads fault you do not choose when you are born who knows if it was released thirty years before i would probably be looking at this hand in hand with the velvet underground  nico,4.50,1182
i can understand the anger of some although i do not believe in making music rankings and i do not lose my life in who is first in this or that page this album does not seem to me to correspond to  1 or with a better score than any of the beatles since 1965 to say just one example without making any comparison of sounds that is untenable beyond being an excellent album and a classic of the 90s it is highly overrated especially for a supposed musical originality that is not such being clearly influenced by the progressive rock of the 60s and 70s especially german krautrock but hey there it is by the way electioneering and climbing up the walls get more boring every time i listen to them again,4.50,700
it is overated a lot i enjoyed this for a while but i do not play this any more nowadays if we should name this album a masterpiece it should be a timeenduring thing a classic,4.50,175
uhm overrated as hell there are some songs that are quite good paranoid android no surprises exit music but also has a lot of fillers fitter happier the tourist electioneering note that i am in fact a radiohead fella but this album is not good as kid a hail to the thief or in rainbows nuff said he goes and listen to idioteque,2.00,327
hmm i do not get it ok this is a nice album but there is nothing which makes me say this sounds like a masterpiece or even the best album of all time  a bit overrated is not it,3.50,176
my favorite track is no surprises airbag is a strong opener the medium tempo song combines a rythmic trance beat inspired by dj shadow with dream like overtones to set the mood for the album and showcases one of thom yorkes stronger vocal performances which in general is not the bands most formidible aspect,3.50,308
an album so good that all artists from here on out stopped making good music because they knew they could never match up to it i mean seriously just every second of it is perfection except for tracks 78 but we do not talk about them,5.00,232
a record of which everything and too much has been said which became epochal in a few years and indispensable from every point of view not perfect in my opinion due to some length and a certain disparity of inspiration between the most sublime pieces and the others in any case a manifesto of rock culture that says everything about what rock has been and where it has arrived at the end of the century,4.50,402
it is ok computer  not one of the radiohead following legions did a very good job ripping off this album because for all of its echoes you hear in alternative rock of the 2000s it still sounds completely unique completely fresh this is a record where the thinking was not done outside of the box this is a record where the box was fed to a cow and the cows milk tasted like cardboard afterwards so little jimmy poured it down the drain which went into a garburator which fed then into the city water supply causing the sewers to explode yeahhh the songs in themselves are all great it is technically brilliant full of electronic strands waiting to be discovered the first track airbag is about a man surviving a car crash or easily any neardeath situation and taking on a new view on life because of it it is just as excitable as it sounds of course famous paranoid android follows the six minute epic that simply must be heard to be believed subterranean homesick alien is a nice breather a throughly reverberated daydream the album flows nicely through to the next two songs exit music and a soaring highlight let down then we hit karma police the albums centrepiece and arguably one of radioheads crowning achievements the only song that never fails to give me goosebumps with every listen it has an impeccable buildup the lyrics remind me of a feverish nightmare in the first verses people are being arrested for opaque reasons up until the protagonist himself is prosecuted frantically trying to save himself offering no closure the song takes off in an unforgettable climax in fitter happier we cross over into the darker half of the record it is a computer reciting a list of positive attributes that could easily come from a selfhelp book and if you pay attention it is appropriately disturbing electioneering is really bends flavoured guitar rock as is sometimes suggested one of the weaker tracks on the record but hardly a throwaway climbing up the walls is the last track before the albums downtempo ending stretch a song written from the viewpoint of a murder or maybe a psychiatric patient with distorted vocals and some gorgeous strings no surprises is one of the only real modern alienation tracks on ok computer it is the old story about a character with a throughly souldraining life in the suburbs with everything anyone would ever want but never really happy it is not difficult to hear it as being about suicide and the beautiful soothing melody only ends up twisting the knife one of the most affecting songs here the only real misstep here is at the very end lucky continues in the vein of no surprises but despite its optimistic lyrics it is a very sombre song  revealingly it was recorded not long after the bends it would make a brilliant closer but instead it follows with the tourist a ballad neither as heartrending as lucky and no surprises nor as simply igoodi as karma police or paranoid android it is not bad but not very interesting either but that hardly seems to matter when so many great tracks come before it is not quite the modern alienation album that you have probably heard it summed up as but it is still great and it is still relatable and it is as relevant as it was the day it was released iplease could you stop the noisei,5.00,3270
do not get the love for this album i find it quite boring kid a is much better,3.00,78
there is little that can be said about radioheads ok computer that has not already been said apart from that fact that i prefer kid a 2011 update i am not so sure now besides that rate your musics most owned album is a progressive rock masterpiece which oddly enough has never really been considered prog this aside the unique blend which is radiohead is a pleasure to behold and with the mega hits paranoid android karma police and no surprises the album could do no wrong i openly admit to being a greatest hits junkie the odd little intermission track fitter happier is the albums only real weakness at first i did not mind this electronic voice preaching at me however several years on it has become more tolerable i think the albums wide appeal is mainly thanks to the wide ranging fusions of sound with this deluxe collectors addition further tantalising the eardrums with an additional cd of extras including extended sleeve notes,4.50,937
lyrics are interesting like karma police and subterranean homesick alien the sound reflects late 1990s,4.00,102
if you rate this album anything less than 5 stars you are a dolt that has no clue about music this album is as close to perfection as you will find it is technically musically and emotionally as good as modern rock gets not many albums redefine music but ok computer was one of those rare albums an absolute masterpiece just a pity no one else took up the baton other than radiohead themselves,5.00,393
after a lot of perplexity and skepticism on the real value of the album that is so highly praised here and elsewhere i will say in the end that it is very strong and very creative everything is linked with a magnificent fluidity and a constant intensity in the revolt the and singing the inner cry we are transported into high musical moral and artistic spheres nevertheless two pieces out of 12 whose noisy electioneering prevents us from qualifying him as a work and give it 5 stars for now and for me,4.00,503
airbag parts of paranoid android and all of exit music are either good or really good it is just after exit music ok computer is just swamped in boredom stuffs that simply go nowhere i have no problem with the high praise for this album but i choose not to listen unless i have an insomnia bout,2.00,294
lol seriously people write things like oh you people are deaf or you have no taste in music everyone has their own taste in music get that in your head,0.50,151
perhaps the biggest masterpiece to be written this album will still be listened to in year 3000 this is our generations dark side of the moon no doubt about it,5.00,159
absolute masterpiece though surprisingly i like hail to the thief even a bit more,5.00,81
i really enjoyed this when i was in high school now that i am older i cannot believe i ever liked it so much i honestly will never understand why this gets so much love i can never get throught itlet down is the only track i seek out to listen too ever now,2.50,256
airbag  drawn out and mostly interesting in the brief vocalless section near the end 255 paranoid android  after the slow start this picks up considerably and keeps the soundscape a lot more interesting with more variety and effort thrown in 455 subterranean homesick alien  another of the drawn out ones but better executed then airbag by far 45 exit music for a film  musicianship here is excellent and shines out over the other tracks thus far by miles 55 let down  more of the same old radiohead sound nothing special to write home about 355 karma police  the best song on the album and possibly in radioheads discography 55 fitter happier  filler 055 electioneering  a nice faster paced number to wake us up after the filler 45 climbing up the walls  sort of shoegazey in a jamc style way lots of texture which stands out from the usual sparseness 455 no surprises  back to thom being mopey with an oddly cheery pianoxylophone stuff going on the background it is one of the albums shorter cuts which helps it a lot 355 lucky  though not offensive overly repetitive and drawn out 35 the tourist  back to the drawn out mopeyness and without anything interesting in the music to take away from it 25 so overall a 35 which i will bump to a 4 since the 05 was a filler interlude a few great songs but mixed amidst generic stuff and some outright boring tracks,4.00,1359
who can explain to me what the fuck is going on with this first place of all sorts of lists,4.50,91
you know i do not think many people have taken a step back and looked at this album or radiohead in general and asked themsevles what is it about this band that i like i feel like it is become this default notion that people who like alternative rock art rock or generes similar to those have to like radiohead they have been around for a long time are still making music keep themselves out of the public eye and stick to their signature sound and style for the most part nearly everyone i have talked to about radiohead says with confidence that this is their best ablum with all due respect i disagree i actually think the album is overrated i used to listen to radiohead much more than i do now as i got into other forms of music and started making my own music it kind of pushed me away from them a bit i started thinking about each of their albums and when it came to ok computer i realized that i only really listen to maybe 30 of the album airbag opens the album wonderfully i have always enjoyed it everyone knows paranoid android but i actually think this song could have been a lot better i think the song is a bit too complex for it is own good i think it should have been a slower song in general everything before the heavy breakdown should have been at a slower tempo and the chorus could have been something different i like the heavy breakdown but after that i almost never listen to it subterranean homesick alien has a lot of potential i think if it would have been an instrumental track it would have been much better exit music for a film is a bit too somber and plain but it holds it is place on the album more than others i think if thom yorkes vocals on it would have been a bit lower and with effects it would have been better let down had a lot of potential as well but where they took the song with the drums and rhythms just does not grab me a lot of the vocals on this album i just do not like enough karma police is the first real standout track on the album i would not change anything about this song i actually would have probably made this song longer but is not that a compliment fitter happier is a take it or leave it song purely filler but it has the lyrics that many radiohead fans seem to like electioneering has a pearl jam feeling to it that i know many people like but it is never been a good song to me climbing up the walls should have been a strictly instrumentals song maybe with faint vocals with lots of echo effects as the song picks up no surprises is the second real standout track on the album from the second it comes on your attention is grabbed and you feel like you are on this little cloud it has such a nice style to it i have always really enjoyed it lucky to me is too much pink floyd and it is never found it is way into me it is not a bad song but it is just not a song i enjoy thom yorkes vocals have actually come to bother me in a way they have this whining quality about them that seems to repeat itself the tourist is one of the stronger tracks on the album but again should have been without vocals i would actually like to see a strictly instrumental album by radiohead i think that would be pretty amazing after this album radiohead became more experimental and recorded what i think are better albums kid a and amnesiac for all the music they make like red hot chili peppers and many other bands how many of their songs do you really honestly listen to and enjoy,3.00,3434
apart from fitter happier which is an instant skip this album is fantastic and a must buy paranoid android let down and no surprises are masterpieces,5.00,149
there is one thing i do not understand ok computer is considered the best album of all time by members of the site but members of the site are not too fond of achtung baby by u2 one dates from 1991 and is signed by a band that has had bad press for 20 years and the other is from 1997 and is signed by a band that has good press since we are talking about ok computer here the album is good melancholic  which makes it boring and will lead to suicide after too many repeated listening  modern with these little hacks done on a  computer electionneering  which actually sounds like u2 in the end  is surely the song that rocks the most the one that looks like rock you know the thing with balls and grease everywhere to listen to to love but certainly not to put on the first step of the podium,4.00,793
since i was not a teenager in the 90s this whole alternative rock and the lifestyle that goes with it angstos mood is foreign to me of course i am often caught by the enui only different very different and with this record it becomes clear how very foreign  the second half of the album is say the kid a half and that is why i even hear something i am interested in but it is far from enough to deal with it again it is tiring because he wants to document the zeitgeist at the time so concisely so maniacally that it is practically meaningless to me afterwards,3.00,560
take the alchemy of the record industry 1 we are looking for a drummer bald because hair growth is biologically adjusted at most there is a bit of fluff and he is barely thirty years old 2 a bass player hackfresse optically otherwise inconspicuous 3 a muddle head with equally muddled hairdo for guitars and keys impossible posture more eccentric in the pinky toe than the rest of the world 4 another guitarist at least handsome because gene is friendly here but also at least shy looker introverted 5 the front man burnt down robert smith rat haircut between blonde and witch red one eye busted awkward demeanor ruder than the sheriff of nottingham world hater you send them out into the world have them record records give concerts videos etc and meanwhile bathe in the coal that this traveling circus of bizarreness is bringing in actually unbelievable but how else to explain the success of the band radiohead maybe it is because of the quality of the music this disc starts out so subdued thom yorke threatens tenderly i am back to save the universe to which the band rumbles along in a strange rhythm but the phil collins fans are already flabbergasted scared off 30 billion potential customers worldwide yikes and yet there is this sticker on the box no 1 uk are not there any collins fans there or are they in the minority there the uk home of the sane that melting pot of romans celts angles jutes saxons normans jamaicans pakistanis indians skinheads etc wonderful and radiohead keep turning the wheel now they are getting into politics because when thom yorke who has unborn chickens racing around in his brain is finally dictator some people will lose their heads ah finally robespierres successor is in sight the salvation of mankind holy do not tell anyone that this madness has no method the schizophrenic illustrations on the cd booklet also follow a silent path through the undergrowth of negativity and dark rain falls from the highest heights between massive guitar blasts that grate on my nerves and panic puke and appropriately yuppie eating it is said that god loves his children yes says sat 1 thom yorke and leo kirch son and father but more in the tradition of oedipus and he would certainly like to strike thom there is an aggression buried in radioheads music just below the surface that could melt the entire socalled metal scene has there ever been a record in pole position in europes most important market where the listener was called out we hope you are throwing up that is what you hear at the end of the heavenly exit music for a film chimaeras mirrors black magic these are the radioheads toys and as the record progresses you get the feeling things are getting worse more drastic and the music it eats your brain karma police appears to have been a jam session by reinhard mey with the middle beatles towards the end acid king syd appears and distributes lsd  gogo and the music takes off in bright colors including artful feedback and the words the girl with the hitler haircut who drives thom yorke completely insane by breaking up her party this is what you get when you mess with us clear case one should have known but ugh he just lost control for a moment citation well here is the thing with zeus the mighty in addition the confused player plays the jingle piano heartbreakingly drama tears in my eyes after this record the touched listener can fn many other musics until the sz bg is or the other way around mannerism everywhere in all tones in an implementation that is unparalleled in these times everything absolutely wanted and called walk in where else is this mansun yes perhaps weltekel is also just an eightletter word anger anger anger is the motto of this record that the band nearly broke up during the recording well it is no wonder at all that they are more likely to continue and the fact that this disc became a hit is no longer explained by alchemy but by the fact that huge numbers of cd buyers are the purest dead nuts who in my opinion would have to pay a loose monthly wage per copy for such a record so that they realize which products they are handling or to put it another way radioheads ok computer was the arno schmidt record of 1997 and i hope you choke on your vomit no quote,4.00,4247
and while this album was in 2nd place for some time it could be called underestimated,3.50,85
this is indeed the best album of the 90s all the acclaim that it gathers is justified highlights for me subterranean homesick alien let down no surprises the tourist,5.00,165
as an evolution of a band this is a great step it drones on a bit in places but overall the concept is sound highlights for me are paranoid android and karma police time has definitely improved this for me i would have rated it 25 stars when i heard it after it was released i can appreciate the more subtle details now,4.00,319
i got this album in 10th grade after my friend told me it was his favorite album ever i hazed it logically because i have an awful personality but the recommendation stuck and the next time i was at barns  nobel i picked it up my cute little high school brain basically imploded but because i was a 10th grader i would almost always stop the album at fitter happier a childs mistake side two is much more subtle minus electioneering than the dynamic first side but once you digest it and really start feeling out the tracks your bound to have a glop of love be spread out across your self it is a pretty swell feeling,4.00,617
because of fitter happier and one or two solid tracks i can never consider ok computer a perfect album,4.50,102
ok what has not been said about this album it will not be topped anytime soon unless by radiohead album standouts paranoid android subterranean homesick alien let down karma police climbing up the walls lucky,5.00,208
not as good and moody as kid a but a hell of an album it is so epic and complex and layered that it gives me the chills paranoid android is seriously one of the best singles ever lucky karma police airbag exit music for a film no surprises and climbing up the walls are also perfect the rest is just very very very good almost perfect 455,5.00,338
easy one of the best albums in history,5.00,38
radiohead in general was not an easy band for me to get into after multiple listens i finally started to get a feel for their musical sound and now i appreciate it i think it is definetely worth a owning and hearing but like i said most people will not capture it is true value on a first listen still i do think its over rated only slightly only because it is ranked higher than in the court of the crimson king,4.00,412
this album made history in 1990s rock music with many singleoriented songs that at the same time are also quite experimental,5.00,124
always crap zero but they are strong damn,4.00,41
the most overated album of all time yes paranoid android is an epic karma police is damn good and no suprises is okaythe rest is crapi have listened to it about 100 times to try to get it but generally it is very very bland,2.50,223
if i could get rid of everything but the guitar  it might be ok but once again the vocalist pisses on what might have been ok mind you just ok,1.50,142
first time i heard this i admit i was blown away i had never heard anything like it there certainly is no denying these guys talent but for some reason this album did not have the staying power i thought it would the first 6 tracks are great but with the exception of no suprises it just fades out after that for me until soon enough i just got bored with it all together no doubt a good record just do not see the massive hype this continues to get,3.50,449
i am trying to find something interesting and attractive here but i still cannot  that two very good singles and that is it,2.50,123
one of the best records of all time for me definitely one of the most boring records of all time and badly produced on top of that,2.50,130
good record but kid a is better every album that came put after 01 owes something to kid a,4.50,90
it is not bad but i find myself enjoying albums that rip this one off way more than the album itself maybe it is just been spoiled by admiration,4.00,144
probably radioheads best one reviewer said they ripped off muse i am sure it is the other way around anyway this is only let down by the slow pace throughout electioneering trys to break this but it does not work the rest of the album is pretty good very good not something i would play a lot but i will still be playing it when i am old and grey,4.00,346
electioneering is the only song that is not exceptional but it is still pretty damn good,5.00,88
i was a little slow to the radiohead party in that i did not actually own any of their albums until the later 2000s not even when they were huge in high school days since buying this album i have discovered that it is got some amazing tunes beyond just the singles i knew from it the opening track for example is my favourite song from the album even though it also has some massive hits that are great songs it was only around 2010 that i really became obsessed with airbag and realised what i would been missing radiohead are certainly a band that have mixed it up a fair bit with their releases and i admit i do not own them all yet i do want to say one thing though  the pumpkins were the first huge band to release a double album for free download online hello machina ii so radiohead did not do it first okaaaaay favourite tracks airbag paranoid android exit music for a film karma police no surprises,4.50,907
how can this album be overrated i cannot think of an album that evokes as much emotion combined with haunting melodies and soaring lyric delivery musically i would not necessarily call it innovative as much as perfectly composed and produced like other albums in my top 5 eg abbey road ziggy stardust the listener gets much more out of the experience by listening to the album as a whole instead of skipping to certain tracks to me that is the sign of a classic i do understand how it might not connect with certain people but if you are on this page writing a review of it something got you,5.00,591
i had not heard this album until today it is a very easy record to admire  however after one play i am really not sure if i like it,3.50,131
radioheads best album and a good album indeed but a bit overrated the albums good points defintely starts the really good songs it has airbag climbing up the walls especially paranoid android what a song crazy that they got it from the beatles happiness is a warm gun which by the way is a great song too if you have not listened to it you should check it out but back to paranoid android if you do not like that song you do not like rock period another big plus is that none of the songs suck somell say fittier happier sucks cuz it is technically not a song but i feel it goes with the album in its own weird way that is very rare to have an album where none of the songs suck also the flow of the album as a whole is pretty good not on par with what is going on and sgt peppers but still good the lyrics are some of the songs electrioneering no suprises were interesting too this album also sounds concentrated meaning they had a vision for every song on the album and came up with the melodies etc to match the visions they had for the songs another plus i personally am a fan of different types of music and like having different styles of music in my collection and this album is very leftfield it has it is own style which i love it has quite a few drawbacks the main being while there are no whack songs only paranoid android airbag and climbing up the walls stand out to the point that you forget that you listened to the other songs some songs like electrioneering no surprises and subterranean homesick alien are pretty good but they are no match for those 3 songs which brings it to another drawback the songs i said did not stand out almost all of them sound alike i feel like i am listening to a variation of the same song throughout the album with a few outliers along the way 3rd those songs are very boring as well it has no hype to them at all mainly it is because the music instrumental have no substance their music is good because of the relms it creates you can see the music but you cannot feel it and with that those songs sound alike and the fact that they are thinking beats and no rhythm beats it only adds up to boredom another big problem is the singer himself another rock frontman who cannot sing he sounds like he whining the whole album you know it is true especially when you cannot understand a word he is saying that will make someone never listen to the album again big turnoff i had to look up the lyrics on the internet only to find most the lyrics do not make sense ridiculous as many flaws as it has i can actually see why this album has a following i can also see why many radiohead feel it is their best album which it is and i can also see why people like the bends better now kid a i do not know but i can see the bends and as much as i said bad about this album it is actually pretty good but it is not for everyone another reason to add why it is not the best album in the world the are quite a few rock albums better than this sgt peppers revolver led zeppelin iv and loveless to name a few it is still better than a lot of other rock albums listen at your own risk best songs paranoid android their best song period not just best album song airbag climbing up the walls no surprises subterranean homesick alien worst song fittier happier,3.50,3286
this is a very good album all rates or polls or awards dont mean much really is the kings speech the best 2010 movie of the hole planet thats subjectiveand we dont know so the speech of this beeing the best album of all times is useless it might be a revelation to someone or a very weak record for other human being here with my 4 stars i can say i like it a lot and that if you like music you should listen to this at least once its a very melancholic album so dont look to party with it but if its your birthday and you are alone and no one has called you you may want to listen to no surprises it will make you feel better or make you want to dissapear again that is subjective in a partil evaluation this album was quite earthquake in musical and popular terms back in its time and it is considered to be one of the huge albums along with some beatles miles davis and led zeppellin,4.50,886
i never really listened to this until my early to mid 20s had i back as a teenager i think i would have been much more affected by it i listened to too much grunge american 90s radio alternative rock and nu metal i guess i will probably go to my grave regarding fantastic planet as the holy grail of alternative rock so considering all that and other circumstances i feel i will not ever fully connect to it but at least i have come to have reasonable appreciation for it no doubt many people would still want to burn me at the stake regardless this is symbolism at its finest,3.00,576
great album all the tracks mesh well together  but not my favourite,3.50,67
maybe i just do not get it but at times this is just dreary miserable music either that or it actually does suck hard,3.50,117
excellent album there is nothing left but to be surprised with every sound and letter that this album brings,5.00,108
brilliant songwriting there is something missing so i could give full five stars my favourites subterranean homesick alien and karma police,4.00,139
there was a period of time when this was the only thing i listened to now that the honeymoon period is over i think i can look at it analytically and suggest that for some reason it does not flow right it has some of my favourite radiohead songs karma police let down climbing up the walls but as a whole it does not feel as epic or even complete as the later radiohead albums,4.00,376
i probably would appreciate ok computer more if it is 1997 or 1998 and i do not know what a kid a is i see this more as a transition album between the bends and kid a it is like they knew where they wanted to go but were to scared to go the full way there are genius moments on it no doubt the bends had also genius moments later these moments would become whole songs,4.00,368
great radiohead album not my favourite adore kid a   but it contains great songs as paranoid android and the very hopeless let down karma police the outter space experience fitter happier but the rest of the songs are still good,4.50,228
dark side of the moon for the 90s is that a good or a bad thing well it all depends if you like grandiose stadium anthems as for me i like them in small doses but a whole albums worth is draining,4.00,195
after spending most of my teen years listening to mostly hip hop with classic rock and reggae tossed in ok computer drew me into the alternative rock scene of the time a true modern day classic they really have their own sound although pink floyd is a definite influence i would guess swirling guitars experimental production techniques and an original sound very much like progressive rock with shorter songs the opening bassline on airbag grabs your attention and the music is brilliant throughout highlights include the eerie climbing up the walls exit music for a film and no surprises the best song here is probably the best song they ever recorded paranoid android everything great about this album in one perfect song in the grand scheme a bit overrated because i do not think it is in the the top 10 albums of all time but easily top 25 and far and away the best rock album of the 90s,5.00,892
1 star for the song paranoid android and 1 star for no surprises rest is boring meaningless and completly devoid of soul and energy such a waste of talented musicians buy the vastly superior the bends instead,2.00,208
as sure as eggs is eggs i do agree with kylethecat review  this album is praised too highly overvalued overrated and so on  this does not deserve to be that high in any ranking a lot of album are far more valuable that ok computer but well i would not say this is a bad album neither i can go through without getting annoyed by the length or the lack of quality in certain songs the prod in fact is well balanced from energetic rhythm to sorrowful ambiance maybe i exaggerate a bit with the term sorrowful so for concluding fast this is a fine rock album but not a stand out one that blown up everything and changed the way of thinking the combination of producing beauty of forms harmony and expression of emotions,4.00,715
ive never heard such guitar tones and such innovative guitar work as the ones on ok computer i can undoubtely say this album have changed my way of playing or thinking about music i could extend this review and and fill it with praise for many and many lines but why everything i say someone has said even better than i so let us sum it up this album deserves all praises that it has been received since its release ok computer is without doubt a milestone of modern music,5.00,472
if somebody wants to encapsulate the 90s musically visually video clips but not only that easily might be this album the band blends a lot of things here starting from acoustic guitars to heavy alternative riffs all set in an art rock package even if they do not like to speak about it this bears an influence of 70s prog as well they acknowledge the impact of can but the early psychedelia is also detectable climbing up the walls subterranean homesick alien the amazing production highlights the keyboards the most and the ethereal jingling is an essential to the greatness of this the lyrics speak about car crash and survivals luck airbag criticism of sentimentality let down alienation in modern british life subterranean homesick alien romeo and juliet exit music health and mental issues and criticism to capitalism and corporate lifestyle fitter happier and various topics of modern day life which are still relevant today some of the greatest albums ever and a staple of the 90s greatest songs paranoid android subterranean homesick alien climbing up the walls least great songs fitter happier rating 47,4.50,1112
a great album that gave the whole world one of the best songs of the last decade  karma police,4.00,94
its a pretty good album but quite overrated i cannot exactly get myself to listen to this over and over again like many other great albums but there are many good songs as an album however it does not exactly flow for me,4.00,220
karma police is one of the greatest songs of all time majestic emotive quirky argh,4.50,82
if electioneering and the tourist was not in the album it would be perfect the rest songs are amazing examples of really great songwriting and inspired musicianship it is ok 1 overall no wayis this a joke,4.50,204
i think it is a pretty good album but to call this the greatest album ever made according to rym it is is the biggest joke i have ever heard absolutely insane no no it is not,3.50,174
i got this on cd a few years ago and i really feel like aside from all of my kiddy cds this is the worst one i own i have always struggled with getting into this album despite the fact that i love radiohead,2.50,206
i remember around this time an exgirlfriend describing this album as commercial rock not sure whether she was purposely trying to wind me up or she really did believe that radiohead recorded something like this with a surefire daytime radio smash hit foremost in their minds whatever the case you have to admit there must be easier ways to ensure top ten single success than releasing a mournful 6 and a half minute prog rock opus but tell that to queen lol ok maybe it is not half as experimental and ground breaking as alot of pontificating music journos have made out but its still one of the greatest rock albums of the 90s and looking back at that comment my ex made i think it makes sense that we split up,5.00,711
very interesting work of course but a bit overrated i would say i believe the later work of radiohead is more interesting but i must admit for 1997 that was major,4.50,162
i love this album why does everyone think it is their best i do not understand that it is really good but kid a is best in fact i prefer a few of their releases to this album it just was the start of something beautiful that is all,4.00,231
another highly overrated album still excellent while i perfer a few radiohead albums to ok computer this one still does a fine job showing off all the bands best qualities i highly reccomend it to fans of 90s british rock bands like radiohead and blur radiohead really did become a better band over all once they moved out of britpop territory and went into a more artrock field me being an american am much more at home with pixies and velvet underground influenced wierdness than britpop mostly just because i am a stupid yank,5.00,528
a unintentionally conceptual album that i think this is no exaggeration has come to define modern life and all of its paranoia separation and unforgivingness airbag defines a distinctly modern arrogance born out of strange salvation which is also explored in a cyclic fashion in the tourist subterranean homesick alien defines loneliness with its yearning guitar tones and now subdued now yearning vocal exit music defines melancholy transporting a centuriesold tale into the modern age in a dense crush of keyboards and effects fitter happier which many mistakenly call a throwaway defines the danger of losing oneself in modern distraction and routine electioneering defines modern politics climbing up the walls defines the insanity always lurking behind the faade in fact the entire album is about danger behind a cozy exterior like the carbonmonoxidelaced handshake in no surprises it bewails modernity yet owes so much of its power to modern sounds and techniques making the complaint more troubling than anything else even more ironically it is a question which i will happily grapple with for many many more listens,5.00,1123
this album has a compelling eeire atmospherewhen it came out i would been playing guitar for 24 years and paranoid android had chord changes that i would never heard before which gives the whole song a dissonance that is both strange and disconcertingit is also deeply disturbing to hear an outstanding vocalist like thom yorke effectively mumbling his way through the whole recordpart of the greatness of this album is that radiohead were never part of the mainstream and like pink floyd there is no way they are ever going to give in to their audiences pre conception of what a radiohead album should sound likethis is both great and original some combination,4.50,661
some tracks were brilliant on this album though others lack radioheads true potential,4.00,85
i have talked my fair share of trash about this album in the past and i have to admit i was wrong it is a good album it just took a really long time to grow on me i do not think it is the greatest piece of art created in the 21st century as i once saw a particularly hyperbole prone fan put it but it is good i think my favorite thing about it is the atmosphere it has an atmosphere that is surreal melancholy and whimsical sometimes reminding me a little of a 90s alternative version of pink floyd paranoid android and karma police tend to get regarded as the best songs but i like some of the other songs better than them it is pretty consistent with the exception of the annoying fitter happier which i always skip and the tourist and electioneering which i find pretty bland thom yorke has a voice that i cannot quite embrace it works well on some songs but on others it can be a little annoying and at times feels a bit histrionic to me the guitar is largely the key to the album for me as the layered guitar parts are really where most of the great atmosphere is coming from,4.00,1080
a bit overrated still awesome nonetheless 1 airbag  355 2 paranoid android  455 3 subterranean homesick alien  35 4 exit music for a film  35 5 let down  55 6 karma police  455 7 fitter happier  355 8 electioneering  45 9 climbing up the walls  45 10 no surprises  45 11 lucky  355 12 the tourist  45 standouts  paranoid android let down karma police,4.50,350

excellent album that was the reason i started listening to music the variety of songs as well as the quality of every track has made it worth playing frequently for 6 years,4.50,172
excellent album all in all musicianship very solid atmospheric sounds outstanding compositions and one whole track of computer talking the only complaint is about the vocals mostly they are brilliant but sometimes it sounds like a lazy mule on the other hand i would give my other hand to sound like that lazy mule highly recommended,4.50,333
simply one of the greatest most melodic sublimely written albums of all time paranoid android rocks and is probably the greatest single alongside bohemian rhapsody that said the other tracks on this albums reach same highs by very diverse means exit musics emotional outburst karma cops lyrical irony etc this album should be mandatory listening to anyone slightly interested in popular music,4.50,392
good albumbut very overrated album i think this album is not better than dark side of the moon or many albums of beatles and songs in this album are ordinary but paranoid android is awesome,4.00,189
truly is worth the hype genuinely is that good yadda yadda and on and on nobody will read this so best memories to this one  age 13 had an online friend on aim who loved it and insisted i hear it and it was sent to me as 128 kbs mp3 attachments in 12 separate gmails and i burned it to a cd and sat there doing nothing but listening to it and thought it was a dumb pink floyd ripoff  when moon shaped pool came out we invited a crew over to hear it on my roommates nice stereo in our attic and that album ended and i go to the restroom and hear airbag begin and think oh christ and walk up there and everyone is got a drink in hand and they are all standing and shouting and we just went from there and i thought yeah it really is that good  solo walk up a hill in a tiny mountain fjord town in norway to this record walking up from below the fog then through it then above it and looking at the whole landscape covered in it with only the tops of mountains poking out this sounds pretentious as fuck but i am leaving it in cus that really was amazing  italy trip 2018 little bench on a cliffside walkway in riomaggiore bottle of wine or two and i think this slipped in between amy winehouse and sinatra most stars i ever saw in my life  germany trip 2019 last night of the trip park in berlin bottle of wine a bit after sunset overlooking the city again i am sorry fuck i am just fucking saying i took trips by myself for myself and played this album at important memorable times so i could associate it with the experience anyway it is that good i am sorry it is what is wrong with everyone agreeing on something for once can we just have this one album these songs all have a pretty mood to me despite being varied it is a specific feeling that is unique to just this album a sense of bittersweet optimism perhaps simultaneously sad and uplifting but more than that  it is hard to describe but if you are familiar with it you should know what i mean i think it breaks for a few minutes with fitter happier and electioneering  am i so bad for skipping those sometimes  but comes back as strong as ever let down and no surprises in particular put that tone on the heaviest with their similar guitar parts this checks all my boxes brilliant songwriting that is easy to sing along to despite enigmatic lyrics masterfully detailed and spacious production practiced musicianship it is alltime level on every front paranoid android is one of the masterpiece songs in recorded music one which has never failed to leave me in awe i am glad that so many people love this album and continue to do so,5.00,2591
man this is the one album that i did not dig at first but after multiple play i finally realize that this is a great album no it is not one of the greatest albums of all time not even in the top 25 not even in my top 5 greatest 90s albums but it is a damn great album airbag5 paranoid android5 best song on here subterranean homesick alien45 one song that i love playing so much exit music35 bit overrated let down45 karma police4 fitter happierna electionerring45 climbing up the wall4 no surprises5 lucky45 the tourist4 ave441,4.50,528
what is it takes to someone to does not like ok computer to be a total ass i understand these guys who said that this album sucks simply you have a aweful taste of music because only people with level like radiohead people who feels music who enjoy listen to good sounds not just shake their head like an idiot or listen to pop music and crap so i respect the guys who doest like it i feel shame for them this is one of the greatest albums of history this is one of the greatest bands of history nothing left to say,5.00,515
part of me really does not want to like this album just because of its immense popularity but it annoys me too say that it deserves it brilliant stuff,4.00,150
overjoyed when this beat revolver to the top spot this album is really something each song features the right balance of rock electronica and ambience the first three tracks are strong efforts the loveable airbag the labyrinthine paranoid android and the space rock subterranean homesick alien these pass off as standard radiohead you know the general mix of quirky ideas and twisted melodies that sort of thing that sort of radiohead however these next three songs are nigh on perfect exit music for a film is pure heaven a troubled extremely powerful movement with heavy use on dynamics and odd instrument sounds let down is pure beauty recorded at 3am in some dead actresss mansion it captures the night time atmosphere completely imagine waking up in the middle of the night on a motorway and seeing all the lights dancing around in their individual soulful sensations and karma police is the last of the perfect tunes until you reach no surprises lucky and the tourist not that any of the other songs are by any means bad despite filler fitter happier each sporting their own similar yet completely unique personalities but it is just the final three are spotless splash out a bit get the amazing second disc as well if only for polyethylene which is even better than most songs on the first disc,4.50,1301
a masterpiece in the form of an ode to everyday life it is dangerous to analyze this album as it could easily limit it but if i were to refer to ok computer by one phrase it would be contemporary apocalyptic melancholy art,5.00,222
good album somewhat pretentious but undeniably ranked among the best of the 1990s despite its qualities it is difficult to understand its immense popularity here at rym best album of all time strikes me as an unforgivable exaggeration it probably will not age with the same force and will look like a latecentury dark side of the moon melancholy full of hypnotic harmonies and beautiful if monotonous,3.50,400
the music is great but the vocals make my ears bleed and totally detract from what could have been a great listening experience,3.00,127
it distresses me that this is the 1 album on this site i like karma police a lot but other than that i really think it is a terrible album i have listened to it close to 10 times trying to get it to click but it just has not as it is i could probably list 200 albums that are better than this,0.50,292
1 for 1997  1 overall so it is official now is not it not a surprise i guess since there are lots of records in the top 100 that i just do not rate that highly as for this one to say it is not as groundbreaking or innovative or even consistent and well written as people are led to believe would be insignificant next to the fact that it  obviously  speaks to so many of them personally i guess i am just going to have to accept that but ok computer is not the piper at the gates of dawn for christs sake 710,3.50,508
some of the bands best work is clearly visible in this album paranoid android and let down are two of their greatest songs,4.50,122
you know i thought it was a 5 too but that is because i have not listen to their other works like kid a and amnesiac do not get me wrong i love this album but it seemed too rock for me it really seemed like they wanted to change but their record company did not let them do so so they made it progressive rock,4.00,309
a good album but how anybody can rate it above the bends or pablo honey is beyond me it is a bit like the elbow phenomenan how can anybody really rate their later albums as better then their first maybe if they have not listened to them,4.00,236
classique enough has been said this is the moodiest album my generation has produced maybe other than liars drums not dead but nothing compares the sound is unmatched and cannot be recognized that is what makes it part of the canon and that is why radiohead are the beatles of my time,4.50,284
is this radioheads best album that is tough to say if it is not ok computer it is kid a for completely different reasons ok computer perfected radioheads grandiose rock style while kid a opened vast new musical horizons for them to explore i will say that ok computer is an easier listen than kid a and an album that you tire of less quickly the progression of songs is intelligent and focused minus fitter happier i guess every song is a highlight but if i were to try and name my faves i would say lucky paranoid android airbag exit music,5.00,540
after debuting with the bends album britpop oriented and highly influenced by british invasion bands radiohead peak with ok computer in their first and best foray into indie electronic music still influenced by later english bands paranoid android was highly inspired in the beatles happiness is a warm gun and even queens bohemian rapsody ok computer set the standard for modern postmid90s rock and roll,5.00,404
incredibly beautiful yet also dark and depressing at the same time lots of raw emotion coming from thom yorke the guitar work on this album sounds like a modern day electric ladyland in how ahead of its time it was when it came out the best tracks from the album i thought would probably be paranoid android subterranean homesick alien twisted namepossible weird out there cover of the classic bob dylan song or at least a reference to it lol karma police climbing up the walls lucky and no surprises so excellent album with a lot of room to grow on you as you listen deeper,5.00,574
one of the best albums of the 90s and probably top 20 of all time much praise is heaped on it for the concept and the beautiful sonic landscape that unify the tracks but that is all for naught if there is not genuinely good songwriting underneath ok computer has several great songs exit music for a film  great paranoid android  great subterranean homesick alien  great lots of artists have spent all their time in the studio meticulously crafting every little sound on their album from waves of distortion to the tiniest little chime but after the third listen you realize that it is just a house of cards luckily that is not the case here it is worth the hype,5.00,662
is there anything left to be said about this one landmark album of the 90s favorite tracks airbag lucky paranoid android,5.00,120
i once reviewed this and then i took down the review this is the type of record that i adored when i was younger i still like it but i cannot seem to get as much into it as i used to i probably should give it a couple of more spins and try i am still young but it just is not the same somehow even though it is still good i am definitely not a grownup i refuse to believe that,2.50,376
unfortunately rym cannot have a 82 star review perfect my favorites 1 airbag 2 paranoid android 3 subterranean homesick alien 4 exit music for a film 5 let down 6 karma police 7 fitter happier 8 electioneering 9 climbing up the walls 10 no surprises 11 lucky 12 the tourist but especially tracks 12356810 and 12,5.00,311
ranked 1 for 1997  1 overall jesus is this overrated come on a record with subterranean homesick alien on it is not the best ever boy is that song dull same with climbing up the walls although it did grow on me everywhere else is perfect exit music for a film may be the most underrated song ever and the fisrt couple songs are classic alt songs let us get to subterranean homesick alien i could write this come on man mabey the folks who love it would be blown away with the first 2 and forget about this one karma police is a beatle rip but a good one indeed and electioneering is a hard rock killer even the tourist is epic i have to say its overrated again but buy it buy it,4.50,678
first seven songs and the tourist are top notch but i feel what is in between are weaker in comparison electioneering itself takes half a star away for killing the atmosphere and mood the album was setting up it feels completely out of place here,4.00,246
airbags carrier riff is one of the finest things in life the best song raidohead ever composed,4.50,94
an amazing album paranoid android has to be my favorite song definitely one of the great albums of all time,5.00,107
i have two options 1 omg best album evar yah  in other words five stars 2 dude number 2 wat  in other words one star with the first option i am a victim of hype with the second option i am an immature little prick that gives a damn about such things i just have one question is not music allowed to be beautiful anymore is anything that does not wail in your ears inoffensive i am not in a position to ponder such things and if i were to i probably would not care all i know is this here album is real purrty five stars,5.00,519
i really like this album a lot of classic moments here are a little ruined by some boring moments but with so much good moments inside this is considered a classic that will be kept in my collection forever wow so many highlights here this radiohead guys know what they are doing i especiially like karma police no surprisesa perfect song exit music tourist and paranoid android and with so many amazing moments an album can be called a classic,4.50,444
to publish such an album on my birthday is a great gift for me and for all the fans of the group well done,4.00,106
a great great album although not to be labelled a classic it is indeed a fine example of music that can appeal to diferent tastes and tribes the vocals are really good and the depressing feel of the album makes it for a nice nocturne experience,4.00,244

one of my all time favorite albums a perfect example of the alientation in the age of machinery,5.00,95
ah radiohead before they completely went from rock to rockelectronic these alternative rock pioneers never let down,5.00,115
i was far more impressed with it in 97 than i am now good songs but very depressing the crazed electioneering is easily the best cut to these ears it is actually been compared to dark side of the moon but lacks the cohesion and development of that classic i guess it is one for the computerinternet generation though,3.50,316
good airbag paranoid android subterranean homesick alien good exit music for a film good let down pretty karma police good fitter happier pretty good electioneering good climbing up the walls no surprises good lucky good the tourist,3.50,232
ok computer works so damn well because it exists in a world that does not seem to work at all overarching themes of suburban malaise alienation and technology run amok in the most yawn inducing ways notwithstanding this album is simply a collection of twelve incredible songs yes even the spoken word interlude of fitter happier which compresses the above mentioned themes into two succinct minutes incessant touring and hectic recording schedules forced radiohead to become quick learners at both and all their talent and skill come out in songs like the multisuite paranoid android the slowboiling exit music and the u2conquering lucky an album that consistently rewards repeat listenings sleigh bells in airbag white noise on climbing up the walls a gorgeous jonny greenwood solo at the end of the tourist thom yorkes singing on let down okc seems no less relevant and powerful twelve years after its release many of the songs were written on acoustic guitar and simply experimented upon in endless ways onstage and in the studio it is a testament to the bands ability to be simple and complex at the same time along with lyrics that are similarly ominous and ambiguous the backlash in some spheres is inevitable but popular music millions of copies sold worldwide has never been this experimental melodic and  dare i say it  fun at the same time,5.00,1349
when i first heard ok computer i was completely oblivious to the hype and praise surrounding it i was looking up bands that i had heard of on a review site called wilson and alroy one day and radiohead just happened to pop into my head and this album was the one with the highest ratings the first few times i listened to the album i was never amazed but i liked it especially climbing up the walls and electioneering now i can honestly say my relationship with the album is simply strange every time i give it a score over a 4 i feel like i am overrating it and every time i give it a score under a 4 i feel like i am underrating it i know every note by heart and yet i feel like i do not fully understand it it feels like both a concept album and a natural soundtrack to modern life it is both creepy and energizing exit music for a film yet mellow and relaxing exit music for a film i get a lot out of this album and yet i never define it as a personal favorite probably because i only listen to it every now and then when i think about it i really do not understand how i remember every single note it just sounds so familiar and natural maybe one day i will just go allout and give it a 45,4.00,1194
ok computer is easily the best record in my collection not that big yet unfortunately seriously not a weak song on the album with the exception of perhaps fitter happier especially awesome tracks in my opinion would be airbag paranoid android exit music and lucky admittely it can be quite depressing at times but if your in the right mood it is great never have i heard an album that is so ridiculously moving and so musically strong on almost every single track the lyrics are great too especially on karma police and this is coming from someone who does not usually give a crap about lyrics,5.00,593
this is a decent record paranoid android is a fantastic song and much of the rest of it holds up however it is let down by fitter happier and electioneeringplus it is hard to listening to it from start to finish without feeling very tired thanks to the lack of excitement contained within,3.50,288
this is a really great album and yet somehow my first listen to this was nearly 10 years after its initial release  and from a position of great speculation i have never been one to test out records that immediately break into the mainstream but this website has been something of an inspiration for good records in the past and so i thought i would try it out this test paid off and pushed me into a position of great respect for a band which i would have never bothered with otherwise having owned the bends since my youth i never expected this band would have released an album with such ambition as is revealed on ok computer with each song you can almost feel the will to experiment and grow the only low point of the album i can highlight is possibly electioneering which is a little too vanilla indierock for my liking otherwise the whole album really does showcase radioheads yearning to expand their horizons in a very interesting way fitter happier is apparently not a crowd pleaser and yet to me it is even further proof of this top picks of the album again  hard to choose but i suppose the moments i really enjoy the most happen during paranoid android subterranean homesick alien let down and climbing up the walls,4.50,1228
i do not think i am saying anything new about it just that it is the best album i have got,5.00,90
so number 1 on rym i guess there could be a better choice but having said that ok computer is not bad album on the contrary  it is excellent i can understand some people does not like it for being overhyped i guess that is the right term i have been there in 97 there was too much hype for my taste so i had some aversion towards it i knew those first two singles which were good but i could not understand the fuss about the album then a couple months later the radio show that was absent for almost a year was back on the air and on the first show they played ok computer i was so thrilled the show was back and i recorded the album minus few songs on a cassette and decided to try to listened to it to see is it any good it could not do any harm after i have listened to it a couple times maybe around five i have got that great feeling when you realize something good is going on and ok computer is beyond those two singles with subterranean homesick alien the album started to unfold while i started to enjoy it more and more a month later i have found burnt  so called bulgarian cd at the local store and bought it immediately so i could enjoying it properly next year or so the album was on my top 10 albums but as the time has passing by it started to be slightly less appealing large part of it was due to the overplaying it on my player since then circa 99 i have been playing it significantly less than i used to and album slowly departed my top 10 and later also top 66 albums today i am listening to it rarely once or twice a year but every time when i am listening to it ok computer reminds me how actually good this album is and how i used to enjoying it so strong 45 stars is a nobrainer,4.50,1703
temas destacados paranoid android let down karma police electioneering climbing up the wall no surprises,5.00,104
fitter happier is a bit too long and electioneering is a little generic the rest is classic rock,5.00,96
i give this album 1 star for no suprises which is goodcould care less about the rest,1.00,84
classicblah blah etc etc do not like subterranean homesick blues and that is the third song so it brings this record down from perfection quickly,4.50,145
discazo many people say that after the bends they lost their gripfor me radiohead counts from this albumi would even say that the sound of ok computer is the new new from 97 rock sound  it is true that the whole album except airbag has a quite depressing atmosphere and the lyrics when you understand them it was hard for me talk about reality in a perhaps too crude way but that is the best thing about the album it defines society and ourselves in an amazing depressing but accurate way the best thing about the album obviously if i give it a 5 it is because the whole album seems perfect to me but to highlight some paranoid android for me the best of the band and if you like j greenwood in electrionering it is lights,5.00,722
a mess of good songs thrown helplessly together into what feels more like a compilation than an album thankfully radiohead got themselves straight with kid a to follow,2.50,167
if there was a piece of music that came out of my generation that i would consider a masterpiece it would be ok computer the unique musical genius from this band shines thorughout the whole album they are going to be remembered as legends they already got a good start now all i can say is that it is a classic and is one of my top favorites recommend it to almost anybody,5.00,372
ok computer simply is the anxious selfimportant uncertain technologically overwhelmed 1990s thus wrote a pitchfork critic in an attempt to crystallize the essence of this much lauded record to me however radioheads musical pinnacle does not sound steeped in a certain decade  twelve years later it works as a great soundtrack to the noughties as well and most probably will continue to have a compelling effect on future generations i first laid my ears on ok computer in 2005 while being a foot deep in the middle of an appreciation period for old school progressive rock consequently it was an odd record to listen to at first not overwhelmingly weird or difficult mind you butmodern i could hear traces of pink floyd which i later found out was a common phenomenon among listeners still for all the faint pink floyd vibes it most certainly was not art rock in the triedandtested 70s fashion ok computer clearly was a musical animal all on its own drawing from influences yes but in the process creating that rare specimen of a record a piece of work that will resonate across cultural barriers and through the ages it firmly drew me in listen by listen it wrapped me in its layered beats in its eery and stirring yet strangely enticing soundscapes mainly created by the rich and imaginative use of guitar textures and their juxtaposition with thom yorkes sweetly lamenting vocals this music seemingly depressing to many ears out there was and continues to be one of the purest most invigorating emotionladen musical rides for me at the risk of sounding like a silly fangirl i will go so far as to say that my inner being seems to ebb and flow to the beat melody and execution of these eleven meticulously crafted songs and no more so than during exit music let down and lucky a chemical reaction if there ever was one in an attempt to crystallize the essence of one of the greatest records of our time even further than our pitchfork critic at the beginning of this review i will only say this ok computer simplyis,5.00,2017
the first album i owned at an early age the real influence of this album passed me by although i felt i appreciated that what i was hearing was very different to me the real wave of impact this album caused me was felt about 5 or 6 years after originally acquiring it and oh how it has changed my perspective of music forever,5.00,325
if you do not like the album it is because you are deaf you like to go against it or maybe you are not western p,5.00,112
i have listen this album and it still being the best work of radiohead it represent the beggining of the 21st century,5.00,117
so different from their next album but so good in its own way,5.00,61
fantastic bleak relentless music it feels like the start of a rock revolution that never happened full of fresh ideas kick ass guitar and great atmosphere the first album of the 21st century is how i like to think of it,5.00,219
it still does not deserve the second album of all time,4.50,54
well i finally listened to it the album that is supposedly the greatest or one of album of all time did it live up to it is hype unfortunately no however i will say that this is a very enjoyable album just not worthy of all the 5star ratings that have been constantly handed to it the album starts out pretty good with airbag being a rocking opening and then it rolls into paranoid android which is a song that i consider to be one of the greatest in the bands vast catelog exit music for a film is painfully average until the last minute or so then it becomes epic it is a shame it could not have been that good throughout the whole song let down is indeed a bit of a let down but karma police immediately makes up for it it is such a beutiful song and right up there with fake plastic trees and idioteque as far as being the bands most emotional songs electioneering is another decent rock song while climbing up the walls and no surprises bring the album to a more mellow sound the last two songs are also very good with the tourist making an excellent album closer so there it is is it the greatest album ever made absolutely not is it the genredefying masterpiece that everyone claims it is nope still do not think so butit is a very good arty rock album even if it is majorly overhyped personally i think that radiohead really found their mark with kid a and amnesiac but that is just me 1 airbag  355 2 paranoid android  55 3 subterranean homesick alien  355 4 exit music for a film  55 5 let down  45 6 karma police  55 7 fitter happier  na 8 electioneering  45 9 climbing up the walls  55 10 no surprises  455 11 lucky  455 12 the tourist  45,5.00,1651
if in 1997 there were still many people who did not pay attention to radioheads every move things quickly changed with the release of ok computer an indefinable unquestionable record it is a summary in twelve tracks of almost all the contributions given by the english band to world rock which also translates into what was copied by thousands of groups that tried to recapture part of the magic of a single album  admittedly the first half of the record is more overwhelmingly impressive than the second which is made all the more evident by the fact that it begins with an expendable chatter track that highlights the worst aspects of the bands artistic bent including one of the most badass album openings in history with the beautiful airbag and the epic paranoid android declaring to everyone that here was the apex of the guys career probably the biggest merit of the record is to expand rock to previously unthinkable limits without it feeling forced calculated or cold ok computer is one of those rare cases where the sound evolution of an entire genre happens naturally almost spontaneously depending only on the genius of a team of musicians and in these cases it is truly impossible and useless to try to resist,4.50,1222
definitely overpriced excellent album but relatively waaay overpriced i prefer the bends and pablo honey,4.50,104
simply one of the best albums ever written for everyone who enjoys it i recommend panikon by grimus ,5.00,100
rym makes a big fuss about this one but let us skip the second greatest recording of all times part and get to the point when i simply say i like it sometimes it gets little arty and pensive but it is passable and after that bend it gets amusing,4.50,245
recommend airbag paranoid android let down karma police climbing the walls and lucky this album has proven to be a grower for me it took me a while to get into it but eventually i did and i realized it is greatness for recreating paranoiddour rock music sort of in the vain of pink floyd the first time i heard it i did not understand the importance of each track and so fitter happier would often get skipped but even i notice this track now has a significant place and meaning on the album that cannot be ignored this is the perfect alienation paranoia of the future album and once one gets in the appropriate mind set it can be damn near impossible to not be awed by it radiohead simply reinvented a genre of rock music that had almost been forgotten the world over and even now in early 2009 its message of mistrusting technology is still relevant oh yeah the music is astoundingly spacey in feel it almost seems unearthly perhaps it was see subterranean homesick alien,4.00,973
some classic stuff here one of the top albums of all time i think not though radioheads following might qualify as one of the most rabid of all time much as i love about 23 of the tracks here fitter happier and the tourist are really pretty shamefully bad this might be the last record on which radiohead displays any sort of a sense of humor or even humorous cynicism,4.00,368
this is one of my 5 favourite albums and is probably the defining work of the 90s this albums is a piece of art in every way especially in the way that the uneducated ear cannot quite listen to the amazing complexity and beautiful singing of thom yorke the album starts where the bends kind of is rocky and anthemic but at the same time powerful and artistic with airbag also appearing on airbaghow is my driving ep in a slightly different format it then plunges into what is the unrelenting epic of paranoid android possibly the best song on the album it then moves sound to a numb pace with subterranean homesick alien and exit music for a film the latter having a haunting twist with yorke singing we hope that you choke a far less ghostly but still as numb and beautiful track is let down the track karma police well deserves it is place as one of radioheads top singles a brilliant song that shows electronic experimentation linking with archaic instrumentalism the neutrality of the song fitter happier eludes to the great genius of radiohead one of the final reposes of the anthemic side of radiohead is shown in electioneering a classic rock track in an a very 1990s form climbing up the walls is another one of those numb strange and almost drugged tracks it then leads to the most beautiful song on the album some say depressing others say strangely hopeful but it can be agreed it is certainly a lethargic track but nonetheless one of the most amazing songs of the 90s the mood swings once more to numbness and tiredness but it can be seen that this time it seems more controlled lucky moves to one of those notorious jonny greenwood album finishing tracks the tourist is a smooth beautiful song that has a truly intense feel,5.00,1736
considered possibly the most important album of the decade but besides all of that i still liked it i hold strong loyalties to their previous the bends but this was an incredible follow up to say the least significant innovations in sound and concept from the start with airbag and it is distorted drums and effects then the fantastically involved paranoid android became an instant classic radiohead masterpiece as it opens into thom yorkes falsetto verse over the beautifully unique rhythmic atmosphere that this band is so great at instantly screaming into heavy guitars then sailing across an air of beautiful vocals arriving onto a heavy handed closing a couple of tracks later is maybe the most emotional song the band has ever recorded exit music is the most incredible portrayal of desperate escape that i have ever heard in music it is still an event that brings the world to a stand still as it reaches a disturbing heartwrenching climax in the last section and of course karma police is a statement from my own soul to the rest of the world i must thank them for saying it so well the next 3 tracks keep this from being a perfect album for me the computer generated fitter happier goes on to long electioneering is a loud piece that has little direction and the distorted vocal on climbing the walls spoils the mood set by the other tracks but then i love the final 3 tracks from the ironic no surprises the atmospheric lucky and the appropriate closer the tourist it is still tough to rate an albums value even a decade away but i will agree on the landmark position this one is placed if it was only more complete then i would launch it to the heights as well,4.50,1672
at first time i listened to this album i did not understand why it was so cool but later listening twice i figured out that this is one of the best albums on my library because it contains such a great variety in each song good lyrics and excelent production work it is definetly the the dark side of the moon of the 90s well done radiohead,5.00,340
i actually think this is a bit overrated so why the five star rating it seems a bit daft but it is the best album of all time talk that gets me i think there are many better records out there even if this is right up there still there is no denying this a superbly constructed art rock record that captured its time so perfectly that it did not seem likely they could possibly do it again a mere three years later ridiculous prog breakdowns in paranoid android stadium classic in the form of karma police and simply tender compositions in the vein of lucky very talented men at work simply put but still no lifechanger for me,5.00,625
i was quite surprised that this was the second highest rated album on rym but at the same time quite glad even if it does not necessarily deserve it it is probably not the second greatest album of all time but i honestly believe it is not far off for years too much weight has been put on the great classics of the 60s and 70s and very often deservedly so but nevertheless we are all eager for a new wave of true masterpieces and with the help of mtv and numerous others we just have not seen that in the last 25 years or so there have been a few great ones some left field classics but even the most balanced critics will agree that the output of amazing music is simply not as high as it once was and there is defenitely not one reason for it and we could be debating why forever radiohead and in turn ok computer did not start that new wave of masterpieces but if one album should have in the last quarter of a century it is this i am not going to summarize the music because it is been done so many times before  i will simply say that it is one of the greatest album efforts of all time and it is about time we see more of these here is to a new generation of rock classics  may it come soon,5.00,1196
why god why why does everyone like this album so much i am sorry radiohead fans i like the same kind of music as you i like pink floyd i like arcade fire i like the mars volta but i find absolutely nothing appealing about this album i honestly cannot see whatever it is that other people see in this album none of the instrumentalism is particularly impressive nor is the lyricism nor is thom yorkes voice which actually gets on my nerves pretty substantially because you cannot understand a word he is saying i listened to this album the entire way through several times because i really wanted to like it and the only track i found even moderately entertaining was karma police but even that just feels like it lacks substance pink floyd makes the experimentalpsychedelic concept album work because their riffs are memorable and their lyrics are worthy of singing in the shower in other words they are accessible and while some people may criticize accessibility in a band claiming that it means they are too mainstream or that they have sold out i find it an absolute must have for me to appreciate a band in essence what radiohead has done here is create an paradoxical album that is difficult to listen to but requires several full listens to comprehend the only reason i would ever listen to this album again is because of it is reputation  i feel like i am missing something but no matter how many times i listen to ok computer i never find it two stars best track karma police,2.00,1484
ok computer creates an atmosphere between melancholy and anger that hits you in the depths of your feelings through their lyrics and melodies radioheads guitars are full of feelings that instead of seem played by human beings they seem played by aliens this could only be possible in the 90s since airbag until the tourist the album is a trip that reflects various themes always searching out the depths of the heart thom yorkes voice is unique and in conjunction with all the instruments of the band and the album production stands out even more in addition the booklet that accompanies the album is almost surreal ok computer born in an era of searching the 90s was the era where rock had found new ways especially with alternative rock that decade between the dancepop of the 80s and the garage rock revival n almost indie rock of the 2000s this means that the alternative rock gets to the top and the award was won by ok computer in 1997 after almost 20 years still it should keep that privilege i hope never be surpassed,5.00,1025
i mean ya it is a good album no surprises is a pretty great song i have always liked exit music good album but i really do not like it as much as i used to,4.00,155
ok i can see why this is rated so high i absolutely hate this kind of melancholic music but this one is so mild and leaves me with such a nice feeling that i can say it is very good without any regret nice job,3.50,209
i suppose i just do not get this album yet hopefully i will sometime and i will appreciate it is true genius hopefully and when that time comes i will update this review but right now as it stands i find this album to be very mediocre nothing that special if you want an amazing radiohead abum listen to the bends highlights airbag paranoid android exit music karma police,4.00,372
nothing really genius though level of a quality raised fairly high electioneering probably their best song ever for it is candid anger and respective powerful guitar parts,3.50,171
id like to think there is music which i dont enjoy but which i believe is good maybe dylan would qualify but then again i think i enjoy the best pieces of blonde on blonde  the first word that came to mind is mediocre but its not that not at all i suppose that the words are excellent even if i cant make them out in the noise but musically this does not touch me in any way also it does not strike me as brilliant  there is one good song but not one bit of rockn roll here ps theres also music that i enjoy even if i think its not good one thing i understand they are striving for something big guess i have to come back to this one as i have heard this only a few times  but i do not look forward to it   1111  111  11111 run while you still can the wolves are around the corner yes they are and theyare going to eat you any day now this is going to be alltime 1 its a generation thing  the stone roses too were voted 1 somewhere ten years after  how ridiculous but it is the generation of machines the machines are going to take over and it is the end the end of the song its skin the single died a long time ago and im someone who loves loveless,2.50,1149
pretty good album i loved it when i first heard it but that wore off pretty quickly  far quicker than the supposed 2nd best album of all time ever should just allow me to offer some perspective here this album is supposedly better than every bowie album televisions marquee moon pet sounds by the beach boys doolittle by the pixies forever changes by love every stooges album every velvet underground album every joy division release nearly every beatles album bar revolver every rolling stones who kinks and dylan album every hendrix neil young and john lennon album this is a good record like ocean rain by echo and the bunnymen is a good album like chutes too narrow by the shins is a good album like too bring you my love by pj harvey is a good album i think even radiohead have better albums than this and i think they would be slightly embarrassed to be ranked higher than the assembled legends of rock i do not think it is an all time great but it is a decent record they should have buried fitter happier though because that diabolically bad diatribe dates ok computer badly and after all everyone knows that the classics are supposed to be timeless,3.50,1157
one of my favourite albums fitter happier and electioneering are lesser songs but the other ten are pure genius,5.00,111
review 1213 and sitting at 437 from 12915 at this point i do not feel i need to explain why i have this at rated so highly i do not need to explain that this is radioheads masterpiece an album that touches the lives of everyone that hears it or one of the greatest albums of the 90s or of all time what i will say is that i think everyone needs to stop reading reviews if you have never heard this album and just listen to it love it or hate it odds say you will love it i think everyone should hear an album that has so personally touched so many people go lastfm or whatever you need to do just listen in the neon sign scrolling up and down i am born again ambition makes you look pretty ugly kicking and squealing gucci little piggy i would tell all my friends but they would never believe they would think that i would finally lost it completely we hope that you choke that you choke i am going to grow wings a chemical reaction hysterical and useless karma police arrest this girl her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill fitter healthier and more productive a pig in a cage on antibiotics riot shields voodoo economics it is just business open up your skull i will be there climbing up the walls a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruises that will not heal kill me sarah kill me again with love it is going to be a glorious day hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down,4.50,1420
i cannot believe i have not heard it for 10 years after all this is a masterpiece if do not have thisyou would better buy it as soon as possible,5.00,144
too freaking clean still airbag is the perfect opener the paranoid android solo is the angriest thing in the world let down is cute climbing up the walls is positively creepy etc i endorse the use of this album,0.50,210
there is not much i have got left to say about ok computer you know for so many people have rated this album above the moon it is true it could not be much better maybe one bad thing i can say about it is that it is a little bit too blue i guess the bends got enough happiness then anyways yes the best album of 1990s favorite songs climbing up the walls the tourist let down,5.00,375
half the best album ever made half a portent of things to come,3.00,62
the speed bump in their prolific yet flawfilled career this is i am going to one of those flaws even though it has a few classics which are mostly the slower ones the bends kid a and in rainbows may not be better albums but i like them more you should definitely listen because most major publications think you are missing something if you have not yet highlights paranoid android let down karma police no surprises the tourist least favorites electioneering,3.50,459
the album ok komputer is considered by many to be the best album in rock history i cannot say it because i have not heard all the rock albums but i can say that along with his successor kid a is the best album in radioheads discography more balanced slowed down music with electronic inserts which together with the guitar dynamics will be the basis for kid a creates an amazing depressiveobsessive atmosphere unheard of before on previous radiohead albums album ok computer is recognize for many people as the best rock album ever i cannot say that because i did not hear all rock albums but i can say that with next one kid a is the best album in their discography more weigh slow down music with electronics parts which with guitar dynamic will be basic for the kid a create amazing depressive  obsessive mood which i never meet on previous albums ps sorry for my english i am on my way to be better  cb,4.50,906
there is something paradoxical about ok computer the music itself is so good that as far as i am concerned it is more or less perfect yet i do not actually feel very happy about this since the songs and more generally the tone of the album have left me somewhat depressed because of this i do not know whether or not to recommend it however there is no doubt in my mind that this is radioheads masterwork and one of the most striking sound environments i have yet to experience the shear consistency of quality alone is enough to make this an easy purchase for better or for worse this album is special,4.50,602
the first radiohead album i heard it influenced me to get into the rest of there music and bands like them its an anchor of late 90s early 2000s rock and roll fitter happier is very strange but the computer voice has a sad sort of feeling to it only radiohead could make a computer have emotion,4.00,294
i do not see any reason why some think this is overrated if an album deserves 5 stars that is not overrating it is called common sense by the way i owned this and it is a must have,5.00,180
well i decided my old review was far too cheesy because quite simply i cannot describe my love for radiohead not to mention ok computer into words i can use adjectives such as mindblowing majestic etc but still these are pretty mild for the exceptional effort that is ok computer of course you have heard this all before but you can hear it again 1 airbag 55 2 paranoid android 3 subterranean homesick alien 55 4 exit music for a film 5 let down 55 6 karma police 7 fitter happier unrated 8 electrioneering 35 9 climbing up the walls 55 10 no surprises 11 lucky 12 the tourist average 483 1 greatest songs ever 6 cover art great overall 55 what else is there to give this album,5.00,677
the album to end all albums,5.00,27
i will probably catch some heat from my buddies for not rating this higher i can appreciate the fact that ok computer introduced me to a fresh and new direction of music when it came out on most of the tracks i find myself listening to the great interplay between the instruments the music is definitely atypical i love the tempo changes in some of the songs as well as the occasional dissonance the problem i have with radiohead is the vocals i do not find enough contrast in the vocal style range tempo to keep my attention i understand that the sad bastard music radiohead so often promotes needs thoms voice to complete the music but i do not like the lazy approach to singing so many alternative bands take i sometimes get sick of the same slow style of their music for some reason i do not like many of the popular songs off this album i do not particularly like paranoid android but like exit music the tourist and lucky i can enjoy radiohead in small doses but i would not recommend this album overrated i do not know i understand that it is a very popular album among many many people however i think radiohead is not an elite band if they cross the generation gap which i have yet to see in large amount i might be persuaded to think otherwise,2.50,1253
after hearing all the hype over this album i thought that i would try it however i was very disappointed it lacked in that special something that i want from my music it failed to make me feel anything like the early works of mcfly that rouses something deep inside me whereas this merely made me mildly hungry however i had not actually had breakfast yet so it may not have been the raising for my aching belly i struggled to understand the lyrics the style in which this guy sings really masks what he is trying to say it is nothing on the crisp vocal of someone like hanson which allows me to hear the deep and heartwrenching emotion driving their music whereas with this i am sure of whether there is any emotional stuff i can really get behind and cry over and stuff,0.50,771
of course i am not very original in placing this album on the first place but it would appear that such beauty is universally recognized from the first notes of airbag to the final bell tinkling at the end of the tourist are they connected this album is a scary yet very very beautiful description of modern life highlights are the climax of let down which sends shivers down your spine every time you hear it the moment the guitars come shimmering through in the tourist and hell all of it really you probably all know what i am talking about and if you do not go listen to it until you do,5.00,590
edgy and atmospheric and always on the edge of having their heads disappear up their own backsides radiohead unveil their masterpiece if only they would stopped here,4.00,165
this album makes me happy to be alive,5.00,37
the atmosphere that emanates from this masterpiece is one of the most intricate dichotomies i have encountered so far depressing yet joyous the lyrics are overwhelmingly negative singing about computers consuming humanity a narrator repeatedly hoping a character chokes and overwhelmingly desolate loneliness the music however is consuming and atmospheric like a white cloud that hides reality and creates an alternate and intricate reality the first dozens listens through this album last fall generally got me depressed but nowadays i find that it sometimes is uplifting even though exit music is one of the saddest songs i have heard in my life the variety and flow really completes this album climbing up the walls and let down convey two completely different emotions an most of the songs fit right after another with the exception of electioneering which breaks up the atmosphere for better or for worse,4.50,909
a record that has lost nothing for me after many years the pure genius of tracks such as electioneering paranoid android exit music for a film is there glaring and evident as soon as i put my earphones on and start listening here is the strength of this group a drum that already sounds wonderful the touch is almost jazzy you feel that the rhythm section will undergo changes and somehow it will arrive somewhere else one day not very far away the electronics the pieces with the modified voices and the almost jazz  avantgarde passages are there ready for even more massive use but this is an extraordinary record also because you can forget for a moment that karma police and no surprises will also arrive two classic ballads two intense and extraordinary pieces karma police is indebted to a beatlesian opening then it goes without saying that it becomes one of the key pieces of the 90s no surprises splendid lullaby that reconciles nightmares let us say but i did not remember her so beautiful and then again the turist climbing up the walls slide one after the other and the disc ends if he still plays it with kid a for the disc scepter that i like most and convinces me of the yorke team but it is without a doubt the one i am most attached to also because he introduced them to me,5.00,1290
this album is a rock gem each note of this album is thought out nothing is superfluous for me this album revolutionized the face of rock which was looking for itself after the explosion in full flight of grunge,5.00,210
ok computer is still a great album but it does not match the bends in my opinion paranoid android and karma police are two of radioheads best songs but the whole album seems a little less exciting than its predecessor airbag 810 paranoid android 1010 subterranean homesick alien710 karma police1010 let down710 exit music610 the tourist6510 fitter happier310 no suprises810 lucky7510 electioneering7510 climbing down the wall8510,4.00,429
is there a sixth star better than joshua tree or nevermind this is the best record since london calling,5.00,103
first a confession ok computer brought me back to rock music deceived from the spontaneous death of shoegazing my bloody valentine and stone rosess new albums were not coming out lush and curve could not produce a good first album chapterhouse ride happy mondays slowdive catherine wheel and many more were just brain dead the end of the pixiesbreeders the boring supremacy of grunge etc i met a friend who initiated me to classical music and to the joys of listening to music on a perfoming hifi system try tallis spem in alium sang by huelgas ensemble why dead can dance when there is the real middle ages why cocteau twins if classical divas have solid singing technique any rock experiment was instantly tagged useless and already done better in classical music by that new friend that i must thank because he still had opened my eyes to new kind of music which was after all a crucial event in my life then a revelation so i discovered ok computer everybody was talking about it and i was curious the depressive ballads impressed me from the first listening i even thought that rock music had reached its age of maturity with radiohead  and it took about 5 more years before classical music left the place slowly but surely to its younger brother rocky finally the history of rock was a lot more complex rich and vast than i imagined and that would remain the true revelation of the last years,4.00,1398
this album was a bit of a let down honestly airbag and paranoid android are a stellar onetwo punch showing us what radiohead can do with the progressive rock soundand they are great but most of the rest of the album falls flatthe best songs here are the ones that sound the most desperate let down no surprises and lucky are great songs let down has the most splendid outro i have ever heard key tracks no surprises let down paranoid android lucky,3.00,447
it is pretty brilliant that they have come out with this album especially after the bends that was so brand new and different and such a pioneer while it was filled with very great pop songs and very catchy tunes i think i only have around 10 albums on ryms all time top albums chart that i actually agree with making into the top 100 but ok computer is definitely one of them not like all the songs were great on it i mean it definitely has its low points like subterranean homesick alien but you can absolutely forgive those because the album just makes sense in its whole every song has its purpose and its rightful role everything is in its right place muhahaha so i would not change even these weaker songs on ok computer because it is just good the way it is it is how it is supposed to be i have a theory that this album managed to be so good because it is exactly on the very thin line that borders kitsch i mean no one can deny that it is dangerously close to being kitschy just think about the last epic chorus part of karma police or the kind of melodramatic exit music but it never really reaches it it always manages to keep its balance ok computer is like a perfectly elaborated plan it is endlessly smart and it has every tune and every little sound in its perfect place and yet it does not feel structured in an unnatural or artificial way in the end i think this is what makes this album so great  so there goes my kitschtheory i have another theory about radiohead and their music  or at least the lyrics  being not very personal but i am going to talk about that in my review for kid a not to ruin the mood now so to summarize it even though i kind of do not really like almost half of the songs on this album i would still agree that this is one of the greatest albums ever and not a lot of records can make me say that,4.00,1839
definitely their best album a perfect balance between the atmosphere of their later albums and their songwriting greatness of their earlier albums a great gloomy masterpiece,4.50,173
just looking at the cover already turns me on,4.50,45
there are times when i listen to a new band and cannot believe what an idiot i have been for never listening to them before radiohead was one of those bands that i had always heard so much hype about but was not sure why the few songs i had heard were ok but nothing mind blowing well how wrong i was i bought ok computer five or six weeks ago and was blown away i could not stop listening to this album i must have listened to paranoid android on my drive to and from work over forty times the album traveled from my bedroom stereo to my bathroom stereo to my living room stereo to my car stereo to my ipod for a month the only thing that got me to stop listening was when i purchased kid a well i off to continue my radiohead conquest oh by the way buy this album immediately,5.00,777
if you are a real music fan there is no way in hell you would give this album anything less then 4 stars i can understand radiohead is not everyone is cup of tea but there is no denying it is a great album overrated very much so just like the white album nevermind and dark sid of the moon are overrated as all hell but it is a great collection of brilliantly written songs that is all i expect from it do not expect it to be earth shattering or life changing because it is not and that is where this album gets alot of hatred frombecause it was sooooo overhyped do not believe the bullshit hype listen to the album yourself it is a great album the melodies are catchy as hell which also helps,5.00,693
if i had to choose one album to listen to for the rest of my life i would not hesitate to choose ok computeri saw them live in montreal last month and no one comes close to the energy of these guysjust awesome,0.50,209
what can be said new about this album surely nothing not only one of the best productions of recent decades but of the history of music itself,5.00,142
wind back to 1997 and i would have told you that music effectively died circa 1975 sure there has been the odd album that has been impressive but nothing that you would even compare to a physical graffiti who is next dsotm insert classic pre1975 album here then one day i hear about this album called ok computer and how its a classic do not make me laughor so i thought from the first note i hd the same chills i did hearing will not get fooled again on who is next with that synth looping away in the background and a windmilling guitar hovering ready to explode ok computer is not only new its different and in a good way i might add the album makes a similar statement about the world as does dsotm like dsotm this is that rare case of something being both critically acclaimed and popular indeed a rare combination everyone must own this album  it is that simple,5.00,867
i rarely rate with 5 stars an album i only do it when it proves really strong through time this is one of them i do not think radiohead will make a unique album similar to this a good amount of drugs is nor enough to make this monumental record you have to be a great musician and rediohead reached to the roof of their creativity if i had to rate these incredible songs i would say that in my opinion the best are paranoid android of course let down karma police and no surprises these four are magic but the rest are strong too definately one of the best albums of all times,5.00,576
i like this album but it is extremely overrated when i heard paranoid android before the album was released i had hopes that the rest of the album would consist of other longer more ambitious experimental songs i hear a band trying to make a difficult album to she would off the britpop skin it worked thank god they still do not suck,4.00,334
i am going down the i am flattered that someone wants to know my opinion of the probably i am sure there is a way of finding out but fucked if i know most reviewed album on earth sorry rym which i know is some peoples entire universe rather than the review my favourite album line well first off my rating of this rather fine album 5 duh i have had the immense pleasure of introducing someone to okc in 2008 as they have never listened to it in it is entirety before then omg i hear you say  were they a 90 b living in a north korean jail or c deaf up until that moment well none of them it is kind of shocking to know that some people just never bought or listened to bands like radiohead despite being really nice normal and rational human beings can you believe it but such was life when i met my boyfriend guy in 2007 i did not really understand the magnitutde of his radioheadfree existence until i took him along to see them live in june of 2008 having only being playing him in rainbows prior to said gig so he would know the new material i naively assumed he would know all the older stuff wrong said very much in a depeche mode style it was on the way home with me gushing like a 15 year old ardent fan about how amazeing they were that he mentioned it would have been nicer to know more of the songs  you had never heard airbag never you did not even know there was a radiohead album called ok computer wow this meant i had the chance to watch someone as they got to discover for the first time six radiohead albums for the first time without a the long waits between releases and b all the fucking hype apart from my own but of course my hype is better than everyone elses so there i had to go a bit carefully here of course what with the well known adage of too much of a good thing and before you say it guy is no mae west in the back of my mind and the risk of overkill so over the next year or so i introduced one album at a time allowing them to sink in and be digested and an opinion formed and just generally enjoyed so here we are a few years later did i manage to convert a former jacques brel and elbow fan into a radiohead fan yep was it me and my teenage enthusiasm or was it the music both probably but last week when radiohead announced 2 london gigs guy not only managed to get us tickets but without any suggestion got tickets for both nights what a stan and just for the record his favourite is a tie between this and hail to the thief how is that for an atypical choice love him,5.00,2507
nearest thing to a masterpiece i have heard so far  takes a few listens  but when it clicks it is orgasmic i highly recommend this,5.00,130
painfully outdated if i had heard this in 97 i would probably rave about this album but i did not 355,4.00,101
hideously overrated but still good its not the best album ever and most of the songs are seriously depressing slow and boring but somehow it works paranoid android is indeed epic,3.50,178
are radiohead the beatles of the 90s or are the beatles the radiohead of the 60s even i do not know what that means 55,5.00,118
hey this is music for smart people people who have an attention span of more than 4 songs sorry if you think i am pretentious but if you think i am sounding that way then you are dumb and just proving my point further you have to commit to this album listen to it 139 times even if you hate it one day it will click and it will be the greatest experience of your musical life i guarantee that the praise that this album gets will stop people from liking it more than they would if it did not get so much praise i do not blame them though it is something they will do sub consciously and have no control over they have weak minds not to sound like a broken record and a radiohead fanboy fuck it i am one but this is definitely one of the greatest albums ever created by human beings with blood flowing through their veins thom is one of the greatest singers ever mr greenwood is one of the most creative guitarists ever and phil lays it down on drums colin may look like a raccoon but comes from the same gene pool as jonny so that is rich the intimacy of the beginning of exit music for a film is great thanks ed obrien i could write pages about how good let down is it maybe the greatest song ever from the opening guitar notes to the cymbal crashes to the xylophone type notes that occur throughout the song to the line do not get sentimental it always ends up drivel to the build up to the final verse to the final verse to thoms singing on the final verse to the way it follows exit music it is just so fucking good so good that they do not even play it live because it can never be recreated the way it is played on the album i heard someone say once that every song on this album will at one point be your favorite song on the album one of the most true statements ever spoken sorry i could go on but i will let you decide for yourself how great this album is awwwww come on you know we are friends till we die,5.00,1916
two good songs do not make a good album i am not a fan of radiohead but they have better albums,4.00,95
excellent half a star off for a few moments where things that they have put in just do not work,4.50,95
their last one was better than this this is pretty overrated still good i guess,3.00,79
i respect this record more as an achievement than as a piece of music if you know what i am saying sonically it is brilliant it works together perfectly but you really have to commit to this record everytime you listen to it it is not just the type of record where you just kind of put on a song you like and then put on another one and sing along at the top of your lungs there is a unifying theme this is not the record to put on when you feel like listening to music though you have to actually like i said commit to listening to this record specifically favorite tracks airbag paranoid android karma police no surprises,4.00,623
this is a bullshit review but i have always associated fitter happier with the opening of gravitys rainbow so if you feel like trying that out see below  a screaming comes across the sky it has happened before but there is nothing to compare it to now it is too late the evacuation still proceeds but it is all theatre there are no lights inside the cars no lights anywhere above him lift girders old as an iron queen and glass somewhere far above that would let the light of day through but it is night he is afraid of the way the glass will fallsoonit will be a spectacle the fall of a crystal palace but coming down in total blackout pynchon,5.00,644
this really is the best radiohead album many fans will throw metaphorical stones at you if you critisize anything about radiohead but i have to admit i do not care that much for kid a or amnesiac i can recognize that there is a certain brilliance to these albums but that does not mean i ever really want to sit down and listen to them those are albums for the hardcore fan this is an album for everyone no one can deny the beauty of this album it has a great flow and you can listen to it for years without tiring of it paranoid android has to fit somewhere in the top 20 best songs ever written hail to the thief has a number of amazing songs but also a fair number of largely forgettable ones in rainbows is pleasant from beginning to end but lacks any real knockout moments ok computer is nearly all knockout moments and yet there are still songs that come across as high points exit music for a film no surprises and karma police in addition to the one i would already mentioned i almost cannot imagine there is a flaw in this album though to be fair there probably are with kid a i would advice new listeners to be cautious they may love it they may hate it i could recommend this to anyone,5.00,1196
ok so maybe this is great or fucking fantastic i think i always disliked this band because of 1 the hype which is stupid which is stupid to dislike a band for and 2 hail to the thief which is stupid which is stupid to dislike the rest of their discography for this album is fucking beautiful i am going to check out kid a and in rainbows after this,5.00,348
airbag  paranoid android12 subterranean homesick alien12 exit music for a film  let down 12 karma police  fitter happier 12 electioneering  climbing up the walls  no surprises  lucky 12 the tourist average song rating 429 i remember being pissed at robert christgau for giving this album a bi mean how could he call my favorite album which i considered a peak of emotional catharsis in songwriting emotionally dead i partially agreelisten to in the aeroplane over the seathat is emotion but does that make this work of less significance in terms of sheer emotion no hell no these lyrics are amazing no seriously i overlooked the lyrics at first airbag wow the lyrics are pretty great despite that the instrumentation is at the forefront unfortunately many of the songs yorke slurs his clever and great lyrics many of the noises used sound so different than stuff i have heard before you can tell what radiohead did here was special revolutionary how they arranged the album is perfect weakest songs in the middle strong songs at beginning and end the weak ones are let down and electioneering but you barely notice being stunned by exit music and no surprises 12 disjointed events creating one cohesive album about the social paranoia in modern timeswow this album deserves its spot in the top 10 of all time it is pure bliss,4.00,1325
of all the music on this site this album is the greatest of all time yeah fml,4.00,77
kind of annoying obviously i did not get the gist of the record maybe i appreciate it better on a day when i am a little depressed but of course they are extremely wellcrafted songs i do not take credit for any of them and i do not think it is bad when they say that the record was a milestone in the 90s since despite not having liked it it has its merits i understand why many put him on an altar and praise him which in my opinion is not for much but the album deserves it,2.50,475
normally when you give the highest of recommendation or praise you will have some explaining to do the thing is this is radioheads ok computer no explanation needed generally considered to be the album to end all albums i knew that when i got around to listening to this album i would enjoy it i came in with some reservations how could an album possibly be all of the things that people are saying about it not even hearing it i had extremely high expectations up until then i listened to other stuff but this was the top of mt everest and so with the highest of expectations i bought this album i was thirteen and while i loved classic rock i had not really expanded my horizons listening to it it topped the feeling i had listening to dark side of the moon for the first time it was an explosion of sounds relaxing at times futuristic while remaining down to earth i felt like i was in deep space nine listening to subterranean homesick alien soo out of this world but earthy at the same time if that makes sense i did not measure the future albums i listened to against ok computer because it would be unfair in terms of albums there is ok computer and then the rest of  them,5.00,1179
it is alright this is supposedly the best album ever by some people i do not really see why it is really well produced and flows really well but i just do not listen to it that much kind of cold and sterile,4.50,206
having somehow heard kid a before hearing ok computer i still struggle to see why this album is considered their high point not that it is bad but it does not hold the mystery of kid a for me,3.50,191
radiohead have almost always for one reason or another left a bad taste in my mouth i have referred to them as pretentious overrated grating directionless etc and probably much worse yet now i find myself praising an album of theirs as highly as possible in nearly every capacity ok computer is drastically different from the radiohead albums that came after it the song structure is tight and neat it is really the only record of theirs you can even call progressive or experimental as everything since has relied on little or no songwriting craft to then build upon sonically the atmosphere is warmer and more comfortable than the barren digital wasteland of a record like kid a or the psychedelic disorientation of in rainbows and the songs are more accesible one of my biggest gripes against radiohead is thom yorkes singing on their more recent albums he spends too much time trying to create and control tension with the shapeshifting uberfalsetto that has become his trademark this is foolish when you have johnny greenwood in your band his guitar performances on this album are unforgettable he is subtle when yorkes vocals are driving the songs but cranks up the fuzz and gets nasty as the groove breaks down lyrically it is less ambiguous which i like although the music alone is so good that yorke could be singing anything and it would not matter i find him unintelligible most of the time anyway i have have harbored a deep prejudice against this band for a long while but even this cannot prevent me from being profoundly impressed with the music here it is a phenomenal experience which is hard to describe best track electioneering,5.00,1647
i knew this album was never going to live up my expectations with the reputation this thing has you would expect it to reveal the meaning of life give you fail proof advice as to how to make you a billionaire and cure cancer i knew it could never be as good as that so i went in looking for something extraordinary expecting to find something disappointing i did not really end up disappointed and ended up with very nice bits i will take that ok computer is about three quarters a great album there are a number of tracks i find rather impressive this album manages to convey a cold and alien feeling yet somehow is very relateable this is really well exemplified from the get go airbag and paranoid android flow well and have a brooding sound of keyboards and occasional guitar flourish to make it all come together very smooth ok computer is a very dreamy album i am fond of such flowing tracks like subterranean homesick alien for something so popular and loved i am amazed at how subtle the whole affair is if i could only take one to the desert island i would go for no surprises though my issues come from deviations from this sound it is all about the keyboards and they are what carry this mood whenever the guitars or piano come out full force the album becomes exponentially worse usually exit music for a film is horribly boring for example and karma police is a non event other than those instances i do not find much to complain about and electioneering is an exception to that statement it is very energetic and wakes the listener back up i am happy with this purchase while not among my all times favorites ok computer is the kind of album i can see people getting exited about it is influence is apprent in todays alternativeindie crowd and with a few listens it is not hard to see why i am looking forward to trying out more from radiohead,4.00,1857
hmm this album is the bane of my life it is good so why do i hate it so much it is quite distressing to me the music is fine but where is the warmth i find this album nihilistic dull and void of any kind of energy i have tried to listen to it again and again it freezes me out every time,2.00,287
i finally got around to buying this recently my brother has owned it for years so i would heard it often enough but never seemed to be in the mood to buy it when looking for new cds until a few weeks back and i am definitely glad i finally got around to it it was on quite high rotation for the first couple of weeks but that has lessened a fair bit since is it the best album ever no and it is not even in my top ten or possibly my top 20 but it is a really good album fitter happier is the one weak track and it is not that the idea of the song is bad or even necessarily the execution more that it just does not seem to fit the way it is placed in the album there are some fantastic songs on here  my favourites being subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film and electioneering  and lots of very good songs but radiohead are not saviours of the music world a great band and a great album yes and worth owning but that is it  no more no less,4.00,952
i hate to be just another one of many people giving this album a 5 but it deserves it this album flows perfectly well with the exception of subterranean homesick alien which i occasionally skip but songs like exit music climbing up the walls and no surprises make this the best album of the 90s without a shadow of a doubt this album is filled with paranoia fitter happier paranoid android sadness let down no surprises but always seems to have genuine emotion infused into the music and lyrics which definitely is not easy to accomplish especially as radiohead did it it here,4.50,576
judging by the many reviews about the record and by sales ok computer broke many records this album became a sort of borderline for the band  a smooth transition from guitar to electronic sound with all the predominance of the first option no surprises is by far one of radioheads most successful singles and paranoid android is considered their finest work well you cannot help but agree,5.00,388
contrary to popular opinion this does get quite old when you have heard it too much it already sounds worse 15y after,4.00,117
according to this site it is one of the best albums of all time but there are some weak tracks fitter happier is the lamest song ever made subterranean homesick alien is nothing special the tourist is one of their best soft songs but nowhere near as good as their hards karma police is their best soft song and just outside of my top 100 electioneering is the best song on the album in my opinion and paranoid android is not that far behind no surprises is a great song as well not their best album but not their worst either 8 album of all time is absolutely ridiculous though come on guys get some musical taste,3.50,613
this album offended my sensibilities even though i listen more regularly i love endless style my hairs stand on end on my arms a little gem,4.00,139
there are twenty years to go and twenty ways to know who will wear who will wear the hat there are twenty years to go and many friends i know enjoy the ride some may hold the rose some hold the rope that is the end and that is the start of it that is the whole and that is the part of it thats the high and that is the heart of it that is the long and that is the short of it that is the best and that is the test in it that is the doubt the doubt the trust in it that is the sight and that is the sound of it that is the gift and that is the trick in it concentrate on more than meets the eye for you are the truth not i,5.00,621
as great as the bends was ok computer is where radiohead really became radiohead this is a band that constantly reinvents itself and to depart so drastically from proven success this early in a bands life is rare oh and this album is actually great in its own right,4.50,265
bleak haunting and beautiful,5.00,28
well are not this an amazing album freaking love it from beginning to end the direction they took with this album after their previous two which i completely love as well was one for the better clearly leading the bands musical minds into writing the classic records that followed this one it was the branch from more of a brit popalternative rock band to more of a progressive electronic band this album began the journey of amazing sounds and mind sapping ingenuity that makes radiohead such an amazing contemporary band a true landmark in terms of the bands musical direction and freedom to break free of the chains of the conventional sounds that were occurring at the time in truth i have not really thought of this album as being any near better or more creative than there other albums which have all been amazing with great consistency much to the likes of that of the beatles collection of records still it is classic radiohead and therefore mindbogglingly good,5.00,970
the best album from the 90s until now the one who made the rock revolution of the last years,5.00,92
horrifying lyrics endlessly listenable music a sonic surprise even on the 1000th listen,5.00,87
clean up time 250809 this is basically what millions of people have defined as the greatest album ever recorded no such thing at least not on my book nevertheless i still love it ok computer is the experimental turn radiohead took in their career and flatout reinvented their whole way of writing and performing music it stands for many important things for everyone listening to this bands music on a personal note this album along with few others saved my life around 2008 especially the last 4 songs which for me are one of the most beautiful moments in the whole history of music the tourist is one of those brilliant album closers that just sums up every single emotion and sensation explored all the way through the album kind of like all apologies by nirvana or inside job by pearl jam the atmospherics all over these 12 songs are flawless and there is this strange element of unrest beauty and intangible feelings that come to me every time i listen to ok computer that is what makes it special for me i cannot really say this is the bands magnum opus however this is easily the record they will be best remembered by in 20 years,5.00,1137
one of the most diverses haunting and surprising pieces of music i have ever heard,5.00,82
yay my favourite album of all time by my favourite band of all time is the new number 1 album on rateyourmusic this album is just fantastic,5.00,139
i hate clicking i used to own this on anythingbecause it is like what the eff happened to it if you used to own it whathahell welli sat on it then spilled peru balsam on it before my dog chewed it,0.50,196
what can i say about this that has not already been said nothing probably here though they take the sound of the bends and digitalised it into something truly staggering but their songwriting is if anything even more impressive songs like paranoid android show their ambition but its simpler songs in writing if not production like let down and karma police that really impress and the best bit it was recorded around the corner from where i live,5.00,446
epic in scope perfect in execution the most important album of the 90s,5.00,70
let it first be said neither as good nor as important a record as the bends and the same can be said with the follow up kid a in mind in other words by far the most overrated radiohead album when that is said and out of the way let it then be said that there is no way ok computer could get less than 45 stars which says more about the band that produced this rather than the album itself they have a hard time doing anything wrong,4.50,431
was in one or another big award named the best album of the last millennium  and there should be no doubt that i think it is really good i especially love the song no surprises,4.50,176
except for electioneering and the tourist that i really have to skip each time i love it  it is emotional it is melancholic the lyrics are witty the music is deep beautiful sad the voice is depressive and bewitching i cannot put into words all the emotions felt when listening to this album you are in another world when you listen to them at least i am,5.00,353
huge disk the real catapult to world fame for radiohead considered one of the most relevant albums in the 90s thanks to songs like karma police no surprises or airbag a masterpiece from which luckily you can still listen to live performances it has been completely covered by the group easy all stars giving their particular vision of this great ok computer essential,5.00,367
i just have to add my voice to the group that says huh i do not love it i do not hate it is it good yes is it the most incredibly wonderful album to appear in the past few decades i do not think so this is not a case of i have not listened to it enough or i have not been listening to it long enough i have been listening to this fairly regularly since it came out over ten years ago i even perk up my ears for paranoid android thinking that might give me a glimpse of what all the fuss and bother is about it just does not grab me yes it is good wellcrafted earcandy no it is not superbly excellent,3.50,599
changed my musical way of thinking just completely blew me away,5.00,63
one of the few albums worth 5 stars even the weaker tracks subterranean homesick alien electioneering are brilliant most people will gripe at fitter happier but it is only 2 minutes long and is a decent enough bridge between karma police and electioneering,5.00,256
i loved this when it first came out in fact it was probably in my alltime top five albums for quite a while it just has not aged well for me the tracks that i thought were just pretty good no alams no surpirses electioneering subterrainian homesick alien when it came out are now annoying to me yeah there are timeless cuts on this exit music lucky climbing up the walls but i cannot seem to listen to this all the way through anymore thus it is by no means a perfect or even great album still worth having in a collection but by no means essential,4.00,548
this is one of the few records i can put on and listen to from start to finish without skipping a track every song just flows together perfectly personal favorite moments jonnys guitar work on the tourist and paranoid android the outro to karma police colins bassline on airbag,5.00,277
it is a great album one of the best i have heard in recent times and i think it can be classified as one of the best albums of the 90s the musical continuity the fluidity and the concept that it intends to convey are noted likewise it makes clear the style of this english group that likes to experiment with their music to evolve in other words i could say that this is a round enough disk with an ad hoc start and end a slightly accelerated beginning a smooth and gradual end,5.00,477
strangely i am not that much into radioheads other albums both older or more recent but i love this one the whole atmosphere is very well put some songs have a really catchy and easy tone but are not cheap pop ballads,5.00,217
cannot believe it took me this long totally lives up to all the hype,5.00,68
ok computer 1997 i essentially hear three things when i listen to this album the bends the beatles and something that is just starting to emerge as the experimental radiohead experimental is in quotations because this is pop music and experimentation involves usually only bringing back old tricks and styles of music from older generations and introducing them to a new generation but first why does this sound like the bends still honestly i do not see the jump that much just a different guitar tone it is not such a bad thing either i mean apart from a few of the songs relying more on atmosphere and studioproduced noises than the atmosphere of an acoustic rhythm guitar the others are all written in the same style but these songs are on the whole better the message is clear that this album is about the decay of the individual in a society becoming more and more distant and coldly electronic i do not feel the paranoia though and i remain completely unaffected by the message what is special about the album though is that the message is really an afterthought and the music stands alone as a great accomplishment this is what mainstream pop should sound like and it was light years behind the independent artists until this album brought it all back to now after ok computer electronic pop artists started shooting up everywhere in a world where the acoustic alternative poppy ballad or pearl jam song formerly was king even people who never heard this album were affected in the years to come by its wide impact but like i said i do not feel the paranoia it is too pretty it is not experimental in the slightest this is what pop music needed the fact that this is what mainstream music needed is what brings me to my next point the beatles when the beatles refocused pop music by basing their pop in rock n roll they were huge because they were marketable and lennon was one of a few willing to really sing his face off on twist and shout what we wanted in the 90s was a refocused mainstream scene we did not want pearl jam anymore by 97 and nirvana was still ruling the day the after effects of these bands were disastrous and came in the form of the offspring and blink182 ok computer made it ok to be a little softer instead of bringing rock n roll to the front the way the beatles did and they had a ton of help radiohead brought the nursery rhyme ballad and the electronic sound to the mainstream so what is the difference between the two and why did this album eventually negatively affected the scene when the beatles refocused pop music they had contemporaries that were very capable the who the rolling stones the animals the beach boys and bob dylan are just a few radiohead really has and never had a contemporary to keep them in check so while we are not as music crazy as the world seemed to be in 65 we still love our pop music and radiohead took the throne no longer as king of pop acts but as supreme ruler this became the bible it simply is not that good though it is very good the point is sgt peppers was a great album and everyone copied it but after that was over they moved on the stones made exile on main st dylan had 3 great albums at the same time the who did a whole assortment of things that were completely removed from sgt peppers ok computer still rules the world in pop music we have not had anyone challenge it in any way this is the reason that i do not like radiohead or part of it anyway they monotonized pop music for 10 years i know that is not a word but still i mean come on indie music is now nothing more than a radiohead lookalike contest of course we are moving away from this album now but damn are we late 10 years the third thing is the least important so i have saved it for last radiohead is becoming modern radiohead on this album their more experimental side is just a new guitar tone and a slightly modified way of organizing a song to rely more heavily on studio production and percussion i do not love it i do not hate it i do not buy the message but i do not have to either there are no actual emotions on this record and there is no paranoia however taken by itself its still a damn fine record 810,4.00,4165
1997 was an interesting year for music in the sense that the stranglehold of britpop heavyweights blur oasis and pulp ended their places would be taken by radiohead and the verve as these two seasoned bands would finally achieve mainstream success radiohead had gained a cult following both in fan circles and in the music press with their sensational album the bends their only problem now was how to at least equal it from the minute i heard ok computer my overwhelming emotion was one of slight disappointment and when hearing everyone praising it to the hilt this just added to my frustrations obviously recreating the bends was not an option for a band so prone to experimentation but the cold emptiness on parts of this album were for me unsatisfying airbag is a similar opener to planet telex as the scene is set in a seemingly futuristic setting or the next world war to be precise complete with crashing drums and heavy singlenote riffing yorke describes surviving a near fatal car crash and what an interesting opener air bag is the only slight downside being the studio trickery that consists of numerous stops and starts which affects the songs momentum my first experience of paranoid android was when returning home after the end of my fifth year exams when seeing the video on mtv i remember being utterly baffled by what i sawheard and to some extent i still am to this day yes it is rambling yes it is pretensious and yes the lyrics are all over the place despite this there are redeeming qualities in the general atmosphere and cohesiveness of it all for much of this album i could simply state not as good as anything on the bends it would be easy however with subterranean homesick alien i find myself thinking just that a generally sleepy ballad it lacks the emotional depth of anything on the last album and the somewhat geeky subject of extraterrestrials is not every ones cup of cocoa jonny greenwoods chiming guitar does to some extent enhance an otherwise ordinary track exit music for a film despite being a commendable enough effort does sound a bit over dramatic the theme of escape is set against theatrical style music and is a bit cringeworthy unfortunately the appropriately titled let down is indeed a let down as yorke tries to convey a snippet of modern day living sadly it lacks any of the all consuming power of a just or iron lung on what is the poorest track thus far it features mumbled vocals and a melody very similar to no surprises try fitting in it is lyrics and you will see what i mean after some disappointing moments it is good to hear a nice simplistic track like karma police greenwood ditching his guitar in favour of the electric piano is a gamble which pays off as yorke has great fun with his threatening words unfortunately fitter happier is next and the less said about this the better after the chaotic electioneering we reach the massive attack styled climbing up the walls which is an obvious highlight dark and sinister it features lyrics that should probably merit an asbo the two most outstanding moments on ok computer come in the shape of no surprises and lucky the former uses high pitched xylophone notes which work in tandem with ed obriens guitar and this creates a sound simiar to the velvet undergrounds sunday morning no surprises comes across as a very sad song with an air of resignation to the future that lies in store despite the revolutionarytype line bring down the government in lucky yorkes theme is of one of positivity despite the mournful sound of the track pull me out of the aircrash pull me out of the lake he sings lucky was actually released on the complation album help which was a charity album for the war in the former yugoslavia so perhaps this was a surprise inclusion sadly ok computer does not end particularly well due to the lacklustre the tourist obvioulsy another finishing track such as street spirit was unlikely but did they have to provide us with such a lame effort as this one can only imagine what the misfit teenagers who spent their lives finding solace in the angstridden creep must have thought at hearing such a flimsy track as this ok computer whlle being excellent in places must go down as a disappointing follow up to the bends as a first album it would have been an excellent way for a new band to introduce themselves but it is the too many lifeless moments on here that are a bit of a let down i for one am continually perplexed at the high praise this album gains,4.00,4485
when i first heard this album i was captivated and drawn into a new passion for the here and now,5.00,96
i cannot find why it is amazing maybe more listens well tell me why the majority of this site has rated it 5 stars but for now it gets 4 it is pretty great music one of the better cds i have heard in the past few months i admit karma police is the definite stand out of this album it is a great follow up track from the song let down pretty much is this the only album on this website that has 10000 ratings radiohead has to be the most popular band on the planet edit nevermind i understand why this album is so well liked now it is too hard to explain this album is just plain amazing,5.00,586
i cannot find the weakness of this record,5.00,41
this is ok computer with pi for emphasis criminally underrated especially compared to their cult hit amnesiac yeah ok songs like pulkpull revolving doors and hunting bears get all the attention and radio airplay and two of my personal favorites paranoid android and karma police are always ignored by the mainstream but i do believe that there is a possibility that i might be able to consider fathoming the thought that these songs might just be better actually i am undecided to which i prefer it is like choosing which of my tits is my favorite i love all three of them airbag starts off with a death metal drum beat and quickly descends into beautiful indie space melodies near the end of the song radiohead starts to do their interpretation of hiphop complete with turntables no actually those are guitars but you would never be able to tell unless you read wut i just wrote  paranoid android is the effectsladen six minute epic of the album it goes through multiple and equally eargasmic parts until finally the band reeks all havoc and greenwood lays down the final guitar solo it is so cool it sounds like the guitar is going through a computer and getting assraped by viruses or something then we have the intergalactic trip subterranean homesick alien with beautiful spacey sound effects n stuff when you get to exit music for a film you will start to cry    why you cryin becuzyou already heard the 3 best songs on the album yes unfortunately after subterranean homesick alien nothing else on the album comes close but that is not to say the rest are bad in fact they are great it is just none of them are as good fitter happier the people who dislike fitter happier just are not in in what rainbows vaginas no they certainly are not in beneath the cold robotic voice which is used to give the feeling of someone who has to do everything completely scheduled in a way that is almosti do not know cold and robotic is a cryptic piano riff and lots of squeaky little noises that will delight the ears of some if they are able to find it it is hidden quite well it is a secret fitter happier is definitely the most inaccessible free improvisational avantgarde noise tracks that i have ever heard even more so than such 20th century jazz avangardists as john coltrane and john zorn climbing up the walls is another goodie with its boggy swampy dissonance exit music for a film is very empty sounding up until the spinetingling bassline comes in no surprises is also nice and relaxing electioneering even though sounding like something that could have been on the vastly unsuperior album the bends is actually good for what it is and what it is is simple bouncy britpop but check that gr1m black metaleque tremolo riffing around the middle of the song tr00 i could care less if let down was left off the album and i do care less much much fucking less ok computer is an aweinspiring journey through space rock that keeps a very modern technological feel through out 5 starz 1 there i just wrote a review in all caps lock waitwhat the fuck dammit that was lowercase fuck i wish there was some way to highlight it all and turn it into uppercase damnoh well i guess small letters can be pretty avantgarde too,5.00,3210
eleven years ago i was nine i remember my father would drive down from pennsylvania to long island to pick me up to spend time with him this would happen 34 times a year and on the six hour drive back up to pennsylvania he would play pablo honey maybe like three or four tracks off of it the bends and ok computer constantly being a nine year old i clearly did not understand the brilliance that was radiohead but there was always something in thom yorkes voice that would dig inside your chest tapping into your emotions even if you were a nine year old boy i did not know the name of the band i did not know who they were i just knew the music and his voice everything was always so distinct and original i remember hearing yorkes voice during let down for the first time it made me miss my dad because i never got to see him and it made me miss my mom because i was leaving her to go away for a while i started to tear but refused to cry yorkes voice was cutting straight through me forcing me to actually show emotion this was my first actual musical discovery eleven years later i shower this album with so much praise there is not a single second of it that i would change this album is one of the most beautiful things released in the past 20 years maybe even more and definitely the best album of the 90s this album has always worked as a whole for me from the start of airbag to the end of the tourist it sucks you in with every single subtle sound it is been eleven years and i still find myself spotting new things happening that i never noticed before it is one of those albums where words can really do no justice but this is radioheads masterpiece there magnum opus astonishing life changing beautiful and challenging everything a record should be favorite tracks paranoid android let down karma police no surprises lucky,5.00,1835
amazing all of the songs are moving and brilliant,4.50,49
an almost perfect work of art the best album of all time i allow myself to say yes,5.00,82
out of all the thousands of albums and tens of thousands of songs i have heard from a greeaaat hhhheeeeeiiiiight is the first thing that comes to mind when my mind is looking for a tune and nothings playing thanks thom yorke,4.00,224
so this is that album that everyone says is the best of the 90s and so on if such a thing is possiblenaming a record the best of a certain period this is defenitly not the best album of the 90s karma police  let down no surprises and electioneering are great songs undeniable but the rest bores me one of the things that annoys me the most with radiohead is the fact that some songs could have been much more interesting ones most of the songs especially airbag paranoid android and the tourist are good ones but they are too long and turn into somehing boring i have never been a fan of radiohead i have to confess i really wanted to listen their records in order to rate them properly listened more than 5 times but they really fail to amuse me this is not a bad record no way i just think that it has nothing that makes it that really great record if you also think that comparing ok computer with the de facto great records of the 90s mezzanine or blue lines massive attack rid of me and to bring you my love pj harvey homogenic bjrk dummy portishead to name a few is an heresy you better keep that thought with you unless you are ready to hearread things like you are retarded stupid and you do not like good music and do not really know what good music is remember that is what you get when you mess with them,3.00,1315
one of the best albums i own i put this on a par with kid a as radioheads best work favourite tracks exit music let down the tourist,5.00,132
overrated simply put there is no reason lyrically or musically that this should be on any top list for the 90s it is a decent album of the 90s but there are far greater albums i am very happy this got kicked to the curb by manic street preachers the holy bible in the newsnight quintessential poll the bends is a far greater album it is a masterpiece this is just condensed and bloated with plenty of hype sort of like oasis be here now but before the release some high points are exit music karma police airbag and no surprises but that is about it and it is inconsistent people who do not really know music turn to this album and add to the cliche that it is great this cliche is false it is fairly good and that is that,3.50,722
radiohead started with the massive success of their song creep and later with the album the bends but they reached brilliance with their masterpiece album ok computer they had a hit with the amazing progrock single paranoid android and after that karma police and no surprises this is perhaps the definitive album of the 90s and certainly the best album of 1997 ok computer is a bit of an emotional roller coaster of different styles and sounds that all come together to make something truly memorable after this album the band would take an entirely new direction but this will always remain their great popprogart rock milestone as future generations discover radiohead they will no doubt be in awe of what the band did here 5 stars my favourite songs are paranoid android let down no surprises and airbag,5.00,807
guess what i like this album its very very good but number 8th of all time o god no perhaps the top 100 at a push the top 50 but not 8th but no matter how low i scored this it wudnt make a difference so i might aswell be honest it has absolutely make yu shiver songs on it but i will not talk about them cus everyone knows them i am going to talk about what i think the flaws are no 1 let down what a pointless song it just seems like its being depressing for the sake of depressing moan moan everyone is dissapointed no2 is there any need whatsoever for fitter happier the answer is no no3 where you think they might do a bit of a grand finale to finish it all off nicely they have the pairing of lucky and the tourist which are both amiable songs in their own right but they both seem like the slowest songs in the world and for me this makes the album seem like it kind of peters out with no real closure that said all these things stacked up only knock half a star off for me which i think shows the quality of the majority of the material here and as a whole it probably deserves legendary status but eighth best of all time when it has quite glaring flaws hmm,4.50,1165
the peak for both radiohead and indie rock recorded in a victorian mansion formerly property of actress jane seymour using the natural echoes of the different rooms working with electronic textures adding complex rhythmicpatterns and everchanging song structures evolving lyrically from teenage rage to adulthood resignation and expanding notably their music palette radiohead created an astonishing masterpiece that deals with modern world alienation with an impressive deepness,5.00,479
i used to listen this album everyday during 199798 i learned to play guitar because of it and i think radiohead brought back the ideal running time of an album with ok computer so even if i do not listen much to this kind of music now i know it is one of the greatest album from my generationand that in a way it changed my life,5.00,328
this is radioheads turning point their 1st 2 albums were good especially the bends but showed little of what radiohead has since become namely in my opinion the best band to date ok comp puts them in a league with the beatles pink floyd  led zeppelin it shows the diversity of styles from the high energy rock of electioneering to the sweet  beautiful exit music i would recommend this as a 1st radiohead album if you do not have any yet their next 2 albums kid a  amnesiac are ultimately better but much less accessible,4.50,520
the music of the 90s is not understood without this album i am not a big fan of radiohead but with this album they made history fantastic what is wrong with my disk i really do not know it is hard to come close to perfection,4.00,224
i do not dislike it it is a really good album however it has a hard time competing with in rainbows kid a and especially the bends,3.50,130
album45 10 years on this album still sounds like it was produced in the future an album in a class of its own really is one of the greatest albums ever made easily,5.00,163
shoot me for it but i really do not like this album it is not because i hate radiohead i really like the bends or because i hate everything that is not accessible i love troutmask replica stupid dream my life in the bush of ghosts and just about everything king crimson ever did it is just because i think these songs just are not that good let us start with something positive and discuss the things on here that i like airbag is a nice opener the drum sound may be awful but the guitar riff is good and the whole song reminds me a bit of king crimsons red that is a good thing karma police is really a great song as much as i hate thom yorkes voice i must admit the song is great and when sung by somebody else joe jackson performed it live in 1999 i actually enjoy it subterranean homesick blues is also a fine song but give me anything from the bends over that anyday then we have paranoid android it starts off as a good song but it goes wrong once we get to the ambition makes you look pretty ugly part from that bit onwards its an awful combination of thom yorke screaming loud guitars an awful guitar solo from somebody who obviously has not had a lot of guitar lessons is it jonny greenwood or ed obrien who cares a slow closing section going back to a loud climax again at the end with no structure anywhere to be found did i mention those lyrics offwithhisheadmantheyuppiesnetworkingthevomitwhydontyouremembermynamefromagreatheightgodloveshischildren sorry this stuff is not just my cup of tea both exit music for a film and let down sound like travis at their worst lifeless uninspired britpop abba sounds like hardcore punk compared to this then there is also 2 minutes of nonsense spoken by a computer program another attempt at heavy metal or whatever one small bit of glockenspiel music that turns out to be an entire song and we get to hear thom yorke repeating hey man slow down slow down over and over again as far as choruses go that is not really mr tambourine man hey jude california girls satisfaction or sunny afternoon is it the only thing good about that is that you know the albums over in a few minutes i do not care what other people think about this album to me it is a deeply disappointing follow up to the excellent the bends the band is obviously not playing it safe but to me this mix of nonsense lyrics unstructured songs and electronic effects just does not sound right there are a handful of highlights which i have mentioned before but it is all not enough to make the album anything more than average,2.50,2539
i love this album i was only 6 or 7 when this came out and had yet to really experience my first computer i remember when my family had its first red macintosh  i used to play some archaic hunting game on the damned machine for hours the first step in appreciating a computer for its entertainment value over the years computers have come to define many of our human relationships my family moved to texas because my dad found a job on a computer my friend makes his living playing videogames on a pc some of my wildest imaginings were prompted by the deep portals of the internet and through this instrument all of us have been liberated into bloggers artists hackers etc here we can make our own profession this review is only available on a computer there is no paper archive no physical treasury this does not scare me the mass amounts of information available at our fingertips is necessarily doubleedged  a reminder that there is more to discover as well as a warning to turn off the laptop once in a while my experience on message boards in particular has taught me valuable lessons about the intermediary role of communication its positive and negative effects essentialy whether i have used the phrase okay computer or not my young adult life has been particularly marked by many different occasions in which i have had to retain some perspective as to the role and function of computers in my life passions inflamed by people you have never met it is okay unsure about how secure your data is it is okay lost a a whole cache of irreplaceable photos because of an accidental press of the delete key it is okay  it is just a computer i have poured many of my thoughts much of my time and energy into computers i have learned about them although i do not understand them i have enjoyed them and resented them but mostly i have just come to view them as anything else in life  a part of the environment to me this album is hopeful and inspiring much has been made of the dissociative and depressing quality of yorkes lyrics one day i am going to grow wingsa chemical reactionhysterical and useless you are you are perhaps perfectly reflects what i find to be the sort of equanimity of yorkes depressing lyrics our emotions such as they are are as magnificent as a soaring eagle and as simple and reductive as a chemical reaction we experience them as flying but the reasons are quite simple quite mundane i quite like this sort of realization  that the moments that make life most worth living has some sort of basis in my basic function as a human being even the most amazing moments of life are part of the normal mundane cycles we all tread i am sorry to talk away from actual music here but this album is about human experience i am writing from a train losing myself in writing a review listening to this album which at one point meant the world to me for four years i left the album and radiohead though i have never resented them coming back to the album i find that i draw much intellectual enjoyment from analyzing it is content whereas before i really just liked the way it sounds and what would trains buses the metro be like without music imagine all these rote exercises without headphones without the context of the music we listened to that morning to make it all okay  to slow down that quickening pace of life to a few bars to live in a few measure of music that is maybe why fitter happier is so haunting  it does not mention music it is sad it is just human actions without intonation or melody it is a vision of apocalypse surrounded by the rest those musical interpretations that show even the saddest beings find some sort of redemption in sound,4.50,3673
pretty hard to find something bad about this albumjust listen to it it is pure magic,4.00,84
almost perfect sometimes its hard to make out what thom is saying,4.50,65
in my top 10 albums of all time radiohead peaked with this album and have since been unable to reach this level of greatness although kid a was damn close,5.00,154
one of the greatest rock albums ever the power of electioneering the melody of karma police the disturb of climbing up the walls or the coldness of fitter happier thousands of faces masterwork,5.00,192
i did not like it very much at first thom yorkes vocals grated at my nerves and fitter happier was unforgivable after i would heard the bends and grown quickly to enjoy it i returned to ok computer and began the long process of feeding myself spoonful after spoonful naturally the taste improved with time but it was not until i began to reassess yorkes voice that the album really began to click the emotion is extremely raw and the concept certainly allows for the oddity of a track mentioned above to find a logical niche i love ok computer,4.50,543
a more thorough and detailed reasoning as to why this album garnered the perfect score is on its way but for right now all i have to say is believe the hype,5.00,156
i know your supposed to love this record but it never did anything for me some of the songs are catchy enough like subterranean homesick alien and let down but it is mostly fairly boring you do not have to completely give up on guitars lads seriously,3.50,250
this album is absolutely incredible i completely agree with jazzyjonas in saying that the reason that radiohead is so amazing is that they released this music ahead of their time the pure genius and the songwriting of thom yorke is incomprehensible he is an amazing talent even his solo album was absolutely incredible,5.00,318
you have got pages full of what i think about this album great one of the albums that gives musical landmarks to my generation,5.00,126
one of the key albums in history nearly 20 years later his lyrics about alienation and todays society keep getting stronger and stronger,5.00,136
i love everything on this album these guys are brilliant claimed as one of the best albums ever but eh i digress still amazing,4.50,126
a very overrated album ok computer is the best album of the 90s are you kidding  there is only one brilliant song on this album and that is karma police the rest are very average pieces also exit music and no suprises deserve a mention i was expecting the album to knock my socks off and i only got a medium album ten pearl jamu or blood sugar sex magik by red hot chili peppers deserve to be called the best album of the 90s normally i would give a rating of 25 but for the fact that there is a track like karma police on the album i am increasing the rating to 3 stars,0.50,570
perfect desolate and uplifting at the same time wow i listen to one song this must play through it is entirety this is an all time classic i to this all the time,5.00,161
a very disappointing album after the sumptuous the bends which announces changes of musical orientations this is also the good side of this group experimentation the problem is that by wanting to evolve too much it happens that we lose fans from the start along the way apart from the excellent karma police i am not at all hooked on this album which wanted to be too big and which is not up to par like the horrifying and intellectualizing pananoid android,3.00,457
its a great album and among the best from the 90s but not the best at the top of my head i can think of flaming lips soft bulletin pavements crooked rain crooked rain bjorks homogenic neutral milk hotels in the aeroplane over the sea my bloody valentines loveless magnetic fields 69 love songs and maybe even pulps different class as better albums from the 90s maybe its because i listened to this album to late after it came out and so many bands nowadays have tried to imitate this sound that it does not seem new to me at all maybe it did back in 97 a lot of the songs are expertly written and played by the band but it sounds too much to me like brit pop meets electronic some times plus i have already heard amnesiac and hail to thief before listening to this so my view of radiohead was not based on creep and the bends still highly recomened,4.00,848
although it is critically acclaimed this album will never receive the credit it deserves not to diss the beatles but any idiot can find something enjoyable about their music the fact that it requires a semiintelligent person to appreciate some of radioheads material is what leads to the idiotic hatred of it it is analogous to people denying evolution simply because they are too lazy to understand it the polarization this album causes should be even more evidence of its substance finally something to contrast dumbasses with openminded people in an artform,5.00,560
this is good music for some specific state of mind which is usually out of my reach,3.50,83
the idea of ok computer on vinyl seems wrong to me who wants warmness on that album i love hospital corridors and airport terminals and vomit splattered stairs ascending to hospital airports this album has created one of my biggest musical regrets back in 1997 ad i was making fun of my girlfriendmanagerbarristaburrow for wanting this album even though i did appreciate the bends i am an idiot such an idiot such an idiot that the next time i will use the wrong article to show my idiocy such a idiot,5.00,501
one of the highest rated albums on all of rym the band that paved the way for the current wave of british progressive rock bands which some of my alltime favourite bands like amplifier and oceansize are part of logically i should love this but to me it is just decent the sound is very good it is hard to think of anything that sounds similar to it which gives the album an unique feel unfortunately the songs are not all very good many of them such as subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film lucky and the tourist fail to keep my interest all the way through i can stand listening to them though there are not any songs i flatout dislike and thankfully there are some songs that stand out from the bunch mainly paranoid android with its great guitars and let down and no surprises has very good vocals and melodies airbag and karma police are a bit better than average as well,3.00,887
paranoid android is a great song andi love karma police dont know why exactly but i think this album is too much overrated,4.00,122
two weeks after i bought ok computer in 2000 i flew off to study abroad in france for 6 weeks i had some other americans to hang out with but living with a host family and interacting with plenty of people whose language i could barely speak left me somewhat isolated maybe that is the reason why i listened to ok computer so often the albums themes of isolation and detachment really spoke to me at the time for a great deal of music nerds ok computer was the big album of our generation besides paranoid androids multiplesongsinone i have never heard too much experimentation in these songs but all of them are interesting to listen to and emotionally affecting let down is just plain gorgeous and climbing up the walls is wonderfully creepy greenwood continued to be radioheads secret weapon and thom yorke wrote the hell out of 11 great songs there is also fitter happier which is a weak spot of sheer pretension but it is easy to overlook it is definitely a cliche to love this album but i do anyway 55,5.00,1007
awesome mindblowing a perfect piece of 21st century rock which stands among the best albums of the genre,5.00,104
solid album but fairly consistent radiohead got better after this album,4.00,71
oh god i just gave ok computer a 5 i am officially part of the problem whatever it is a great album certainly not the greatest in history but well deserving of its high average rating,5.00,183
it amazes me that i have not listen to this album still 2006 when i first popped this into my cd player and airbag came on it was good not great but good but then paranoid android came on and that changed everything about this album the lyrics the singing the guitar work the album shot up to my top 100 albums right there on this track but after subterranean homework alien it shot up to the top 90s exit musicfor a film it shot up to the top 80s let down it shot up to the top 60s the karma police with the help of fitter happier shot it to the top 25 but then something happen electioneering came along with a more rockier sound it did not fit it does not work on this album the guitar is not catchy the voice work is average at best and the weakest song of this album climbing up the walls has the same appeal of electioneering it does not fit on this album that well but it works better then electioneering then this one track no surprises turns around from the last two tracks and become one of the most beloved songs and greatest song of the album and all time even thought not people think of it so because of this one and only song ok computer jumps to the top 5 and will stay there till the end of time the last two tracks are just icing on the cake lucky and the tourist but any of the last three songs could the closer of the album and it would not change a thing about the album at all this one of the most beautiful albums ever made and one of the greatest ever make if this could be ranked like this it would be ranked infinity10 of the greatness of what it has,5.00,1576
radioheads guitardriven masterpiece not as good as kid a but a close second,5.00,75
best album that ever existed it is the center of everything it is because me hurt it is caused me happiness it is caused me confusion it is given me a reason to rejoice it is me in 12 songs,5.00,189
this album moves me enough to review it this is my first after several years here review and may be my last i heard reports in fall 1997 of critics i do not know which ones calling this the best album of all time that was rubbish then as it is now but i had not heard it to that point except karma police so i went into it with expectations and skepticism which vanished quickly i really dug it through college but did not listen to it for probably 200506 ten years is my personal yardstick for a great albums efficacy i did not have any emotion for inevermindi by 2001 and expected about the same for this but it sounds fresh now and as prescient and emotionally ranging as others have suggested this is not my favorite album but it is really special as commercial music goes i try not to be hyperbolic but if you marked this with less than 3 stars i do not think you like good music now,5.00,888
without the maybe the most overrated album in the history of pop music there are only three decent songs the inventiveness the innovation are conspicuous by their absence and the production is pathetic how can you respect this nigel and the singing voice well maybe nobody remembers neil young i understand that after this album they took a turn they did not get what they wanted and they keep trying for that alone they deserve my respect oh and the three of the score is because it brings back good memories,3.00,509
this album is just fantastic two albums that are quintessential to the 90s nevermind for the beginning of the decade and ok computer for near the end of it this album is hard to explain but its impact and just its goodness cannot be ignored listen to it yourself and see that it just fit for the time it came out in the world is a better place because of this album i know it saved lives its honesty and overall sound was never before and will never be again one of a kind masterpiece,5.00,484
this is an album of excellent songs well of course some are more excellent than others but there are not really any bad songs one filler though radiohead display a fine variety here the first track airbag is a relatively standard rock tune that has been given the distinctive and slightly unnerving thom yorke vibe in contrast with this we are presented with the schizophrenic paraniod android a truly stunning musical journey the album follows the tone set by the first two songs occasionally scratching at the excellence of paranoid android but inevitably not exceeding it this album is simply a must for any rock collection,4.50,626
besides the superb songwriting well the whole mystery that surrounds ok computer is interesting as well is it a conceptual record did the protagonist not survive the car crash after all as we may or may not experience from listening to the tourist is he drumroll a ghostyes climbing up the walls is the best thing ever written in case you were wondering key track climbing up the walls 483,5.00,389
one of the truely grand musical experiences one would ever dream to take a final masterwork in every way in every form if you do not believe me just listen to karma police and well that is all friends go out and grab it babe,5.00,224
one of my favourite albums innovative and catchy always moving,4.50,62
best radiohead album to date it took me a few years and then suddenly it hit me i got it paranoid android  classic song makes me want to bang my head against a wall karma police  i used to like it but no more climbing up the walls  on of the scariest songs in the world best radiohead song ever electioneering  nice songseems as if it belongs in the bends musically exit music  one of the best songs ever,5.00,404
this album is my bible this is the first radiohead album i ever heard and consequently why they are my favorite band it just captures what they are trying to get across so clearly there is a very clear feel to this album and you feel compassion and caring for the characters within eventually you feel just as claustrophobic as they do i rarely ever listen to this album without starting at the beginning and listening without interruption to the end i would give a songbysong synopsis but i feel that would spoil the album it takes a good 56 listens to appriciate fully but trust me its worth it and it always will be a year now and i honestly can say that i will never get tired of it ever sometimes i like to take breaks every once and a while just so that when i come back its twice as sweet as before and i still get the exact same feeling i get listening to airbag as the first time i heard it inside borders at the listening station and each time i listen to this album it grows more profound,5.00,999
what can i say about this to me ok computer is one of those acclaimed albums that truly deserve the hype i can hear a lot of effort in each song everything feels complete and accomplished and it looks like it has not aged anything through these years although there are a few tracks i do not really like at the start airbag subterranean homesick alien and exit music that has become somehow disturbingly melodramatic the others stayed with me and still mean something lucky is my favourite one climbing up the walls and let down are close behind and i would not say i got bored of songs like paranoid android no surprises or karma police for now either maybe because of the memories but these songs feel very layered both in production and meaning i think you can still find something new after several listens and while all of them are quite varied the album has a very special consistent atmosphere and in general it is very relatable and moving maybe that is the reason why people love this album so much or it is simply because this is a collection of damn good songs,4.50,1071
when i first heard creep i said there is something about this band that i cannot place my finger on it but they sound great  i went out and bought pablo honey and thought this is not that great an album but they are not a onehit wonder either there is some great material here they came out with the release of my iron lung and i said oh my god rock has been saved needless to say i was right and ok computer is the pinnacle of the bands career so far,5.00,451
this album is soso kid a and amnesiac are much better in my opinion the fact that people consider it one of the best records ever is bizarre i just do not get it,2.00,161
how do you go about giving a detailed insight into such a critically acclaimed album from possibly the most talked about band ever you do not just shut up and get it do not talk about how amazing you think it is we know already we know,5.00,235
this is one of those albums that i can actually sit through and listen to every track and not skip any it is the album that got me into radiohead but certainly not my favorite of theirs,5.00,185
definatly in my top 5 the first radiohead album i really listened to and karma police was the song that made me love radiohead to begin with,5.00,140
one of the greatest band of 90 and that is their best album just a masterpiece every song is special,5.00,100
if the album just stopped after fitter happier it would get a 5,4.00,63
strange and vague of course that is the essence of the album but the lyrics do not make sense sure the album has it is shining moments  karma police climb up the walls exit music but it can be strange and depressing paranoid android is such an awkward song never got that one it is just all over the place this album does have some good songs but best of the 90s i am not biting,3.50,378
alrighti give up this is a perfect album i had it at 45 for ages had a dream about radiohead and listened to it this morning from a new perspective and yesthis is one of the greatest albums ever made the problem with albums that you have had for a long time is that sometimes they get under your skin and you can no longer be objective about them fortunately i gained the ability to look at this album freshly again ok computer is perfect,5.00,438
a very good album no doubt about that it just is not as deep and defining as kid a is hence the 45 and not a plain 50,4.50,117
one of the most creative album ever does not sound dated at all right now 10 years after its release my words will not do this album justice some songs might sound boring on its own but put it in context and this is one of the top 5 album of the 90s one of the top 20if not 10 of all time only downside fitter happier is about 130 too long,5.00,339
i have never liked this album aside from radioheads music it does not excite me ok computer is a highly overrated album just like its creators i think there are much better albums than this one and they have never received the recognition they deserve,0.50,251
this cd is interesting it has some really good use of technology and is not cluttered there are some interesting musical ideas and in places it is melodic the overall approach to the recording is nice and it sounds well thought out within it is parameters the sound effects that augment the songs are interesting but the musicianship and vocals lack the drums are a bit too basic and the drummer seems to not venture out into territory other than basic beats the acoustic guitar sounds are nice as are the clean guitar sounds but when the marshall stacks come out it sounds like the guitarists are trying to hide behind distortion rather than use the distortorted sounds to augment the music the backround vocals are very nice very interesting the lead vocals however are often the stereotypical whiney nasal style that pervades in alternative music i do not think the vocals are well produced they do not stick out in the mix and it is impossible to follow the story line of the songs because the words are unintelligable most of the time at times this kind of sounds like abba with not as good of vocals and musical showmanship and it sounds like the music is all done in just a couple of music scales overall the production is quite interesting and the shining element of the cd the musicianship is lacking some but seems adequate for the music much of the time for comparison this sounds like a less ambitious equal to synergy by porcupine tree but overall it is interesting to listen to and is quite inventive at times music that blows me away  as synergy did tends to reach out and grab me even if i am listening to it while doing other things this cd did not do that often and toward the end of it i found myself not paying a lot of attention to it this is nice music but nothing mind boggling i do not understand what the hoopla about it is about on the other hand i do see the appeal to it i think with some better musicianship and some more inventive music that the arrangements would have worked a lot better in fact it sounds almost as if the arrangments are too comlplex for the music and tend to get ahead of the music itself i am glad i heard this and may give it another listen it certainly is a keeper but not exactly the first thing i would reach for when looking for something to listen to in order to stimulate my mind i think this cd could have benefitted with some more eclectic percussion sounds and at times some drums more along the lines of tool and the bass could have been played against the highs a little better if it was a bit beefier,3.00,2565
the first album i ever bought and i have never regretted it this album is easily the best album of 1997 and probably the best album of the 1990s i would also love to say its one of the best albums of all time but that is only in my opinion this album changed my life and this band is easily my biggest musical influence every song is different and every song is amazing highlights for me are let down lucky subterranean homesick alien,5.00,434
i know that it is cliche to give this album five stars seeing as it has been on the top of almost every list of albums from the last 20 years but i do not care i can say without hesitation that this record changed my life while thom and johnny get the most credit i believe that as a whole radiohead has to be the most talented and creative band in existence today,5.00,364
every so often somewhere in the decade an album is released that sets the standard for what and album of that particular genre should consist of these albums push the boundaries and raise the bar for the 60s it would be sgt peppers lonely hearts club band the 70s dark side of the moon the 80s well that ones harder possibly the joshua tree by u2 as for the 90s most people narrow it down to nirvanas nevermind and radioheads ok computer well you can play it safe and narrow it down to halves nevermind defined alternative music for the first half of the 90s however for the second half ok computer came along and blew virtually every listeners minds possibly musicians too including rems michael stripe who calls radiohead impossibly good this album would inspire many of todays artists who base their entire career off of the sound radiohead gave us on ok computer notably artists like coldplay where you can hear that radiohead inspired them some crown it the greatest album of all time many claim it the album of the decade yet i am torn somewhere in between ok computer right from the start is like an ecstatic pulse of joy to the eardrum the songs are undoubtedly nothing short of genius masterworks air bag is about being saved in an automobile accident by an airbag whereas many of the other songs fall along similar subject lines technology being involved in our very lives the sonic spacey guitars of airbag then shift to the modern day masterpiece paranoid android which you might be able to crown as the modern day bohemian rhapsody or happiness is a warm gun considering how it builds and shifts into a mini set of songs paranoid android is undoubtedly my favorite track on the entire album on the very day i purchased the album at this point i was thinking holy  this is amazing already subterranean homesick alien sounds reminiscent of pink floyd if you chopped up dark side of the moon along with your household computer i am sure if it came out as a song this is exactly what it would sound like exit music for a film was cut from the 1997 rendition of romeo and juliet soundtrack for no particular reason other than radiohead liked the song too much to give it up for a soundtrack and i really could not argue with them the track is a slow heartbroken haunting acoustic track where thom yorke whispers over the microphone it is a beautiful experience karma police is a true classic the piano is great it uses violins that notably do not sound like elanor rigby by the beatles which was another first it is undeniably great things then move on to the bone chilling fitter happier which tells the sad story of what is expected from you of society how sad it sounds to leave a perfect life it adds a layer of loneliness to ones public life electioneering has a jerky guitar rhythm and is the most fast paced track on the album no suprises is another one of the better known tracks on the album and is beautiful sounding like the noise the toys that hang over a babys crib makes yet an ultimately dark subject matter i know of no other artists that pull this off so greatly lucky is my second favorite song on the album it tells the story of a man who had just got in a plane crash and survived the album ends and i realize that i may have very well just heard the greatest album of all time every single time the damn thing ends i then want to listen to it over again,5.00,3382
because there are already so many excellent and thorough reviews of this album i will just give a brief account of the impact this music has had on me having purchased the cd on a good friends recommendation in 2005 i was a relative latecomer to radiohead after hearing it about three times in its entirety i realized that i was listening to a work of extraordinarily rare beauty and complexity in fact it had been 30 years since i had experienced anything so stunningly powerful and well crafted and that was led zeppelins towering masterpiece physical graffiti released in 1975 my appreciation and understanding of ok as well as the intensity of enjoyment continues to grow and deepen with each successive spinnow numbering well into the thousands this is an enduring masterwork that holds its own with the very finest music of any genre ever recorded regardless of your particular taste in music give this album a chance and you will be forever glad you did,5.00,960
best album of all time no exceptions i never knew music could be this good and i have been mostly disappointed with every new album i have heard since,5.00,150
no matter where you look this album scores well and i think that is all the credit it needs  brilliant album  when it came out i thought what the f is that favourite songs  lucky airbag paranoid android  closely followed by all the others,4.50,238
it took me about 2 years to get into ok computer and when i finally did understand it i was so thrilled i instantly gave it five stars like over 4000 others have on this site however upon relistening more recently although i do think it is a wonderful album i do not feel it is quite worthy of five stars fitter happier has always been supremely annoying in my opinion and i have gradually got more sick of no surprises so that is the five stars out of the window straight away on the other hand i can find little else to fault here the songs are challenging and progressive but not so much so that they are unlistenable or boring paranoid android is utterly brilliant as is karma police let down and all of the other songs that happen to be amongst my favourite radiohead tracks compared to the previous album ok computer is not as consistently amazing but it works better as a whole album with an overwhelming miserable atmosphere that is far more enjoyable than you might think whether the album really deserves all the acclaim is debatable but i cannot deny just how spectacular ok computer can be,4.50,1101
this edges on musical perfection as far as a rock album goes although i prefer kid a and amnesiac ok computer is an album that i cannot really put below either when over half the songs on the album are favorite songs in general it is hard not to love an album,5.00,259
being the most rated and probably most reviewed album on the site i probably will not have much to add to the reviews here besides my own subjective experiences with ok computer which are fun to share for me but probably boring too read meh i will write something here anyway i myself was born in 1987 so i sort of grew up with radiohead strangely i was never familiar with creep although i must have heard it on the radio more than a couple of times this lead that my first experience with radiohead was their 2 lead singles from this album paranoid android and karma police i loved paranoid android but mostly because of the video for it and my opinion on karma police is kind of forgotten right now but i remember that i found them both beautiful but extreme depressive songs and i loved the name radiohead  the album ok computer came into my life when i was about 14 years old i lend it from my dad and at the time i was totally unaware of the praise it had gotten over the years or even that radiohead was one of the biggest bands of our time i was just a small kid playing nirvana metallica and a little bit of alternative radio friendly music oh and slipknot and korn of course the album did not strike me at all in fact i found it vague depressing and really strange to say the least the only songs i listened to in those times were again to 2 mentioned lead singles and perhaps airbag and exit music for a film now a year of 2 later a friend told me about ok computer and that it was supposed to be the best album of all time according to some polls he saw he himself loved it and said to me that i should give it a try again i of course liked a couple of songs on the album already so i putted the disc in my stereo and started listening i was stunned how beautiful it was and in no time the album was standing in my all time top albums then consisting of nothing more then my good old slipknot korn metallica and nirvana albums with of course metallicas ride the lightning leading it on the number 1 i later on discovered the rest of radioheads catalogue which besides the bends took some time as well to really click with me kid a took like 2 years but it worked the thing i have with radiohead is that every 4 6 months i am craving for the band and i usually end up listening to mostly kid a and ok computer because of the extreme amount of emotion packed into these songs the prime examples on this album are the 2 epics climbing up the walls and lucky which are 2 of my 3 favourite songs on here together with exit music for a film those songs really get to me in a way almost no other piece of music can get to me both songs are songs that i can put on nonstop and it are songs where the solos and climaxes are beyond words in the first mentioned thom yorke even screams the final words which is again beyond words after about 4 years of playing this album to death it still has not give in any of the power it had in fact i now like it even better then say a year before it is like a fine wine that gets better with age but so fine it was already incredible when it was made,5.00,3091
somehow this has snuck up on me after listening to it about ten times at first it seemed outrageously overrated still is but it is really good but the songs seem thrown together and there are some misses the fitter happier bs subterranean homesick alien let down karma police and no surprises are the shining moments 4 stars because there is really only two tracks i do not like the other one being exit music,4.00,409
oh wow this is an absolutely amazing album undoubtedly the best in a long time and definitely one of the most revolutionary with every listen i cannot help noticing another layer of brilliance in each song some might say the bends is better that is just because this is really a very progressive album the greatest every song is amazing i cannot even begin to describe to you the wonderful guitar that opens the album in airbag the beautiful complexity of paranoid android or the shivers up my spine whenever i hear exit music for a film and climbing up the walls which is in my opinion the best song on the album and one of the creepiest ever no pun intended amazing,5.00,667
great album the musical arrangement of karma police sounds exactly like lateera beatles,4.00,87
rating 7804 i am not even going to try to say anything new about this album the second part of the album is not that great i tend to lose interest during electioneering and climbing up the walls absolute classic exit music for a film other great tracks paranoid android karma police fitter happier lucky also airbag subterranean homesick alien let down no surprises,4.00,365
brilliant album i can even call it a legendary one especially airbag paranoid android karma police and lucky really worth hearing,4.50,129
even though i had to listen to it for about a year before i comprehended what was going on ok computer is simply the best record to come out in the 90s some say the best ever it is up there each spin i hear something completely different musically and lyrically i still have not fully developed my own interpretation of the cd i am probably a tool because of that oh well,5.00,371
the opening airbag and the very conceptual paranoid android together are worth 4 stars paranoid android specifically is easily one of the most challenging tracks in latter musical years and proves it possible to blend punk and prog in a same number also i think lucky holds lots of brief passing references to breathe and the narrow way pink floyd and to nothing at all gentle giant the mournful background choir of exit music gets a bit wyattish too but then as with anything by pink floyd and as good as the melodies can get there is still that draggy feeling lurking just around the bend ok computer along with rage against the machine s first and possibly nirvana is one of the very few interesting things to come out of the dormant 90s,4.00,740
best song karma police it is hard for me to say much original about ok computer i have heard before that what songs a person likes the most on this album say a lot about their musical tastes so i will mention my favorite songs from the album first my 1 pick is karma police and i also really like paranoid android let down and no surprises let down and no surprises are the catchiest songs on the album while karma police is a terrific beatles ripoff and i really love the coda paranoid android is pretty scary as is climbing up the walls there are some other interesting things on here too subterranean homesick alien was supposed to sound like miles davis but it came out more like an outtake from the dark side of the moon the tourist also reminds me of pink floyd plus airbag is the only song i know of about surviving a car wreck radiohead have a knack for interesting arrangements on their songs like the glockenspiel on no surprises or the fuzz bass on exit music that i thought was a synthesizer until the internet told me otherwise and i am not the first person to mention that thom yorke only sings the vowels in each word the main problem with this album is the songwriting besides paranoid android my other favorites were the most melodic songs i liked a lot of this album but it could have been a 45 star album if the songwriting were stronger p s why do not i hear radiohead more on the radio they are called radiohead so they should be played more on the radio,4.00,1475
utterly brilliant ethereal voice sometimes bombastic sometimes fragile arrangements and unpredictable the whole time pure magic,5.00,127
the most awesome album ever recorded big call i know but sit down and think about that carefully it is stilll consistant to this very day solid moving scary and extremely well produced,5.00,184
it is a fairly obvious statement to say this is one of the greatest albums of all times but as each year goes by from its release in 1997 its brilliance is amplified quite simply nothing has come close since from any of our supposed great new bands that keep emerging the brilliance is in the innovation the tragedy of the lyrics of a man who has quite simply given up on happiness and the unmistakable melody combined i listened to this album the day my first serious relationship ended my girlfriend was a pretentious one who was full of herself for very little good reason the lyrics her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill have never resonated so well with my thoughts at the time i smoked 20 marlboro lights listened to this album 3 times back to back all of a sudden i knew what it really meant to feel fitter happier more productive,5.00,839
what a fantastic album probably my favourite 90s album here is why airbag great opener and nice lyrics quite sweet too paranoid android no it is not the bo rhap of the 90s fuck off why comapre this great rocksong to the theatrical rockpop classic of the 70s two great songs but so different subterranean homesick alien a grower never used to like this but it has a great sound exit music haunting let down a favourite the vocal parts harmonies as you will at the end are fantastic karma police a perfect single fitter happier more a filler electioneering more rocking a good one but not that special climbing up the walls see electioneering no surpises see karma police lucky second best song on the album quite emotional the tourist the bell at the end is one of the best endings of all album endings as is this whole song,5.00,823
no words to describe the beauty of this work it is simply the sgt peppers lonely heart club band of 90s,5.00,103
oh my god fucking fantastic my favourite song on the album is without a doubt exit music for a film but throughout it i find influences that helped carve olps greatest album and subsequently the greatest album ever spiritual machines artistically ok computer is flawless musically still flawless one of the best albums ever made for sure,5.00,337
this is not surprisingly my favorite radiohead album it is pretty solid from beginning to end and karma police is simply amazing if only the radiohead from 1997 and earlier would come back,4.50,188
an outstanding landmark album so many awesome moments lyrical and musical and great depth in isolation some of the lyrics appear meandering and pretentious but the totality of the lyric works as imagery particularly when the music and lyrics play off each other in a swirling adventure  which is clearly the focus of the album in many respects radiohead has elevated all of poprock as a genre for artistic expression within this album,5.00,434
01  airbag 10 02  paranoid android 10 one of the greatest songs of all time 03  subterranean homesick alien 9 04  exit music for a film 10 05  let down 10 06  karma police 10 one of the greatest songs of all time 07  fitter happier 2 08  electioneering 9 09  climbing up the walls 10 10  no surprises 10 one of the greatest songs of all time 11  lucky 10 12  the tourist 9 overall radioheads best album the best album of the 90s and one of the greatest albums of all time it is very rare that a band can be so varied and still be so brilliant skip fitter happier and you will have nearly the perfect album,5.00,605
i remember rushing out to buy ok computer on the day of it is release i would gotten into radiohead a year or two earlier when i heard the bends another masterpiece i would never really been into british music i was more drawn to what was going on over the water the us provided me with nirvana pearl jam stone temple pilots the afghan whigs screaming trees etc  which appealed to me more but radiohead really blew me away they did not just create an atmosphere through sonic landscapes there was songs and they were outstanding songs the onetwo intro of airbag and paranoid android was daunting and still is subterranean homesick alien exit music and let down were all in someway joyous climbing up the walls was unsettling but extraordinary not to mention karma police no surprises and tourist i still think ok computer is a stunning even haunting record which still stands tall after all this time ok computer gave british music the shot in the arm in badly needed it pushed the boundaries of what musicians could do  why should an ambitious idea remain an ambitious idea make an ambitious record paranoid android daring ambitious and although it is not instantly accessible it is rewarding the computer age indeed without a doubt a classic album a career peak,5.00,1263
there are some amazing songs on here but everything else is just filler the sad thing is that those amazing songs have been killed by too much radio play,3.00,153
greatest album of all time by far thom yorke is my idolevery song is brilliantparanoid android is my favorite song,5.00,114
the only radiohead album that i own but its still pretty good not the perfect album its hyped up to be though,4.50,109
yes karma police is wonderful and there are other songs worth mentioning paranoid android climbing up the walls but after 17 years i still think it is not as good as the majority of people out there believe,3.00,206
this was there first really experimental album and from this album on they only got better and better,5.00,101
hands down the greatest album of all time i have never heard anything like it before and i doubt i ever will again it never gets old no matter how many times i hear it this album is simply perfect,0.50,196
i do not know how to review the album that means more to me than anything else ever recorded especially an album that has been commented on and disected about a billion times before by a billion other people i am not even sure it is as good as the way i feel about it  but does that really matter it is not pretentious or boring as naysayers might try and argue it is a collection of observations basically but not souless intellectual observations that judge rather radiohead acknowledge and infuse a kind of understanding and empathy into stories about people they might not and we may not even understand it is also about the way we cope with the world  by creating a false sense of security airbag to hiding behind materialism until it turns us into monsters paranoid android to dreams of escape exit music subterranean homesick alien feelings of hopelessness and hopefulness mixed together let down rage climbing up the walls and giving up no surprises strip away all the analysis though and you just find some great songs the end of let down is practically transcendent and the it is going to be a glorious day in lucky never ever gets old a perfect album that opened up so many other albums to me,5.00,1203
good album albeit overrated some songs are fantastic though like climbing up the walls exit music and the tourist not the best album of any era but definitely worth a listen by anyone who enjoys music,4.00,200
i am not going to say this is the best album ever and i will probably get shot for it but i do not think it is i like no surprises and karma police and a couple of other individual tracks but the album as a whole seems to vague experimental and upitsownarse for me admittedly it may have more secrets to divulge to me on future spins so i will stay openminded ok now i have lsitened to this more i absolutely love it the gently strummed acoustic guitars in the background throughout the unwavering sense of bleakness and melancholia it is just genius  all of the little bits of random noise contribute the track order is so perfectly crafted above all i love the sense of solitarity and alienation that of being all alone in a world where everyone else seems to be devoting their time to something you do not understand i would say subterranean homesick alien is one of the best due to the capture of this emotion and no surprises also for the ambience of resignation and acceptance let down too but the album as a whole is far grewater than the sum of its parts,5.00,1062
like any good musical art  this is worth listening too just for the experience ,4.50,79
there are very few albums that have affected me as much as ok computer from the first track airbag with its sweeping guitar and hypnotic drum beat the music is brilliant rich atmospheric and enthralling every note sound effect and lyric adds to the whole of this album to create a masterpiece paranoid android is an instant classic a three part epic of isolation and madness there is nothing that is on this album that should not be even fitter happier with its electronic voice and eerie piano makes for an excellent moodestablishing track to begin the albums second half climbing up the walls is a chilling look into the mind of a killer bringing about the highest point of climax on the album though there are many essentially every song is a highlight though my personal favorites are let down and exit music for a film from start to finish i cannot get enough of this album the point buy it nothing comes even close,5.00,920
great album really helped me get to sleep the only lyrics i remember are the ones about the cat tied to the stick i am giving this album extra points for the guest singer on that song they should have him all the time he is way better than their regular guy,0.50,257
not all music has to be uptight but this record is depressing if you do not let it influence you real bad it also contains one of the best emotional mixes of new wave rock electronics and beatlespink floyd like melodies  experimentation it sounds like a constructed painting it deserves to be called albums of the nineties and one of the best records of all time,5.00,362
fucking amazing cd thom yorke is a genious and johnny greenwood is one of the most original guitarists out there,5.00,112
a great classic still considered one of the best records of all time ok computer from the british band radiohead is a great album at the end of the 90s he revolutionized pop music neither more nor less bringing a multitude of ideas and discoveries whether from a sound point of view or in terms of atmosphere because yes ok computer is a work of art to be convinced of this there is nothing like listening in depth to the masterpiece of this album paranoid android its atmosphere its timeless sounds and its amazing voice it is not over exit music for a film leaves stunned with admiration as thom yorke would tear even a tear from the biggest insensitive metalheads the other titles are not to be outdone whether it is the fairly experimental airbag an excellent subterranean homesick alien the smoother let down and karma police the almost joyful and catchy electioneering the mystical climbing up the walls or the no less successful no surprises lucky or the tourist undoubtedly ok computer is one of the milestone albums never has a band sounded like radiohead and never again will anyone sound like ok computers radiohead we can probably remain insensitive to this characteristic coldness for my part i remain impressed by so much talent and mastery,4.50,1254
it is flawless but just does not do anything for me it does not have the it factor,4.50,82
this is not a completely perfect album but most of the songs are wonderful it certainly deserves its place as one of the best albums of all time favorites paranoid android exit music for a film karma police electioneering,4.50,221
to say that ok computer is the best album of the 90s and in some more extreme cases the best album ever have the tendency to work on my nerves but one thing i do agree with is that ok computer is an exceptional release paranoid android remains a musical tour de force to this very day and the simplistic but melodic landscape of songs like karma police and exit music still inspires the album has one weak point and that is the album closer the tourist  it really ends of an other wise flawless album on an extremely dull note i still give ok computer 5 stars since the rest of the album is deserved of this recognition also a sentimental favorite,5.00,647
i will never forget listening to this album with some friends shortly after it came out it was a saturday afternoon we were in my college dorm room the mushrooms were glorious but the music was so much better,5.00,208
deserves all the accolades showered upon it this album along with kid a summarizes the paranoia and uncertainty surrounding the past decade if not the entire information revolution,5.00,180
this album is quite simply perfect it may be depressing but you cannot say it is bad if you do not like this then you do not like music end of discussion,5.00,153
very good learning material for modern young people to make good musicnot best music,3.50,84
this is a 90s classic a true metamorphosis of the band tom york leads radiohead truly through experimentation and it is with this album that they do the most convincing balance between rock music electronic and experimentation this album marks the beginning of a new era of alternative rock and inspired a whole group of bands like early muse coldplay doves just mentioning the main in the top of progressive songs of this album there is paranoid android without a doubt it is a progressive track there is no way to avoid it it is constituted by three different parts the first sadness with a well orchestrated versuschorus pattern the second the explosion in which the guitar the bass and the drums are very well performed and the last the depression with a very moving melancholic cascade of voices following we have the atmospheric subterranean homesick alien and the catchy let down exit music for a film is again a 2 part track with the last being an explosion part like in paranoid android but mainly achieved by emotional vocals the two rockers of the album beyond the supreme paranoid android itself it is the first track airbag which presents a very catchy guitar riff and a great bass work and the almost punky electioneering which could be a song taken from their previous albums the album ends with the trio no surprises lucky and the tourist with the melancholic mode and the imaginative soundscaping that characterizes radiohead karma police is an unforgettable ballad very dramatic extremely beautiful great sonority and without having the prototype of the traditional architecture of a track it is subdivided again in 2 parts a very original crafted lushed album a masterpiece of feeling beauty and melancholy it changed music,4.50,1742
quite simply the most beautiful music ever created in rock and roll history it takes you through a range of emotions and i come back to it again and again,5.00,154
well let us just say it is not my kind of music classics are classics and this one fits in rightly with loveless from my bloody valentine amongst the making elaborate songs does not necessarily equals good music category for good noiserock or whatever this genre is called go for sonic youths trilogy evol sister daydream nation and goo instead,2.50,344
quite possibly the greatest album of all time personally i prefer their album the bends but there really is not much to choose between the two superb,5.00,149
this is closely behind radioheads kid aamnesiac releases my second favourite album ever i will not try to describe what makes radiohead so great to listen to numerous music critics have tried and failed just take my word for it and buy this album then buy kid a,5.00,261
fitter happier annoys me so much that i cannot give it 5 stars but i would give it 499 if possible the most influential album of 1990s do not even talk about nirvana  where is grunge now favorite track karma police,4.50,214
up until the last couple months i have only heard ok computer in airportstrain stations for the last 5 years in an age when everyone has an opinion on ok computer it is the only way to keep it safe and sacred to me since it is gone from being one of the best albums of the 90s to one of the best albums ever over the last couple of years the counterculture crowd have not been kind to radiohead and their magnum opus i cannot imagine how awful it would be to hear this album at the wrong moment in the wrong environment and hear it as rolling stones 162 album of all time or even worse over hyped garbage i feel ok computer has done so much for me on a emotional and imaginative level that at the very least i can do is protect it from the outside worlds opinions that i was oblivious to as a kid i never fully got the concept of a band by the time i was 10 even though my brother had one and i had a favorite band i think superdrag i still did not get the concept entirely radiohead only furthered this weird state of mind as i spotted posters and icons that connected to the band i went to a friend of a friends house who had a ok computer poster on his wall i cannot explain the feeling it gave me to see it it was like he had the mark of cain and we all belonged to some club that was meant for something more in the world vhs tapes that say radiohead on it weird tshirts my brother would wear with hand breaking glass that said radiohead and this ugly cover with a babys face i was given as a present that said radiohead on it perhaps in the same way growing up with the beatles might have done finding ok computer at such an early age gave me such a unexplainable excitement on what art can do and be it felt more like a movement to save the world at the end of the century and we all were going to be apart of it aside from becoming a cure for insomnia in 97 it became the soundtrack to going in and out of airports and train stations such an exciting wonderful place where cold industrial design makes the light come in like a ray of heaven all the strange noises and announcements sounding far from human but resembled us well enough the people going in and out of my life at an overwhelming rate it was a place that made everything seem possible and probable watching it all go by to the soundtrack of ok computer just clicked with me on such a deep level and still does to see so many people in such a detached state in one of the most curious places you can be could you imagine what people from past generations would think of these establishments was as wonderful as it seems scary now i cannot talk about how selway implemented dj shadow breaks and loops in the drums or how greenwoods use of guitar effects are beyond anything else ever as the album will never speak to me that way and i never would want it to what i can talk about is how odd my connection to the album is nearly 10 years later it is made me recall many things i have forgotten that i guess i kept to myself in the airportstrain stations like how i was 100 convinced i was an alien until i was 12 and was ready to be brought home any moment or how i saw the boogyman standing next to my bed watching me sleep within my dreams various times i guess now it would be about alienation and the boogyman is the government putting cameras everywhere but there is something still very tangible and haunting in those earlier beliefs ok computer will always be a huge chunk of escapism in my life i would not be surprised if i have a midlife crisis one day and sleep at an airport terminal for a night playing ok computer much like laughing stock and in the aeroplane over the sea ok computer takes me so deep into a world i can never compare to the one i currently occupy i guess the thing that makes it better is that it feels like i am returning to something at the same time contains lyrics album artpackaging a rent or buy buy,5.00,3905
one of the most accessible and catchy albums of alltime i am a huge catchysong fan and it took me two listens to fall in love with ok computer just make sure the second listen takes place at night when you are cold and alone and a little bit lonely when there are strangers around me i strongly feel like singing these songs this is what you get this is what you get rain down rain down from a great height from a great height height i lost myslf i lost myself one of the best things is lyrics often come in pairs so the people around me are guaranteed to hear them it feels so good to force these songs into their ears one of the most beautiful creations music has seen quote from another review also this might sound weird but there is a video game that i suggest every ok computer fan play it is system shock 2 on pc reasons 1 the game is also dark and scary 2 the game has a similar themetopic to ok computer 3 ok computer is no 9 album of alltime system shock 2 is no 15 pc game of alltimeaccording to gamerankingscom both are extremely wellmade products with very deep contents 4 ok computer released in 1997 system shock 2 in 1999 5 computer and system a good match 6 ok and shock subtle connections exist 7 i experienced them in the same december it almost feels like they are the same eternity just in different formsrock music and computer game just do not play the game while listening to the album the game has techno soundtracks of its own,4.00,1452
i can not say anything about this album that someone else has not mentioned prior easily one of the best albums of the 90s not my personal choice but i would not argue that this is not the best from the 90s either,5.00,213
a perfect modern soundtrack to a dystopia some of the most haunting yet beautiful rock music ever penned,5.00,104
how did they manage to get it so damn right in the middle of that impossible decade and 10 years later it is still right  untainted by zillions of opinions and attempts at jarring that essence it must have been divine intervention because they never came this close to bliss anymore no wait i am an atheist it must be survival of the fittest tune then,5.00,351
i bought this album after buying the bends and pablo honey back then i had only partially listened to those albums but at one point i used to listen to the bends before going to sleep i had already listened to no suprises and karma police previously and had heard alot of people banging on about paranoid android subterranian homesick alien the title partially stolen from a bob dylan song but not to the extent that it is black market oasis stolen is probably my favourite track on the album probably because it is as ambient and dreamy as songs from the bends probably the main reason why i returned this cd to ask for my money back was because of all the indie kids and art school assholes who bang on about radiohead radioheadradioheadradioheadradioheadradioheadradiohead but also because the album itself did not do anything for me i felt bored and sleepy do not know maybe it is me maybe someone should slap me something silly i cringe everytime i hear climbing up the walls because i think of all the music nuts in japan going waahhh everytime the singer mouths the first vocals i myself could not make an album to save my life unless i told the everyone it was intended as an ironic joke and i can perhaps grasp the strain etc this band were under while making it but it is not something i would class as one of the greatest of all time to others perhaps but not myself thanks before i even listened to radiohead the name did make me vision a group who is music is a fusion of rock electronica,3.00,1501
folk may criticise this because it is so popular and so highly acclaimed but the fact remains that this is a stunning album consistently brilliant just listen to the triplet of electioneering climbing up the walls and no surprises and you cannot deny the power and emotion,5.00,272
this is truely a masterpiece and my favorite album from the 90s almost every song is excellent so please listen to this you probably will not regret it the song i like the most no surprises,5.00,189
goddamn music videos are influencial,1.00,36
if its 2007 and you are looking at reviews for ok computer and you have not heard it its very important that you do it will change the way you look at popular music,5.00,164
this might be the only album that it took me awhile to get into that was actually worth the effort at first the only songs i really liked were let down karma police and no surprises in particular climbing up the walls just sounded like noise but it revealed itself to have an amazing melody after several listens nearly all the songs were masterpieces airbag leads things off with a somewhat triphop sound although i am not that much a fan of the first and third sections of paranoid android it has one of my favorite guitar solos of all time and no matter what the band says i maintain that it is about the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy lucky contains thoms greatest vocal performance of the album the tourist is a bit dull but serves as a perfect ending to the album and contains some fabulous guitar from i assume johnny,5.00,825
maybe there is no hope for society after all maybe the human race is fated to selfdestruct in a blaze of glory without ever having understood its purpose or meaning in this strange existence it hardly matters though because the beauty of life itself has a way of transcending its torments and ok computer teaches us how unmistakably true this is in a world of escalating superficiality and materialism radiohead were able to depict so intricately and beautifully the collective psyche of our current reality and the pitfalls of the direction we are headed in the most special thing about ok computer is radioheads ability to channel the feelings of society and express it in such a real and affecting way this album is not about thom yorke or the bands other members it is about our collective dynamic with the world we live in it is a kind of musical mirror of the thread of feelings that runs through us all even if we are not conscious of them what makes ok computer more formidable is the vibrant and mesmerizing energy created by its power and spirit of truth it is an energy i want to get lost in because the realness and and specialness of it will never be matched by the world as we know it it gives me enough distance to help me achieve a clearer perspective on life and what i want out of it which is the overall spiritual effect ok computer has had on me that is the mystery and the beauty of it the mystery being how ok computer let us you understand life more clearly while letting you escape from it and the beauty being that when you see reality as it is it loses its ability to harm you metaphysically everything everyone everywhere needs to listen to this,5.00,1672
ok ok computer okc is in case you did not know one of the best albums of the 90s along with classics like nevermind nima or one of massive attack the album itself is not as solid as you might think but its songs are so powerful so beautiful that it is hard not to love things like karma police paranoid android no surprises and my favorite let down an album of great beautiful songs added to the typical radiohead experimentation make this one of the best albums i have ever heard there are some things that are left over lucky airbag fitter hapier the tourist but the rest are very very good songs paranoid android is a song in three parts which combines melancholy with danceable rhythms exit music is a totally hypnotic and depressive song a great song let down is a very important song in my life how many times have i cried just listening to it karma police is an anthem electioneering is the most up on the album climbing up the walls is scary no surprises is one of radioheads most beautiful all in all a great great album,4.00,1029
this is an amazing album there is not a single bad track here and even if there was i would not care because it works well as one big unit tracks like airbag and exit music for a film are epics and no surprises is heartbreakingly beautiful this is the only album i own besides the soft bulletin by the flaming lips and maybe yoshimi that can get me emotional plus climbing up the walls is genuinely scary that is cool,5.00,417
after owning the album for almost five years hearing it in buts and pieces for jsut as long hearing it in its entirety a couple times tonight is the first time i have ever listened to it fully i get it now i never understood the praise piled upon it but now it is all too clear a perfectly composed and solemn symphony of brooding sound one of the albums we would have to put in a time capsule for being a great example of its time and era,5.00,439
i 19971998 i witnessed the wonderful video for ok computer really seriously this was one of the most innovative albums since blurs earlier work among other artists i had heard in the 90s not because of the complicated instrumentation chords and vocals no it was no beck no reinvention it was something so new this album is not something to jump around to  this is an album to frame on a wall forever repeating,5.00,409
this is not dark side of the moon of the nineties truly an outstanding album but for me it seems to be a bit just a bit overrated i am not really keen on yorkes vocalizing his voice makes it pure psychedelic sounding it is a fact paranoid android exit music for a film karma police love the video very much just like of paranoid android climbing up the walls no surprises and the tourist are definitely brilliant tracks both musically both in production the rest is weaker in places i am very much fond of progressive music also those of the modern sounding but this records after several years of owning listening could not really grow on me that is why i did not dare to try their later more experimental albums so far probably that day will come once,4.00,753
i think the trick behind this album is that it is so wellproduced that most listeners take the weak spots  and there are a lot  too literal and see them as part of the limbo atmosphere,3.50,184
great album most of these songs are excellent it is not in the top 10 albums of all time or anything but definitely the top 100 the piano in karma police sounds exactly like sexy sadie on the beatles white album,4.50,211
just listening to this for the first time in ages why oh why had i marked it down as only 45 fixed probably the best produced album i have ever heard,5.00,149
the greatest album of all time every track is absouloutly perfect the only word to describe this is perfectthom yorke is a geniusbest tracks are no surprisesparanoid android and exit music but every track is just as good as these really,5.00,236
dark side of the moon for my generation,5.00,39
one of the few radiohead albums that actually gets the credit it deserves ok computer is one of the greatest albums i have ever layed ears on,5.00,141
an album full of quality good taste noises that are part of us sensitivity 5 out of 5,5.00,85
they have almost overproduced the life out of this album but it is still a monumental work what other band could include such a diverse range of tracks from the multisection progressive paranoid android through the computervoiced fitter happier to the gentle ballad no surprises and have it all work and fell like a coherent piece of work if you like this and you do not know much of the rest of their work i recommend skipping to hail to the thief rather than the less accessible kid a and amnesiac and then going back to them it is more of a progression than the timebased sequence,4.50,583
all of the hype is true this is really one of the most amazing albums ever made not being much of an alternative fan at the time i was skeptical about an album made in 1997 getting all of the praise it got i got it and listened to it and pretty much like airbag and paranoid android and forgot about it for awhile i picked it up again months later and i am glad i did every song is fantastic whether it is rocking emotional atmospheric chilling or epic you are going to be feeling something special during each and every one of these songs save obviously fitter happier airbag is at truly unique sounding song that must be heard paranoid android defines epic and has a riff at one point that rivals the riff used at the climax of bohemian rhapsody aka massive head bang subterranean homesick alien is worthy of floyd exit music is chilling and dark let down is wonderfully dreamy karma police i cannot really describe the emotion it is like epic in a short amount of time when it gets to the end its just incredible electioneering is a bit too rocking for this album but its still fun to listen to climbing up the walls is dark and creepy and took me awhile to get into but still great track to listen to no surprises reminds me of the dreamy style of let down except dreamier lucky is a bleak song until the chorus which is so lush it gives you chills the tourist is an epic closer with some fantastic vocals one of the few overhyped albums out there deserves every bit of praise its given i wish more modern bands could take a cue from radiohead this album gives me hope for the future of music i am seriously proud to be a fan of this album and hope that this album can reach others and touch them as it did me,5.00,1713
i have owned ok computer since the week it came out and i am a little surprised how it has grown in stature left for dead by the public upon its initial release but not critics ok computer quickly became the best album of alltime when the 14 yearolds of 97 started up their blogs and webzines in the 00s to me the sound of the record is too cold between no surprises and the computervoiced fitter happier ok computer seemingly is the sound of losing all hope and wallowing in it though very well done wallowing perhaps some will see it as a call to arms but i do not know even yorkes vocals on exit music for a flim suggests that he is worn out and has given up when the lyrics suggests that he should be fighting for his love juliet it is just that even at my most cynical i hold on to shreds of optimism and i guess i want that reflected in my music as well i saw radiohead in concert back in june because i had access to some tickets and i looked into the crowd during paranoid android and it seemingly was a group of people that collectively feel disaffected by and powerless against their surroundings perhaps it is a feeling that i sometimes share but not necessarily one i want to augment of course this review may seem contradictory to my 45 rating of the bends and my 40 review of the eraser but the former rawks a lot more than ok computer and there is a sense of humanity in the eraser i just do not think i could ever embrace something this bleak,3.50,1458
here you go this record changed my life well it was the cassette but then i got the cd twice i think i cannot say anything about ok computer except that if you have not heard it you are an alien ah no they have heard it too,5.00,223
this album saved my life while contemplating suicide in early 2001 i felt as if the world was against me that technology in general would get the best of humanity then my friend gave me this album i realized that i was not alone in my way of thinking that it was okay because in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe this album is a great story from beginning to end it will take atleast 15 listens to get but be patient you will get there i suggest smokin a spliff or have a few glasses of wine just to relax to be able to focus then finally you will be able to swallow that you are right technology will take us over but we can still be happy til then,5.00,668
a masterpiece a classic up there with the best of the 60s and 70s rock the greatest artistic achievement of the 90s and second most important record of the decade after nirvanas nevermind  which arguably lead the way into mainstream to the entire altrock scene radiohead included as every well crafted concept album the whole album is greater than the simple sum of each song plus this one is practically flawless not every song is great in itself but each one concurs to the perfect flowing of sound from the starting crunching guitar to the final tinkle of a triangle the tracklist airbag 45  awesome drum and bass lines a great start which makes the listener aware that something has changed from the bends paranoid android 5  simply astonishing a work of art period subterranean homesick alien 4  dylanian title and typical rhish atmosphere mellow and dreamy great arrangement and awesome lyrics exit music for a film 45  starts with a minimal acoustic riff and bursts into a wonderful crescendo let down 35  excellent melodic track but it lacks something to call it great karma police 5  another classic personally i prefer a few other rh songs than this one but you simply cannot rate it other than 5 fitter happier na  not being a real song it is difficult to rate anyway it is not a filler it perfectly fits its slot and the lyrics are pure ace electioneering 4  the rock track outstanding guitar riff  and final threeguitar jam climbing up the walls 4  noisy spooky and beautiful another little work of art no surprises 5  absolutely perfect my favourite track lucky 45  a classic style ballad excellent solo by jonny greenwood the tourist 35  written by jonny greenwood it is good but i find it a little monotonous thus the notsobrilliant rating,5.00,1755
their best record and coming from an outstanding band a masterpiece for me it is hard to decide between ok and kid a because they are quite different but both are perfect ok computer combines rock with some electronic touches and the fusion is amazing the lyrics awesome too for example listening to exit music for a film makes me feel like i am on this song an odd but beautiful feeling the best song is paranoid android and i think it is the best radiohead song although i like more others airbag is one of the best opening tracks ever,5.00,537
good but not great and only mildly daring thom yorke style plaintive wail replaces butt rawk howl as overdone vocal trend of the decade but howling can sometimes be impressive nice production on ok computer and at times quite rocking some good musical ideas but listening to this album is a bit of a chore overall not particularly enjoyable or inspiring based on rym ratings quite overrated too much vague ranting not enough hope or solutions cold and rather devoid of any emotional resonance if thom yorke really despises the modern conditions the world is in what is he doing using an arena rock band with all modern electronic conveniences it is these contradictions that are the same failing as dark side of the moon if yorke cares so much he should pick up a fiddle shut up play jigs dance and give people something worth living for pink floyd already made bloated stiff albums in the mid 70s ok computer really is dark side of the moon part two anyone who thinks this is one of the all time greats has not explored enough music even radiohead would go on to do slightly better why be afraid get out of your head and dance a bit,3.00,1133
beautiful mindbending stuff here from radiohead it is well known as their best ever record and although i can see why that decision is made by many i personally prefer kid a this is a record that will favourite record or not continue to return to your cdplayer time after time,5.00,276
radioheads 1997 release ok computer has been their most critically acclaimed and wellreceived album to date it brings the band into a whole new world of music abandoning for the most part their earlier hardpoprock persona for an easier electronicprogressive like tone it has been decided many times to be the greatest album of all time by various critics and music magazines this is the mostown radiohead album and is a great purchase for a music fan of any genre most recommended songs 1 paranoid android 2 karma police 3 no surprises 4 exit music for a film 5 electioneering,5.00,576
what can i say about this album that has not been said before without hyperbole it is one of the legitimate top ten albums of the 20th century it is one of the few albums that has been loved by both the public and the critics and is rightly portrayed as the most influential hour of music the 90s gave us every song is a gem  even the weakest track climbing up the walls is essential the first six songs take you to that state of mental bliss that only music has the ability to do starting with airbag soaring through paranoid android and ending with karma police  i doubt there has been a stronger first half of an album on any record the second half is not as good as the first half but it is still fantastic fitter happier is a disturbing interlude and electioneering is just brutal no surprises has one of the creepiest riffs i have ever heard while lucky sounds like the soundtrack to a widescreen production of the apocalypse that might sound cheesy but when you hear it you will know what i mean the album finishes with the tourist and ends with a single tap of a xylophone never before has one note sounded so mighty in short everything you need to know about this album has been said many many times just believe the hype  it is all true,5.00,1246
this album lives up to every superlative anyone has ever thrown at it rock it,5.00,77
no question about it this is a very good album but i cannot for the life of me figure out why it is considered the best of the 90s ndash or even the best of 1997 either this album is not nearly as good as people think it is or i am missing something big it is probably the latter,4.00,279
i never understood what many listeners find outstanding in this group the material is mostly boring and monotonous the performance skills are also not outstanding it is incomprehensible i think the popularity in this case is explained primarily by promotion in glam magazines for all the time the group has only one outstanding track  creep definitely one of the most overrated bands in the history of rock music if we talk about this album then it is certainly the strongest of the band there are even some strong songs such as paranoid android and karma police 7 out of 10,3.50,574
no album can be to everyone tastes but it takes a special album to be loved by a large majority of the public ok computer is one of those special albums it is one of the most critically praised albums of all time while there are still some people who see the album as overrated radiohead have created an album that is amazingly beautiful and dreary most people will find a lot to love about ok computer whether it be the epic paranoid android the scary climbing up the walls the beautiful no surprises or any of the other magnificent tracks ok computer is enjoyed by many people all over the world and deserves every accolade it receives,5.00,637
a masterpiece i could never get tired of it paranoid android which contains a similitude with the pretty thingss in the square  1970 exit music climbing up the walls airbag karma police no surprisesgreat ,5.00,204
ok computer could be described as noiserock it is not your regular rock music it is kind of intellectual not always melodic rarely pretty but usually interesting thom yorke the android doing most of the programming whines his way through the songs his singing probably makes the album even less accessible than does the challenging nature of the music the songs seem to fall into two basic camps pained and depressed on the one hand and sceptical and faithless on the other in the first category are exit music for a film and the totally depressed sounding let down in the second category are paranoid android karma police and fitter happier not so much a hidden track as a smallprinttrack on my cd electioneering is the closest radiohead get to rocking out and the topic is punk in character  skepticism directed at politicians what is clear from the songs is that radiohead are disillusioned and disenchanted with the world around them and this to such an extent that even a song entitled lucky sounds as if it sung by the unluckiest person on earth finally in tourist they tell us to slowdown that is a piece of advice most of us could do well to follow in our hectic timepressured lives all in all it is pretty glum listening something for a damp grey winters day maybe it is not totally without reward for the listener but there is much easier gratification to be found elsewhere plus you do not have to listen to yorkes singing,3.00,1433
funnysometimes i think it is overratedbut i always come back to itgreat albumtakes repeated listens to likebut once you like it you can see what the hype was all about every song is an experience and it was unlike anything that came out that year,5.00,246
pull me out of the aircrash the bends had established radiohead as an important band but the trouble was that it was a fullyformed realisation of their sound so they had to look beyond the realms of ordinary guitar rock for their next album ok computer confirmed radioheads staying power and gave them a permanent reservation to dine at rock musics toptable after the musical conservatism that had been the trademark of far too much british guitar music in the mid 90s ok computer was an album of vaulting ambition which caused rock bands around the world to take a long hard look at themselves and wonder why they had not thought of that ok computer was by turns rocking tender terrifying and utterly depressing which was more than enough to lodge in the psyche of every moody and disenchanted soul in their late teens and early twenties radiohead had become the voice of a generation by pointing out that we are all going to hell in a handcart ok computer is a musically inventive intelligent and hugely pretentious album it is progrock reinvented for the new millennium something which left marillion trying to claim that they had been doing it for years they had not it has guitar anthems like electioneering no surprises is a twisted nightmare of a lullaby lucky and paranoid android are songs which make the best of their complex arrangements and fitter happier is a peptalk typed out in simpletext with speach enabled cast just were not capable of stuff like this there is a downside though such musical invention led to radiohead sounding even more smug than usual which is something of a turn off for me yes it is a clever album but is there any need to be so bloody selfsatisfied about it thom yorkes vocals in particular suffer from his desire to deliver everything in angstridden whine instead of delivering the lyrics in a clear and understandable manner personally i think yorke sounded better on the bends perhaps this is unfair nitpicking ok computer is unarguably one of they key albums of the 90s as it encouraged all manner of bands to raise their respective games it could be argued that ok computers inventiveness revealed the inherent deficiencies in so many subpar british guitar bands which caused so many of these bands to eventually split due to lack of public interest what cannot be argued is that it made ambitious rock fashionable again ambition makes you look pretty ugly,3.50,2402
well here is trouble fact is i admire radiohead yet i do not really like radiohead i can appreciate all the great reviews yet somehow as a whole they leave me cold i find myself on the outside wondering what all the fuss is about as for the band so for this album there are several tracks i think are wonderful  no surprises karma police exit music for a film  but in the end it is like trying to worship in a gothic cathedral you admire the achitecture yet cannot help noting that it is too damn cold for comfort is ok computer a good album yep a great album sure one of the greatest well ,4.00,590
this was my first radiohead album and their earliest 90s rock stuff had a big effect on me when i was 13 or 14 i remember i bought this album asked my dad to put it on in the car and then took it into the house and did not stop playing it for weeks on end then when kid a clicked it lost its shine and i end up here today enjoying only a handful of songs on it and letting it go a historic album sure but one that did not particularly age well i never play this any more and i do not particularly miss it,4.50,504
truly a masterpiece ok computer is the only album i could honestly say is the most perfect album out there from thom yorkes vocals to the instrumentals greatest album of the 90s if not ever,5.00,189
this album is oozing so much quality it is hard to believe that it all exists on one cd ok computer proves that radiohead are a great band,5.00,138
consider the lot you must have heard about this album already sure it is often surrounded by an unbelievably high wall of pretenses what we are all saying when we unanimously endorse the greatness of this album is this let this album happen to you seriously,5.00,257
although the bends radiohead released two years earlier they were stars it was only 1997 that turned out to be a breakthrough for this formation first there was a phenomenal concert at the glastonbury festival which was considered the best concert of all time and then the ok computer premiere radiohead musicians decided to develop the themes started with planet telex and street spirit and refine the sound by adding various futuristic sounds the effect is electrifying which was also appreciated by the critics the album received maximum marks almost everywhere and the audience it even surpassed the bends commercially surprisingly because i do not have any potential hits on it there is however everything else from an extensive suite paranoid android to a fantastic ballad exit music each of the songs has become an anticommercial anthem they were unmatched then they were far behind the competition and yet the awards for the album of the year were won by the verve for urban hymnes time however works in favor of ok computer and after many years the album is listened to even better and today it is difficult to imagine another album at the top of the ranking for the best albums of the nineties absolutely deserved of course,5.00,1233
i do not think there is a soul alive that has not heard this album classical fans heavy metalists many genres of music all say this is one hell of an album this has been voted best album ever many times by many reviewers magazines and chart shows i can see this point of view but i honestly just think that kid a and amnesiac combined are better,4.00,345
arguably the most important and influential album of the past 20 years ok computer is filled with part ambient experimental part rock and indie tracks to make it a finely crafted masterpiece the standout song is paranoid android which is a 6 12 minute track filled with musical genius every other track is also very powerful lyrically and musically most notably karma police and let down,5.00,387
the third verse of let down is simply the greatest ever moment in music other orgasmic moments it is going to be a glloooooooorrriouuss daayyy such a pretty house and such a pretty garden exit music from 248 onward  i could go on all day,5.00,237
one of the best albums ever i love it like mad you can listen to it and feel something no matter what mood your in best tracks airbag paranoid android let down no suprises the tourist,5.00,183
i used to really enjoy this album but it is not aging well too derivative in a few years radiohead will not even be on the radar anymore,0.50,136
bomb bomb bomb bomb chinak un dei du dei du dei dou ambuj zig mig lichat in ninda nazzat vert ver ma undevares jegrat jatranova ough that speech go,5.00,147
the most overrated album of alltime is surprisingly still a great album plenty to enjoy on here including climbing up the walls one of my favorite radiohead songs the bends is definitely better a better album from front to back though seriously though 9 alltime this is supposedly better than who is next and velvet underground and nico no chance in hell,4.00,354
a fourstar album like any other a lot of good stuff and some notthatgood stuff,4.00,78
sad songs played beautifully with soaring epic instrumentation lucky and subterranean build up in an indescribably emotional way that splits me wide open every time i hear them and i will never tire of the way those songs make me feel,5.00,234
when i first heard this album i just thought that it was overrated nerd music it still is but this appeals to the lonely nerd within everyone,5.00,141
after all these yearsi have come to realise ok computer may be my least favorite radiohead album why perhaps because i know it inside out perhaps also because it has simply worn out on me ok computer is radioheads third and most successful album to date it has been praised as one of the top 10 indie albums of all time by many music critics it contains the hits paranoid android karma police and no surprises an album that came at the right time between the development of prog rock the end of alternative rock and the birth of the eworld it marks the perfect moment where human kind was being confonted to fear and alienation now when i listen to it it really sounds like an indie album and nothing much more i guess this means that radiohead has really developed and matured and that they are no oasis or blur musically this album contains some of radioheads most well known songs airbag paranoid android exit musicfrom romeo and juliet karma police and no surprises the best track on here would have to be lucky which set the tone nicely for what was to come and there is also fitter happier is an absolute stroke of genious something which was going to be further developed in kid a despite this this is no doubt radioheads best perhaps on par with kid a each song is an absolute classic minus the minor dissapointments let down and the non ear pleasing electioneering and we all know this  i am just saying what i feel about the album after all these years,5.00,1462
although i think this is like the most overrated album ever i can see why let down is my favorite song they all are pretty good,5.00,127
consumerism globalisation postmodernism social alienation depression paranoia the themes of the album although never being a part of a concept have stood the test of time and are as relevant as they were back in 1997 by keeping its relevance ok computer has become one of the most important albums of our time although influenced by several musicians of different styles like miles davis krzysztof penderecki the beatles and dj shadow ok computer cannot be compared to any other album it is unique and innovative to an extent yet not completely revolutionary it is atmospheric and beautiful in it is own way yet not everyone is cup of tea despite all its paradoxes ok computer could quickly acclaim the classic status by music critics and mutual admiration amongst fans from the very beginning of airbag the adventurous mood is set and it guides us through the whole album without being absent even for a second it is only the listener and the music and nothing in between even the six and a halfminute long the modern guitar rock classic paranoid android sounds too short as the album progresses and arrives to probably the best combo on the whole album hopeless exit music for a film and completely alienated and instrument preferred let down the two songs have almost nothing alike yet they flow together in the best possible way the first half of the album ends with pianobased beatlesque sexy sadielike karma police which is probably the most accessible and radiofriendly composition here from fitter happier to climbing up the walls ok computer is at it is darkest and most disturbing before arriving to it is climax as yorkes effortless voice in the xylophonedriven and poignantly beautiful no suprises almost whispers a heart that is full up like a landfilla job that slowly kills you i will take a quiet life a handshake of carbon monoxidewith no alarms and no surprises as jonny greenwoods guitars almost crying on lucky and the tourist the album gets it to closing act leaving no regrets in the listener who is begging for an encore musically of course it is always been an important and an enormously influential modern rock album as the huge number of radioheadcopycats has shown us still ok computer is in the league of it is own never having to confront a follower that could have matched the standard set by thom yorke and co it is not even radioheads best album but no other release by them sounds as refreshing and uplifting after neglecting it for some period of time ok computer still remains one of the best albums ever recorded,5.00,2549
i think it is very difficult to refute that radiohead are the best band to come out of the 90s the lyrics are awesome the instruments are masterfully played thom yorke scares the shit out of me when he sings this album is their highest point the songs are very diverse from a sense of rebirth to bitterness to paranoia best tracks airbag electioneering no surprises,5.00,365
a truly brilliant record one of the best albums in history the record came at the right time with songs dosed in the right way the band will hardly reach the level they reached with this masterpiece no track is irrelevant perhaps tourist and fitter happier but the album as a whole has so many gems that it would be redundant to list almost the entire track listing paranoid android is the prototype of an almost perfect track complex and creative without being boring creative exciting moving arrangements form the frame of this sound delight as the critic zeca camargo said in the review of this record the record is so exciting that the review should have been published in playboy and not in bizz hehehe,5.00,707
this one starts with one of the greatest opening tracks ever they find the right combination between alternative pop  rock then paranoid android starts when you think of paranoid android with great drums and lyrcis like when i am king you the first against the wall subterranean homesick alien to me the best song of the album i know hardly everyone would disagree but it is my opinion then a song written for romeo  julia comes up called exit music for a film so fucking great the lyrics make laugh everytime i hear it then the best ong lyrical shows up called let down karma police is the pop songs of the album what creep  high  dry where for the earlier albums filter happier is a stupid skit enough a bout that next songs electioneering it is too hard for me but i can understand much people like it climbing up the walls it is different from other songs of the album but i would say electioneering is a good intro to this song the rhythm and the lyrics of the main part usually remain in your mind for a while if you listen to this song for a few times no surprises is not very specil the album ends with one of the best songs on the album  lucky 5 stars for ok computer,5.00,1176
i came to be a radiohead fan a quite late i would seen them live back in 93 or 94 when they were touring in support of pablo honey and i did not think much of them to me they sounded like english grunge posers who would gotten lucky with a pretty cool song with creep in comparison to pearl jam who i also saw live around that time they were just pretenders that was the end of that for me for quite some time in 2001 after reading a few gushing reviews that i frankly thought must have been some kind of a joke i bought a copy of ok computer to hear this so called masterpiece for myself imagine my surprise then when i heard the beginning of the opening track airbag with it is distorted guitar cellos and tripped out drums of course it did not stop there every track was a revelation every track was beautiful in some new and mystifying way of course i immediately realized the error of my ways and have ever since regretted dismissing radiohead so out of hand oh woe is me,4.50,976
absolutely amazing transports you to another world not so different from our own and you can feel the cold superficial emptiness of modern life perfectly immortalised in this record this is one of the greatest albums ever made and is truly the revolver of the 90s,5.00,263
still trying to get this one it is an interesting listen that i plan to revisit but at this point i just do not see what all the hoopla is about still like kid a and the bends much better,3.50,187
i am kicking myself for not listening to radiohead sooner i heard people say they were overrated so i did not bother those people are wrong this album deserves all the praise it gets and if you have not had a listen i would suggest you do this album is loaded with great songs and absolutely no filler minus fitter happier maybe 1 airbag 1010 2 paranoid android 1010 3 subterranean homesick alien 910 4 exit music for a film 910 5 let down 1010 6 karma police 1010 7 fitter happier 610 8 electioneering 710 9 climbimg up the walls 1010 10 no suprises 1010 11 lucky 910 12 the tourist 1010,5.00,588
my second favorite radiohead album i love listening to this album and knowing where the band was going musically this album is a cornerstone for there career and made them to what they are today,4.00,194
so i have been given an assignment to review two albums in my collection that i have rated similarly and eventually pick which is my favorite the records chosen for me are radiohead ok computer and wire 154 both of which at the time i had rated 3 stars my first impression of the records and this assignment before going back to listen to them was that these two records mark the turning points of both these bands which was partly the reasoning behind the choice of these albums but on a more personal level this is also the point in which i quit listening to both of these bands which probably has a lot to do with my original 3 star rating of each of these albums i know people who will sing the praises of both of these bands after these points but i could never get into their later stuff upon listening to these records again i could not help but realize i was wrong on my original ratings i cannot help but wonder if that was not part of why these records were chosen for me i cannot remember ever enjoying 154 as much one thing that i noticed about both of these records is that this is where both of these bands started to use electronics wire goes for a much darker sound while radiohead uses it more in the background to highlight the songs all in all if i have to chose one over the other it would have to be this radiohead album largely because i believe that this is the high point of their career while wire was never quite able to live up to pink flag though chairs missing was close in fact i probably overlooked 154 all these years because i wanted another pink flag when the only way to truly appreciate it is by keeping it separate and letting it stand alone but in the end i have a renewed appreciation of both these albums and i now think they are both great,4.50,1780
ok computer is an absolutely fascinating album it is one of those you listen to and really cannot believe what you have just heard rich deep melodic and beautiful,5.00,162
everything i could possibly say about this album has already been said over the past 9 years however everything i could possibly say about this album would be to the point of urging you to own this album this album is as essential as they make out,5.00,247
i think this is a growersleeper of an album upon the first listening i kind of went ahuh it is ok nice lush sounds etc but it did not grab me  yet but i am willing to give it a change to grow on me,3.50,197
if only this album was not so well know then it would definetly be the highest ranked album on this website with a rating in the region of 475,5.00,142
fitter happier more productive a pig in a cage on antibioticsthe poem of the end of the century a conceptual masterpiece a literary landscape of cyberpunk modern society cold disinterested ultratechnological productivist consumerist suffocating colossal urban areas on the verge of collapse everything must have its procedure each person reduced to a figure each feeling adjusted to its moment each activity must be programmed be happier more efficient more productive the chill of knowing that it is true,5.00,505
let me start off first by saying that this is probably my favorite album of all time none in my collection top this one the first song is already genious it is about the fear of car wrecks and to think it is about the happiest song on the whole album i knew from the moment i first heard it that this was something special it then follows up with paranoid android which is one of my favorite tracks on the album i love how it starts off rather quiet then it ends loud the following song reminds me of pink floyd in ways thinking how spaced out and trippy it is exit music for a film is another favorite of mine i like how it builds later in the song it reminds me of the tragic scenes in movies where someone dies let down is another great song then karma police kicks in which is one argubly the best track on the album the album is a simple masterpiece and just when i thought it could not get any better i heard no suprises which is a peaceful song yet it sounds rather depressing another masterpiece this is without a doubt one of the best albums ever if you do not own it rush out and buy it,5.00,1096
if your going to buy a radiohead cd this is the one you get subdued in the music more guitar work here than any other album,5.00,123
perfect albums do not exist but this is one of the nearest to reach perfection,5.00,78
i got this album out of pure curiosity after i read an article on spin magazine saying that this was considered the best album of the last 25 yearsuntil that moment the only things i knew of radiohead were creepand kid aand nothing elseand then ok computer starts playing and from that moment i had found a really great band to listen toit is hard to explain how it soundsmaybe someone has already defined it better maybe even perfectlyi just like to think of the sound of ok computer has the sound of great music this opened my eyes to a new world of musicand i have to say thanks for that,5.00,590
i actually learned about radiohead through kid a and i found it acceptable with some great songs and some very dull songs imagine my surprise when i heard that radiohead had albums that were actually genius original and downright classic so i went to sounds our local and great musicstore at about 1400 took the album to sample it what happened then is blank i do not know exactly accept for that it was ecstatic but about 1430 when i woke up from my apparent trance because of some mechanical voice what turned out to be fitter happier i decided that this was a fantastic album the good things i heard were actually true little did i know that fitter happier was a turning point and not for the better but still it was not a mistake to buy the album the first half of the album makes it more then alright and the great songs became even greater over time and obviously the songs i did not like became slightly better too favorite track i know very clich but it is paranoid android,4.00,981
i have listened to this about half a dozen times so far good but still waiting for the magic to kick in maybe another few dozen listens i will review my rating then,3.50,164
this was the first radiohead album i have bought and truthfully i was expecting something different but instead i got something really different after one listen all the way through it i did not know what to think about this album i had heard a lot about this from other sources and friends and decided to check it out honestly i think it is slightly overrated maybe even out of its element being released in the late 90s i would recommend listening to some of the songs off this album before you buy just to make sure you will like it when you hand over the cash,3.00,563
back when i was a young whippersnapper i thought if music was on a major label and used nonpower chords then it was pretentious and worthless then i got ok computer basically because everyone was raving about it i loved it immediately this opened the doors of music for me and got me into pop music in turn exposing me to older music to which i was basically oblivious like bob dylan and iggy pop i have never heard a perfect album but this one is close a pessimistic look into the near future in musical form a cold jagged stairclimb to an unknown place i always took it that kid a was kind of a sequel to ok computer and starts at the mysterious setting of the tourist actually one of my few complaints is how the album ends i would have preferred a conclusive finishing track if they stuck everything in it is right place on the end then the albumd be pretty much untouchable i think it would be a stretch to call music this captivating pretentious and i recommend this as a great starter for anyone who wants to become more involved with music,4.50,1047
very nice album with some classic material radiohead at its best emotional musically to the dot and compositionwise excellent much better than the rather ordinary the bends which does not give that bit extra that a classic album needs except for some brilliant songs like street spirit this album keeps the listener interested and satisfied and by that standard is surely the dark side of the moon of the 90s,4.00,408
ok computernow here is a classic album this is the album that really made radiohead superstars and for good reason i slightly prefer the bends to this one but i still give it a perfect five stars ok computer certainly takes some getting used to but it is really worth it my top 3 songs on this album are paranoid android airbag no surprises but it is hard picking only 3 songs off a record where nearly everything is perfect overall my 2nd favorite radiohead album and a mustown for any fan of radiohead or rock in general 1010,5.00,527
ahhreviewing ok computer odds are you have heard this album before especially if you are here if you have not you should give this at least 3 listens please word of warning it is not like anything else from the 90s it is not straight forward and it is its own genre of rock if you find out you like this you truly have great taste in music the album for me starts at paranoid android i have never been too big on airbag as it does not do the album justice airbags a great song but you will soon see that it will not compare to the unearthly sounds you will hear in the tracks to come paranoid android is complex original crisp nostalgic etc it is really tough to get a full grasp on everything this song is and describing it to someone who is never heard it is close to impossible if you have not though i would say it is like watching a sunset in the fall somewhere in new england when the leaves have all changed color probably late october then something hits you like a baseball or a rock and you go unconscious you have a strange dream while you are out but then you realize you are dreaming and you scramble to try to gain consciousness yeah that is it  subterranean homesick alien is great but not nearly on the same level as paranoid android i feel bad for it because it has to follow the best song of its decade yet it is still unique and carefree though not as intense as paranoid android was this is probably the best song to get high to on the entire album due to it is calming happy feel exit music for a film rounds out the big 3 tracks on ok computer it is like subterranean homesick alien but with more earthly sounds and a darker feel probably the most depressing song on the album yet still one of the most beautiful the next 6 tracks can not compare to beginning of the cd but among them the ones that stand out the most are karma police and no surprises fitter happier is a very cool song at first because of the lyrics and the overall layout of the song but it is probably the only song on the track the wears on me after all these years of listening luckily it is a very short track the shortest on the album lucky and the tourist seem more lowkey and have very similar songs it is almost a transition into the less experimental style you will hear on kid a,4.50,2279
ok computer is often referred to as one of the if not the best album of the 90s still makes top ten lists all over the damn place and still sells like hotcakes the funny part is it is not overrated at all it is one of the best albums i have heard it deserves to be recognized for what it is of course anyone expecting commercialized altpop should stay away from this thing it is weird some of it is depressing but weird and depressing in a strikingly original even brilliant kind of way fave tracks the whole damn thing is great but airbag lucky and karma police,5.00,562
very much overrated but not a bad album let us see songs i liked paranoid android is undoubtedly the best song on the album and an extremely fun song to play on guitar remmember the video that was a fucked up one they should do more animated videos because yorkes chameleon eyes freak me out it is like he can look in 2 places at once other good songs include karma police because it sounds like sexy sadie no surprises which is nice and simple sounding and finally lucky which is probably the second best song on the album songs i am indifferent to airbag is alright although for some reason it reminds me of a u2 song which is not good because u2 sucks subterranean homesick alien is a poor followup to paranoid android let down is a let down fitter happier is only a few levels above the beatles no9 which means its barely tolerable electioneering is actually an alright song but not as good as the ones in the like section if it were not for the ending then the tourist would be in the section below songs that i hated exit musiccrap climbing up the walls is also a shitfest very much like old floyd trying to creep you out but just sucking really bad so all in all most of the songs are okay this album is not all its cracked up to be and from what i hear the bends has a more rounded selection of good songs a good one but not the best,3.50,1341
no matter how much i listen to it i never get to the bottom of it the deeper i go the more nuances i find absorbing and obsessive top record of the 90s it was a turning point for much of the music scene this is the album that singlehandedly destroyed all the quintessential brit pop bands blur suede oasis the verve the prevailing trend at the time none of those bands was able to assimilate the new path opened by ok computer and they saw how that band that they had eclipsed 3 years ago overtook them with an album that was far from everything done in the 90s up to that moment radioheads triumph does not lie in the success and recognition of this album what i value is that they achieved it by being faithful to their principles without letting themselves be influenced by fashion had they failed they would have died with their boots on,5.00,841
fucking great album i am going to this is what anathema started sound more like on a fine day to exit,4.50,101
to start this review i would like to say how nice it is that stephen hawking would make a guest appearance on this album how nice although fitter happier is not a very good song it is nice hearing the voice of a genius so i did not like this as much as many people do i do not like some of the songs my favorite would be karma police which sounds alot like sexy sadie by the beatles my second favorite paranoid android it is just a little too bland to be my favorite and a bit too long so this album is very good i just do not like it there is a difference so i would not hesitate to buy this album it may be your favorite it just is not for me it is not like i hate this album it is that i do not find interest in it so there,5.00,726
masterpiece is a bit strong  thom yorkes vocals are quite far from perfect  but this album is outstanding if you like it check out the bends as well it is about as excellent as this one,4.50,185
despite this album regularly coming top in various british music press best album in the world lists it is brilliant however not only is it not the best album in the world it is not the best album by radiohead it is the second best album by radiohead the best radiohead album is without a shadow of a doubt the bends this album is more the wall than the dark side of the moon of the 1990s powerful disorientating and claustrophobic this is the sound of thom york singing as the wall closes around,5.00,496
this is a perfect album just like the cover art of abbey road any modification would destroy it my suspicion is upheld by for example the transition from the tension present in exit music for a film to the tranquility of let down and many other gigantic moments i am yet to discover because every listen is a surprise,4.00,317
the ultimate statement on a modernized life,5.00,43
you know what i am reading a lot of reviews about people saying this album is overrated okay it is probably not the best album of all times like the q magazine likes to blabber about one should never trust the british press they keep foreseeing the new nirvana since kurt cobain died every single day  but i think that is personal to me it is the best album ever since it is a perfect record everythings there great melodies deep lyrics amazing guitar work original arrangements shinny production everything it shows radiohead in it is best form even if ok computer almost killed the band and it is an album completely filled with emotion i shiver everytime i listen to let down or subterranean homesick alien i feel like screaming together with thom yorke on climbing up the walls and holding my breath in no surprises it is such an epic that can be interpreted as a concept album with fitter happier dividing two sides of one masterpiece the a side being thom yorke showing how our world is becoming and the intense angst he feels with it the b side is the screaming of the ending the way that even if we try something we will end up getting nowhere not being able to do a single thing masterpieces have multiple interpretations ok computer is one of those it can even be interpreted as a bunch of good songs put together with no context between them or even as a loosely concept album with thom yorke internalizing political affairs and showing them in a completely personal way wich is what i believe and what i realize to be a genius work thom yorke itself hates ok computer he once said ok computer is no longer a radiohead album but instead an album made by the people who love it only masterpieces have that power ok computer has,5.00,1737
ok computer is an absolute masterpiece radiohead had established themselves as one of the worlds best bands with the 1995 release the bends but it was ok computer that showcased an amazing series of musically elaborate and groundbreaking tracks the epic threepart paranoid android effortlessly shifts in tempo and emotion while subterranean homesick alien exhibits a beautiful mellow guitar hook that builds to an explosive climactic chorus the atmospheric brilliance continues with the wrenching exit music the strange and comedic but infectiously catchy karma police and the breathtaking and sweeping lucky ok computer also contained the 1990s most culturally significant lyrical themes especially in the bizarre gripping fitter happier simply put this album focuses on the growing presence of technology ie the computer in society and its growing control of the masses still regardless of theme ok computer is a masterful set of adventurous musical arrangements and superb melodies and is most definitely the best record of its time,5.00,1035
when this album first came out i really enjoyed the music but the singers voice totally turned me off i just could not listen to it and i always found it a shame because the music was incredible now almost ten years later i gave it another try and the first retry i thought it was tolerable then a second spin totally hooked me and now i would not change the voice for anything the pure genius behind ok computer would simply be lost,5.00,433
ok computer is an album with an incredible reputation one i feel it almost lives up to radiohead are masters of filling out songs with little nuances that keep the music fresh after repeated listening the music is fairly dense there is a lot going on here and a true appreciation of the album only comes through repeated listenings basically with this album radiohead branched away from the alternative guitar rock sound of the bends traces of that sound are still here but are filled out by other elements  new sound combinations and a much wider instrumentation the band were much more innovative and creative with this album but did not sacrifice the great melodies that made the bends so great the lush production values also make the album and absolute pleasure to listen to it really is a treat on the ears thom yorkes smooth distinctive voice is beautiful to listen to and fits into radioheads sound like a glove the instrumentation is also very creative with some great innovative guitar playing and awesome effects that add to the songs the songs themselves are all beautiful individual and powerful pieces of music there is a sense of sadness about the record which varies from the detached melancholy of karma police to the full on depressive suicide that is exit music with the exception of the rocking electioneering the album is quite slow and reflective resulting in a great flowing listening experience the only thing that may put people off is fitter happier a robotic spoken word piece with some background effects it fits into the album well in my opinion and i do not mind listening to it along with the rest of the music paranoid android may be the most innovative thing here it is a multi part epic comparable to stuff like bohemian rhapsody and really is something i have not even mentioned half of the songs and the great things they do really the album is a classic and will be remembered by future generations when a band changes their sound into something more arty often things like melody and good song structure are comprimised with ok computer radiohead made the transition to a different sound perfectly which resulted in one of the best albums of the 90s,5.00,2187
i have mixed feelings of radiohead in general but nevertheless ok computer is very good what i love most of this album is their ability to perform subtle transitions with such complexity the songs are performed with layers upon layers of texture that are so well composed it makes me think i need to have a degree in music theory to fully appreciate their music technically there are periods when the album reaches a pinnacle with letdown and lucky which are probably some of their best songs yes their music is depressing and emotionally wearing usually not my style but some people take their music a little too seriously and find it a reflection of some of their tragic lives  please they have created such an obsessed fan base of intellectual poseurs radiohead can be pretentious which i have no problem with but some radiohead fans act pompous as a result of liking them its attractive to the modern day college minds that like to discuss the watered down problems of decaying human society,5.00,995
i would not say this is one of the best albums ever recorded in fact i got angry when i listened to it for the first time it did not lived to my expectations but these guys know their craft the arrangements are very imaginative although sometimes they get predictable and the music dwells on commonplace melodies for example in karma police which is very beatle ok computer has one master piece paranoid android,4.00,411
no doubt that ok computer was one the most important albums of the past decade a breakthrough in the alternative scene of the late 90s it carried a totally new sound and became the inspiration for many posterior bands above all revitalized the tired brit pop and showed another way darker more introvert and intricate it is by far radioheads best shot as a whole it has a specific concept and conveys a certain message the problem for me is that there is no a creep song in that album i mean that i have got enough of experimentations and impressive tricks what i miss is a song that can touch me and stick in my head for more than 10 years the one that comes close to it is no surprises all the others are admirable efforts rather superficial though,3.50,750
i have just finished listening to ok computer for the nth time and while this exceptional album is fresh in my memory i guess i should talk about it i am sure many other people can and have done a much better review of this album but i would just like to say this give it a try i think the album needs at least 3 listens before you realise how good it is and after that you are in for a treat i guess the reason this album remains so playable time after time is because of the amount of thought behind it it is beautifully crafted each song containing many layers of sound that mean whenever you listen there is something new to discover i will not go into the album track by track but i would say that i think the album has a very good mixture of songs that you almost instantly like in my case airbag let down karma police and i guess no surprises to those that take a while to grow on you i used to really dislike exit music but now it is one of my favourites in the album and the touristis such a beautiful way to end an album perhaps even better than street spirit perhaps an album hyped up so much like ok computer will never really be exceptional enough to justify the exaggerations of fans but for me it is an album to treasure,5.00,1235
just because it is overrated does not mean it is no good quite enjoyable and inventive if you can get past the amazing amount of hype that has come its way and also overcome thom yorkes at times almost unbearable selfpitying whine but i rather like it  somehow though they are almost always better live when they just let go and get down and what have you well that was then and this is now,4.00,390
i like the experimenty feel to the albumsome great great songs but maybe a bit difficult for me to listen to all the way through,4.00,128
do not listen to this on a sunny cheerful day listen to it when you are angry and sad about school work and basically about how humans are made to live it can save your life fitter happier is the best track on the album people say it is a selfindulgent jerkoff but that is only because they do not get it it is very powerful,5.00,324
radiohead  not as good as the talking heads song of the same name just kidding i do not even own true stories and i probably never will what with that uglyass cover and all i actually enjoy the music of radiohead a good deal and its quite understandable that they have become one of the most successful groups of the past decade  they are smart enough to appeal to intellectual types while not being overly weird for the radio do me a favour though and chuck that bends album in the bin though and by bin i mean multi disc cd changer obviously the band realised that the bends was quite the generic 90s altrock album because this album is hardly conventional at all its got flow its got a concept the dehumanisation and resulting apathy and paranoia caused by the rise and rise of technology in the late 20th century and its filled with all sorts of interesting sounds and effects much like mid 70s pink floyd for those with fingers i count electronic bleepy noises bells triangles pianos macintosh voice boxes and truckloads of guitar effects and overdubs  sound cool however those of us who have listened to a sound effects cd yes they exist know that interesting noises do not always translate into good music luckily these aforementioned effects are often incorporated in interesting creative ways that complement and enhance the songs instead of overwhelming them for example the sleigh bells and distorted drums on airbag the heartbreaking xylophoneguitar duet and backing choir of black gospel thom yorkes on no surprises the utterly beautacious electronic bleeping and tambourine drum part  in let down and the outer space guitarplay in subterranean homesick alien these are all great songs well written and well arranged but some of these songs just do not cut the mustard does anyone know the origin of this expression has anyone anywhere ever cut mustard i looked it up and noone knows when compared to what radiohead are obviously capable of i do not like to name names but the misleadingly titled exit music for a film is a terribly stultifying ballad fitter happier is a dramatic monologue performed by a steven hawking soundalike climbing up the walls is spooky but unmemorable and paranoid android is much more interesting than entertaining that is four songs songs that are not exactly bad songs per se just songs that i personally never ever get the urge to listen to for whatever reason do not get me started on that hidden track either ok computer is a timeless record  sure the guitars a bit mid 90s in places but people in 20 years time will be listening to this and smiling the smiles of ears well satisfied the way it captures the technophobia and insecurity of the late 90s and indeed the new millennium is an impressive achievement and not something to be sneezed at i just do not think that this record is worthy of all the hype and acclaim that has been retroactively placed on it that cowbell in electioneering is pretty cool though perhaps that is why this album is so highly rated,0.50,3011
great album the beat of the last 10 years if you take out flitter happy and exit music the album is perfect and i would have gave it 5 stars best songs paronoid andoriod karma police let down,4.00,191
while more predictable than their later work it nevertheless one of the most emotionally intense albums i have heard sort of takes me back to my teenage years not a good thing but intense,5.00,187
it is not better than in the aeroplane over the sea but it will do,5.00,66
took a while to get into but i now consider this album a classic best songs include karma police and paranoid android,4.50,117
ok computer is only an ok listen regardless of the sonic imagination trendsetting and endless acclaim there is still no escaping thom sounding insufferably whiny,2.50,161
regardless of the fact that a generation will come to hate it with all its soul it is an incredible album in every way the best album of all time well look probably,5.00,164
this album not only lives up to its incredible hype it actually surpasses it in my opinion ok computer is a flawless record i am a huge radiohead fan and this album is a big reason why the music is very powerful and it always draws my attention the balance of light and heavy guitars with electricprog sounds really makes it unique and revolutionary the songs are stellar the big tracks paranoid android and karma police are both incredible my personal favorites are exit music climbing the walls and no surprises the vocals thom yorke delivers are amazing throughout the entire album he is a truly talented singer he shines in every setting all in all this album is 5 stars no question there is no reason why you should not atleast give this a listen let the genius sink in before you judge it,5.00,794
there is a solid argument to be made that this is the greatest album of all time most great albums eg revolver sgt pepper nevermind blonde on blonde loveless pet sounds ziggy stardust are great because were a departure from everything that came before and they changed the course of music ok computer did not however change the course of music it is unassailable a peak that not even radiohead themselves can presume to attempt again it would have been equally or more astonishing in any year before or since its release try saying that about any other album,5.00,558
back when i was only a young lad well say five years ago i heard all about this radiohead band and how ok computer is truly one of the great albums of our time and i never disagreed as i had never heard anything from radiohead so last year i decided it was time to give them a listen as by the law of averages i like muse placebo the cure they should be my sort of band ok computer was the second radiohead album i bought after amnesiac like many other people i found that i did not quite see how it could be rated so highly i thought it was good but not one of the best ever good so i continued to listen to it and it grew on me of course in a way some songs became a sort of soundtrack to my life i lived by them listened to them over and over again and they continued to grow on me so i decided to dig deeper and analyse the concept of ok computer and what i found made the album grow on me further the dehumanization and constraints of society and progress you listen to the lyrics listen to the sounds which they have placed beneath it all listen to everything that you can possibly hear and then do it all again and then the overwhelming pain sets in what has happened to our world where we live our lives how we are told by the powers that be fitter happier sums it up best i suppose sure it can be discarded as a meaningless piece of filler but it is actually anything but that two minutes of computerized vocals and melodramatic piano is ok computer it is the core of the album that is why it separates the first half from the second half so do not just skip it every time listen and think now getting past that this album is a true masterpiece of intelligence and talent it is comfortable yet frantic peaceful yet conflicted the simplicity of songs such as let down and no surprises is so confronting that it hurts it lowers your spirits and makes your heart ache while still making you feel so happy and grateful that you could hear a piece of music that can make you feel that way whether another band will be able to compete with this album in this genre ever again is unlikely it seems that even radiohead will not be able to this album is the apex of the britrock genre listen to it and appreciate the fact that you have been blessed with the ability to listen to it best three tracks from ok computerif you can name three standouts 1 let down 2 climbing up the walls 3 paranoid android,5.00,2401
canciones favoritas paranoid android karma police exit music for a film,5.00,71
i give it 4 stars for the reason of paranoid android what a great song the rest is ok but i tend to prefer amnesiac,4.00,115
it is absolutely tough for me to still imagine how 7600 random people who rated this album give an average of 441 rating i mean its almost impossible impossible in the sense that this album has such musical and emotional depth that i can hardly convince myself that all these people would connect to this album so easily i mean i would understand if 80 of the people would say that they love the beatles and their hum able songs but this one is hardly anywhere close to that it actually took me a long time to get used to this album and then love it and then feel the depth that it carries i bought this one at the time when i was going through a very depressing time and probably that is the only time when anyone could possibly likelove this album i would even go on to say that somehow in a strange way kid a is much more catchier than this album i repeat catchy maybe not an easier listen but that album stick in your head more than this one for me this album and the pink floyds the division bell opened the gates to a whole new world how music draws new emotions there are couple of really intellectual songs like karma police and climbing up the walls mixed with really really emotional songs like exit music and lucky and sad song like no surprises this is a milestone when it comes to my passion in music after listening to this album for straight 6 months and nothing else i remember that everything that i heard on tv and radio would sound pale even sour still hard for me to imagine that radiohead is selling so many cds and loved by so many makes me doubt if those fans are actually fans or just posers ,5.00,1616
for the 558the time this is a flawless piece of work that cements radiohead at the forefront of not only the british alt rock scene but of the rock scene in general wonderful layered tracks that grow and grow on you as i say a great album that is even forgivven for fitter happier which frankly i just do not get with the likes of no surprises and my personal highlight of the album paranoid android which in my view is highly underrated you are not a lover of music until you appreciate this album this review is nothing you have not heard before but just thort i should reinforce the fact you run out of superlatives for this album and get bored,5.00,647
favourite tracks let down favourite ever song by anybody no surprises lucky the b sides disc is also brilliant showing that they had quality by the megatonne,5.00,157
it is no secret that this is one if the best of the best albums of all time just check the top 1000 albums of all time on this very website 7 i have listened to this album close to every day for the last two years and i still marvel at it is genius it is a perfect blend of every radiohead album halfway in between the bends and some songs climbing up the walls stray near the kid a era it is brilliant album and everyone should get acquainted with it best songs all of them but paranoid android lucky exit music and the tourist are my favourites,5.00,546
unlike many british albums from the ninteties ok computer has aged like fine wine today the themes of paranoia expressed on this masterpiece are more striking than ever radiohead supports their concept with their most progressive musical effort to this point in their career the songs are instantly memorable  moments such as the opening riff to airbag the cathartic climax of exit music for a film the anguished screaming in climbing up the walls and the epic closer the tourist grab hold from the first spin and do not let go no album has achieved such passion focus intelligence and complexity all in one package as well as this one has,5.00,639
so much has been said already personally i like the bends slightly better but it does not prevent ok computer from being a classic album try to sing no surprises exit music for a film or lucky without crying at the end every track on this album has at one point been my favorite thom yorke takes you to a journey into his head it is a sad place but not one you want to leave,5.00,374
first heard this cd in march of 2005 i was curious about the disc notes and lyrics and i discovered this website httpwwwateasewebcom everything that i wanted and more is this website i have rated all of rh a 4 with the exception of pablo honey r2 and hail to the thief r5,4.00,271
their best album tragical magical sad do not listen to it when you are depresed and remember that you will not like radiohead when you have only listened to them once or twice,5.00,175
ok computer is considered by most to be radioheads best album and with good reason it is an album with classic songs from the 90s you can listen to it from start to finish and you will not get bored many thought that the bends could already have a masterpiece but the best was yet to come it is that kind of music that you can listen to and it really impresses you radiohead was unfairly wedged into britpop but in reality their music is unique this is an album that may not be very easy to digest at first but i think that by the third listen you will end up loving it there are many essential tracks my favorites are paranoid android subterranean homesick alien and exit music for a film,5.00,689
reviews are irrelevant what really matters sic  mattered is ignored in time in exchange for slick language ego and personal bias okcomputer  headphones  sonic bliss,5.00,164
one of my college roommates used to make fun of another roommate for buying radioheads first album pablo honey on the strength of the single creep the dismissive derider thought that radiohead was clearly a one hit wonder on the tail end of the grunge phenomenon and would never be heard from again although i liked creep well enough i never bothered to listen to the album nor did i muster a counterargument for all that i could tell he was right a little while later i heard a different acquaintances copy of their second album the bends and was shocked by how good it was but i was too proud to go out and buy my own copy of it because i did not respect this dudes taste in music enough to allow myself to be so directly influenced by him so i continued to resist becoming a radiohead fan until i heard the undeniably great karma police and paranoid android and just had to finally purchase this wonderful cd i still remember where and when i made that purchase and recall that day whenever i pass by the store a big box next to an interstate where i pulled over on a whim on road trips in short ok computer is absolutely deserving of its reputation as the dark side of the moon of the 90s more specifically we get a great intro a la speak to mebreatheon the run in airbag that establishes some themes while not blowing us away but building up the anticipation with chord progressions and arrangements bringing unresolved tension then on to the main feast on dark side we got the soaring epic time and here we get something arguably even better paranoid android is one of the greatest prog rock tracks ever produced whether radiohead actually likes prog or not i love the loose feel of the acoustic guitars throughout the early part of the song and colin greenwoods playful groove on the bass and as usual thom sings the hell out of this one and the lyrics kicking screaming gucci little piggie hell yes but this all still just build up for the guitar riffagecarnage to follow jonny greenwoods lovetone meatball effect on the guitar solo absolutely kills with gutpunches from time and paranoid android coming so soon after the albums introductions do both of these albums peak too early a case could be made for that but they both attain great heights later too and function beautifully as cohesive listening experiences so i tend to think that the albums probably flowed best with these tracks in their respective places and flow is a key similarity here in that both albums are better than the sum of their parts by virtue of the fact that they are both such superb bodies of work in their coherence and listenability on the whole even when they are bringing on some serious depression after the respective epics the albums continue to flow in similar directions for now as we get a bit of a break in the action on both albums and mellow out a bit with the breathe reprise at the end of time and the great gig in the sky on dark side and subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film and let down on ok computer it is interesting how both great gig and exit music develop dazzle and dissolve in similar fashion both moving the listener in similar fashion due to the expert songcraft employed by these two amazing bands next we get the albums big hits in money and karma police beyond that distinction there is really not much of an honest comparison to be made between these tracks but we continue to see how similarly the albums flow anyway and there is still plenty left to enjoy on both of these albums as we get moving slow songs about forms of isolation in no surprises and us and them the albums close in distinctly different fashions much of this owing to the fact that dark side of the moon is a concept album with musical themes that are reintroduced rehashed and resolved whereas ok computer continues to explore new musical directions this aspect of the comparison also feeds into the whole dark side of the moon of the 90s bit in that concept albums while they are still being made will probably forever be associated with the 1970s the decade in which dark side of the moon was released if ok computer had been a concept album then the comparison probably would not have worked as well in terms of either its identity as a strong product of its times or of the widespread acceptance that it attained which are absolutely essential for this comparison it is notable that ok computer was obtained and enjoyed by such a wide swathe of rock fandom even as represented by my own group of friends who have fairly divergent musical tastes because that is the kind of popularity that made dark side of the moon the cultural touchstone of its day too just about everybody of certain ages who was into rock music at the time of these releases knows these albums and can be expected to be conversant on the topic even if they do not like them i once dated an older woman who was convinced that i was someone else who was posting online merely because the other guy and i shared a mutual love of both radiohead and neil young she failed to understand how thoroughly unremarkable that is name any major rock act plus pink floyd or radiohead and fans who share a love for both of them are going to be common some may view it as a disservice to compare the albums in such direct fashion especially since despite the numerous comparisons there is zero evidence that radiohead was consciously aping or performing any sort of homage to pink floyd with this album so let me be perfectly clear that i only intend to present this comparison on the basis of commonalities that both of these great albums happen to share and which have resulted in a frequently made observation that proves true under scrutiny radiohead definitely was not seeking to rehash any sort of 70s prog jonny greenwood reportedly does not even like dark side of the moon relatively speaking radiohead who had started off sounded like a mishmash of u2 in a grunge direction with greater chops in evidence than either of those institutions was bringing something just as new and excellent if not even greater to the table as pink floyd had within the natural progression and context of their own musical abilities and influences so now that we have that comparison out of the way so what an album does not attain greatness in a vacuum so it is worth examining how it changed the musical landscape especially in the case of this particular album the albums title represents an obvious concession to technology but this is still in large part a guitar album especially in comparison to the direction taken by the band later on kid a and amnesiac still much was made of that title at the time and techno although it never really caught on in the states like the media claimed that it would seemed poised to dominate with the guitar reportedly on the verge of extinction although that did not happen there definitely was a rash of successful radiohead clones popping up like doves travis and coldplay so in that respect the album has continued to influence the charts even though it never helped to usher in any sort of technoage at all however although guitar driven rock directly influenced by this album remains with us we may never see the likes of an album like ok computer and its widespread acceptance throughout rock fandom and influence on fellow musicians again with the popularity of music downloading having hurt physical rock album sales it is evident that the dynamics of music sales have shifted appreciably and more rock fans are taking the opportunity to less expensively explore their own preferred niches making it far less likely that rock fans will come together over and fully absorb an album in such a fashion ever again a few years after its release some alltimegreatestalbum lists placed ok computer squarely at the top and although that has grown rarer i still would not have a problem with it,5.00,7887
ok computer radiohead took their successful rock sound of the bends and experimented with it now to a lot of people the word experimentation can be pretty scary it means something new something different and oh my is that scary however experimentation sometimes fails and sometimes it fails miserably and unfortunately that is the case we have here a reviewer for my school paper said this about this album a technological bore not at all ok computer if i may borrow that term i believe it characterizes this album perfectly a technological bore radiohead took their rather unique style of british rock and layered it with so called soundscapes these soundscapes range from unnecessary to annoying to boring with nothing good along at times they are just used to heavily and interfere with the good playing going on beneath them at other times when they are being used to establish a mood they bore the listener and thom yorke could have done himself well to give his old pink floyd and tangerine dream albums a spin before he created this to see how this technique is actually used atmosphere is a delicate thing like baking a souffl and radiohead yelped while this was in the oven i find the use of many of these soundscapes to be completely unnecessary their melodic guitar work along with thom yorkes distinctive vocals give the music a dreamy nature alone and the soundscapes just come off as excess though in some songs they hit it just right and it comes off pleasant karma police and climbing up the walls but by no means essential to the song thom yorke voice is a bit well it is certainly distinct let us say that it will annoy you at first then it will grow on you heck you might even start to like it but it will never become one of those voices you love you certainly do not want to hear anything a cappella from this man the alum has some very strong moments even after its clunky start with airbag paranoid android starts out with a very brooding atmosphere until it eventually explodes into a very enjoyable angsty rocker exit music and let down are two emotional pieces that listeners on antidepressants should avoid but the rest of the album comes off unmemorableno surprises or unlistenabletourist a prime example of an artist losing its footing and being swept away by experimentation i feel too many people are hyped into giving this album a five star rating it certainly has its flaws but it also has its moments radiohead did better with the bends and its probably best for everyone to start and stay there,3.50,2529
the album that made me their real fan ok computer earned them even the critics applauses,5.00,88
i really got nothing more to add to the conversation around this album other than that it is harder to think of an album that more succinctly sums up this certain mindset of a time period than this one i am not talking pro or protest songs about a time but music that hits the pressure of living through it the mindset that comes from it squashed like bugs not a question of if but when for how long and how bad,4.50,411
the greatest album ever although i would say the same thing for amnesiac too airbag 8510 a great intro to the best album ever get you prepared for paranoid android paranoid android 1010 a symbol of a classic radiohead song this song is usually considered as the best song of radiohead although for me is one of the best the most popular song of radiohead consists of three independent songs joint together delicately the beginning part is an awesome classic rock song and then it becomes a hardcore rock following by one of the best melody drum ever made and at the end hardcore again the song was initiated when thom was in a messy bar in la surrounded by annoying people as you can also guess from its video clip although the character in the video clip is robin made by a swedish director magnus carlsson kicking and squealing gucci little piggy refers to a fat woman getting on thoms nerve in that bar subterranean homesick alien 8510 a good song i cannot tell anymore about this one usually the there are a couple of songs in radiohead albums at the beginning that are preparing you for more excitement i think this song is one of them exit music for a film 1010 a wonderful drum song originally written for romeo and juliet movie the lyrics penetrates under your skin there are some parts in the song that you really want to scream and cry specially when the song gets more exciting you can laugh a spineless laugh  and then my favorite part of the songs comes up we hope your rules and wisdom choke you  overall i think it is the best drum song of radiohead played by guitar let down 1010 hysterical and useless simply the best you have to listen to this song more and more and you love it more and more just go to the busy part of the town and walk around look at the people around you and listen to this song one of the good things i love about this song is that it gets better and better as it goes my favorite part is the last section of it you know you know where you are with you know where you are with floor collapses floating bouncing back and one day i am going to grow wings a chemical reaction hysterical and useless karma police 1010 this is what you get when you mess with us this song is probably the most famous song of radiohead after creep i have not seen anyone listen to this song for the first time and do not agree that it is a wonderful song so it is the best song if you want to introduce radiohead to the beginners however when you get involved in radiohead more you do not listen to it much often the same thing about creep too because they are different from other radiohead songs they are wonderful rock songs however different from other songs they are the best for the follower groups of radiohead coldplay travis muse kean  to have an idea how to write a song but they can never get close to it as chris martin coldplay singer says about the new era of brit rock i think if you imagine radiohead going through a jungle clearing a path then we are the ones who are probably just criminally paving it i always see radiohead as the braver people fitter happier 8510 this is probably the weirdest song in ok computer although there is some music in the background the song is mostly influenced by the lyrics all the shit that we have to care everyday we hear it in tv radio reading in magazines newspapers another interesting thing about this song is that in the whole song you think you have to do what the computer like preacher is telling you but at the end the sentence comes like a pig in a cage on antibiotics electioneering 810 it is a good hard rock song but i am not a huge fan of it climbing up the walls 9510 this song has gained lots of attractions among radiohead fans it is different from other songs of the album but i would say electioneering is a good intro to this song the rhythm and the lyrics of the main part usually remain in your mind for a while if you listen to this song for a few times no surprises 910 i really feel i am the guy thom is talking about a heart that is full up like a landfill a job that slowly kills you bruisers that will not hill the lyrics in this song is extremely depressing however the music itself is not that depressing compare to other songs like tourist exit music and lucky in this album the instrument that is used in this song is glockenspiel one of the songs that is good to present to rookie radiohead listeners lucky 9510 this is a great drum song composed just in a couple of days for the album war child this album was created by various artists for the children of war in bosnia tourist 9510 this song is mostly composed by johny it was inspired when the group was in paris and they saw tourists specially americans passing by at thousand feet per second without noticing the marvelous beauty of paris and it made johnny crazy hey man slow down slow down idiot slow down slow down this is a perfect song for ending the best album in the history usually the last song of radiohead albums are different from the others and usually are welcomed by a widerang of music tastes street spirit was like this in the bends,5.00,5109
this is simply the best album i have ever heard i can not describe how much i love this album to say it changed my life would be a cheesy comment though a true one thank you radiohead,5.00,183
mmmmm overrated great album that is still in the rotation but not 3rd best ever as with most of their stuff  too selfindulgent yorke is a very important person in the music world  to himself  and this reflected in his increasingly fragmented writing,3.00,249
very fantastic musicianship for the first half of this album and good throughout i can definitely recommend this album for the music and instrumentation unfortunately when it comes to the lyrics the emperor has no clothes subterranean homesick alien has the best lyrics out of everything here the rest of the lyrics can be enjoyable to sing along with and if i still had time to smoke pot and hang around listening to albums all day long i am sure i could find some deeper meaning of the existential realities of the common pork rind contained within but i do not,3.00,563
i think in 2035 this album will be regarded as the beatles revolver is today a spectacular timeless piece of music and a perfect mirror or witness of its time what more can be asked from a pop album,5.00,198
so this has been one of those few chart things that has always bothered me i do not get how this is the 1 album on this site do i like ok computer yes do i think ok computer belongs in the top 100 sure top 10 maybe number 1 no definitely not my own history with ok computer i was a college radio dj in 1997 i was friends with the stations music director and i remember him mentioning to me in the spring of 97 that radiohead had a new album coming out soon that he heard great things about i still only knew radiohead as a onehit wonder and had heard very little about them since creep which i liked after returning to school and my beloved radio show the next fall i do not remember even seeing a new radiohead album on the rotation the real radio station in our area 97x later known as woxycom did not play ok computer i never heard anything about this album until 2000 or 2001 when it began to gain its legendary status my own rating of this record has gone up and down over the years i like it but it is not a record i ever reach for or get a strong desire to listen to i got more into radiohead after kid a came out and i went back and listened to ok computer i have since realized something about radiohead their albums sound really great the first time but they do not seem to age well while ok computer has never been a goto album for me i do find that this is the one radiohead album that does age well and i somewhat reluctantly admit that it is improving with age,4.00,1474
paranoid android is one of the most incredible songs ever released but this album is slightly overrated and hence should appear in any top ten album lists,4.50,154
quality stuff the purely rocky sound of the bends has been changed slightly and made a bit more experimental and a bit more electronic and that is not a bad thing at all it has a very unique sound which only radiohead seem to produce and exaggerate massively on albums such as amnesiac and has some truly classic tracks on it paranoid android karma police no surprises electioneering lucky if you consider yourself a music fan own this album,5.00,441
amazing incredible without any doubt one of the greatest albums of the 90s and in my opinion of the whole history of music,5.00,122
paranoid android owns your souls,5.00,32
strange that everything after karma police is just really bad those first six songs are 5star in my book i suppose if you like your psychedelia extremely light and your lyrics infused with just a tinge of sadness this record can do you no wrong,3.00,244
the bends might have been one of the nineties best guitar rock albums but taking into account the mediocrity of pablo honeyi radiohead in 1997 were only ever a band to watch however from the moment ok computer was put into cd players across the country it pushed radiohead into that spot where only few artists reach the albums opener is arguably the most powerful track on the album from the moment airbag starts you realise you are listening to something completely new and fantastic this follows with paranoid android which remains to this day one of radioheads most experimental and ambitious no pun intended tracks while subeterranean homesick alien is undoubtedly the albums low point it still contains some of the most interesting radiohead lyrics written this is answered with exit music for a film an incredibly dark account of the last scene to romeo and juliet and the albums high point the following let down is a feel good song which would have fitted on one of radioheads former albums and karma police is the most accessible and catchy songs on the album after fitter happier  a short poem said in a stephen hawking like voice we have a quick return to the rocky guitar sound of the earlier albums with electioneering this is then answered by climbing up the walls another dark track which sees thom yorke even scream towards the end of the track no surprises is disputedly radioheads greatest moment with its plinkyplonky guitar riff and glockenspeill its comments on nineties life as well as the mixture of light guitar riffs and dark lyrics sum up this album brilliantly lucky is another song that uses guitar spectacularly yet this time it is softer and more meaningful the final track the tourist contains some of the best lyrics on the album and is a chilling end to a chilling album this album is undoubtedly radioheads best and will probably never be bettered by the now heavily abstract band ok computer is simply fantastic its dark themes inlude comments on the premillenium world office jobs computers and mobile phones radioheads ok computer was predicted to be the last proper rock album ever as the world fast became engulfed by techno sounds and napster they were wrong but it remains radioheads last word in conventional rock and an album which is now widely considered to be the best ever,5.00,2320
well without a doubt you can see a big change compared to his predecessor albums a much looser and more innovative thom york takes over from the bends rocker jonny greenwood confirms in airbag the song with which he opens this exceptional album to be the perfect complement to yorke paranoid android is the early climax of the album and begins what would later become electronic indie from then on all that remains is to enjoy a series of wellstructured harmonies be careful do not expect to hear a rock album or anything similar to the bends because you will not find it this is a much cleaner and more refined work it is a complete album there is no waste making an analogy with pink floyd this album would be his dark side of the moon,4.50,737
even though i hardly listen to it anymore i still feel that this album deserves every praise as a masterpiece emotionally i am in a different place from where i was when i really got into this album that is why it seems i do not connect to the whiny thom yorke mood anymore but musically this still is a wonderful album which used to mean a lot to me,4.50,350
i just listened to okay computer again thinking i had missed something it still sucks dull dreary humorless pretentious,2.50,119
urban dystopia par excellencei this is rightly regarded as the best british album of the 90s it transcends the bands preceding albums and still makes something new and interesting of its obvious influences particularly pink floyd stands together fantastically as an album as it has a coherent sound which includes lots of great individual songs but these do not detract from from the overall intensity and consistency of the album lyrically and musically as good as music got in the 1990s listening to it occasionally now but the pain and glory still shines through,5.00,565
well this is an album with the right concept that is the absolute truth but to me it sounds like most other alt rock albums because of the vocals if the vocals were done by someone with a different voice or in a different style this could have been a masterpiece to some people this is the greatest thing in the world to me its just an album with an bad presentation but with a great concept,3.00,391
i cannot stand people who say it is not that good or that it is overrated almost every song on this album is a classic especially the first six unlike anything else ever it is underrated if anything,5.00,198
i am giving this release 5 stars because it deserves it every song works perfectly in the context of the album as a whole and when you take them seperately they are still great airbag is one of the most powerful opening songs ever and the trend continues throughout the entire album paranoid android with its classic guitar solos exit music with it is lyrics and of course the ending of the song and every single second of let down all help prove that this is one of the best cds of the 90s after fitter happier we get into electioneering a straight forward rock song but a great straight forward rock songs climbing up the walls which is a terrifying song especially in the dark is followed by no surprises which is a frighteningly depressing song lucky is once again another fine display of yorkes voice and the tourist is one of the most beautiful songs ever download picks the whole cd as a whole but if you only want a few songs get paranoid android let down tourist,0.50,971
great great cd always can come back to it and it never gets oldthere is not a bad track on the whole cdeven fitter happier adds some lever of creppieness that i love,5.00,165
i previously had a review that went on about how this album says a lot about britain in the nineties and how it is essential but i deleted that because i decided it was pointless not to mention poorly written i mean let us be honest  there is not much chance of me being able to change your mind about radiohead you either think they are a band who are capable of changing lives or you think they are a bunch of whiny students who should try getting a proper job there are a few in the middle ground but there is bound to be  over 2500 ratings  this is an all pervading album you have heard about it a million times already probably from many people more expressive than i could ever be anyway ignorantium said it all better in his review go read that sorry about breaking reviewing guidelines but it really is a good review,4.50,824
one of the best albums ever if i had the chance to give it a sixth star i would have done it in an era where everything is so already said and there is only bad stuff going on these guys said something different thank you guys thank you for making me believe in music and in its future again,5.00,291
count me as someone who does not get this the guitar playing is very nice drumming is good the singing is incredibly annoyingly inconsistent so i cannot enjoy this particularly for the same reason as jeff buckley the smiths oasis etc the lyrics are ok songs like karma police would sound a lot better if you handed them to michael stipe or roger waters or maybe even better brad from crash test dummies if you want a more mournful downbeat style at least most of it is not as annoying as airbag and climbing up the walls could do without some of the afternoon delight type sound effects on subterranean homesick alien as well scraping to get it to 35 for the instrumentation no surprises is the best track on here if i had a headache or close to this gets a 3 the other test of goodness being that there is zero desire to acquire any more radiohead after hearing this often can be the case for something so obviously mainstream and out there that i have never noticed before close to best album ever no way,3.00,1006
a mighty opressive treatise on western alienation ok computer did all right here reaching number 21 on the album charts and charting two decentsized modern rock hits i still hear karma police on the radio from time to time the playing is tight the pieces fit so well while the band does not sport fantastic guitarists they make the most of the ideas and pedals they brought paranoid android is a fine example save the unexplained shift to humanmoog lamentation at the 335 mark it is a clinic in merging several concepts into a unified theme and much as i hate to admit it the lp itself is much the same glistening yearning pieces like subterranean homesick alien let down and airbag the last too grand for the other tracks but a shocking good opener nonetheless coalesce with forlorn suburban headclutchers like exit music and no surprises the result is not something i think is particularly relevant or novel oh those machines and the ways they falsely divorce us from our fragility ourselves but if i do not sniff glue should i be talking about the ramones note though that karma policefitter happier is a onetwo selfpitying codsarcastic crapfest note it,3.50,1156
ok computer is radioheads third album and also possibly their most famous it serves as a transition between their earlier grunge and punk influenced albums pablo honey and the bends and their more avantgarde albums kid a and amnesiac as far as songs go it is second to none containing several of the bands most popular tracks it features paranoid android karma police and exit music for a film on many tracks radiohead combines conventional 5 piece rock music with electronic sounds and beats that provide a listening experience that is not soon to be forgotten notable tracks paranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police lucky buy or borrow buy,5.00,658
radioheads second best album the first one is certainly the bends karma police could easily be evaluated as one of the best songs ever made but the whole album is a bit overrated,4.00,178
beautiful haunting and mesmerizingbuy this album if you do not own it,5.00,69
deepr and more artsy than the first two albums drawing on influences from real life situations shakespeare and personal jokes within the band that become personal messages won album of the year in japan and in my opinion this one remains unmatched by any artist the style changes a bit from catchy rock to darker more meaningful music brilliant,4.50,344
one of the most innovative and ambitious albums of all time much more complex than the bends but not necessarily better like comparing pulp fiction with reservoir dogs one cannot but admire the scope of the album but some of the purity of the older album is lost on the way actually the only real drawback to this album is that it is too breathtaking for one to listen to it more than once at a time it exhausts your energies completely  which again is not necessarily a bad thing,5.00,480
simply one of the greatest albums of all timeby a group of incredible musiciansjonny greenwood is also the best guitarist in the world today i would write a full review outlining how it earns its reputation but it has all been said before,5.00,238
one of the few on repeat albums that i do not really tire of hearing,4.50,68
a great album sure but perhaps overated nowhere near as good as kid a,4.50,69
the bends is a great album and this weird point where brit pop and us alternative rock meet in seemingly perfect harmony i really think that had radiohead stuck to that formula nobody would have minded too much everyone or nearly everyone would have been perfectly happy with the bends ii and the bends would have just been regarded as their best album instead they made this record adding prog rock post rock and post punk though there was some of that earlier influences to their sound as well as a lyrical concept that perhaps feels even more significant and prescient than it did at the time it is a masterpiece  rarely do music and lyrics mesh so well rarely do the lyrics of a band feel like lasting insights  and one of the great records of the 1990s it outdoes the bends on every level one would have thought that an impossible feat and established radiohead as something much more than just a brit pop band unduly influenced by grunge it is not their best record in my mind which sounds insane given the praise i just gave it but it is very close and it is as essential as any 90s rock album,5.00,1100
being hailed as one of the best albums in 1990s ok computer is bound to get many reviews in which it is said to be overrated this is not one of them it might not be the best album ever and it is actually a kind of transition album between the guitarheavy radiohead and more electronic one but it is a very good album it makes the most of the unique haunting soundscape combined of electronic noises and both acoustic and distorted guitars ok computer begins with the atmospheric airbag one of the few positive songs on the album it is a close relative to planet telex from the bends then things are getting stranger and gloomier paranoid android is melancholic to the extreme with occasional guitardriven outbursts subterranean homesick alien is a solid alternative rock song that gets better after a few listens exit music is an evil slowly growing brooding song as it is said in the lyrics it gives such a chill the rest of the material is equally good with the exceptions of boring climbing up the walls and lucky a bittersweet ballad that somehow does not quite get off the ground the album ends brilliantly with the tourist an overlooked gem of a song,5.00,1156
radioheads triumphant farewell to somewhat conventional rock this album stands out as a modern rock classic,5.00,107
i have heard how great this album is and it did not dissapoint much better than kid a which is extremely boring after you listen to it once it show the more musical side in them not just a lot of random noises like kid a the guitar was gret in a lot of songs especially paranoid android my favorite song was electioneering,4.50,322
ah what can someone say about this album that has not been mentioned in the past 8 years of its existence it is simply a flawless album a modernday classic and an undying flame in a forest of darkness ok computer instills hope in having something come out in the mainstream that is extraordinary thrilling uncompromising and most of all artistic in its truest sense this record makes you wonder how most of the mainstream rock at the time ie bush stone temple pilots korn was even digestable by our fragile virgin ears it seems like those bands made music for primates while radiohead has made an album that transcends space and time each song sparkles with melodic brilliance and never is there a song that does not involve even a tiny bit of thinking outside the box from the djshadowesque drum beats of airbag to the minimalistic use of the glockenspiel in no surprises the album is a consistent step forward the melodies gush all over the place from the distorted voice of thom in climbing up the walls to his fragile tone in subterranean homesick alien one of my personal favourites in their entire catalog the lyrics flirt with genius from lines like ambition makes you look pretty ugly to i will take a quiet lifea handshake of carbon monoxide and they clearly have a unity to them revolving around the themes of robots and their effects on human emotionspersonality it may take a while to adjust to their complex sound and the subtle gimmicks they employ on each song but when you tap into the goods congratulations you have just reached valhalla and there is no turning back i always envision that on the day when space travel to the moon is successful for common folk i will immerse myself in ok computer and ask the pilot to show me the world as i would love to see it,5.00,1779
yep good cd songs are just good and catchy radiohead are a good band people should check them out,5.00,97
an amazing album the paranoid riffs blend perfectly with yorkes vocals a complete album even considering the average tracks subterranean homesick alien the tourist and airbag although i would agree this album deserves to receive best album of the last two decades i would find it hard to argue this against some of dylans best work or even revolver my favourite track is exit music for a film the song used at the end of romeo  juliet karma police paranoid android and no surprises were well chosen singles to give the public an idea of this album no one should not have this album in their collection it really is a must have many fans wish the band would return to this style of songwriting however if you were the band and had created this album there would be nowhere to go except criticism for sounding like their last album this is why i believe they changed tack completely for kid a,5.00,890
this is a perfect album there are not a lot of perfect albums from the 90s but this is one of them everything and i mean everything is right on ok computer in fact radiohead kind of fucked themselves over with this album because they will never be able to top it,5.00,262
do not go ballistic 4 stars is a very good rating i love this album it has impact but their later albums have ideas ok computers music and art are all of a package and that package seems to imply an idea but i cannot help but feel there is a pink floyd thing going on here you know sounds great when it first comes out but does not age well drop those torches i treasure my copy i just think that in 20 years i will still be playing kid a and amnesiac and possibly the bends on a regular basis and will break out ok computer once a year when similarlyaged friends are all gathered round in the gameroom in the basement enjoying whatever intoxicant is in vogue at the time and we can all smile and sigh and talk about what a wonderful age that was and how the young peckerwoods of today get away with everything five years ago i would have given this five stars and spoken of it as a classic but now that i have found gods face on the playside of the compact disc of peter brotzmanns machine gun i cannot bring myself to prostrate myself in obedience with the rest of the masses that said it is a classic,4.00,1103
it took about 24 hours for this album to change the way i look at music in a way pretty much no album ever has there are just songs on this album that sound like nothing i have ever heard even from other radiohead albums every track is great yes even fitter happier if for nothing else than to contribute to the overall tone of the album and i can find nothing wrong with it part pinkfloydish suite part chaotic emotional thrill ride quite frankly the best thing i have ever heard,5.00,480
1010  this is my first radiohead album i have listened to after all the publicity i have heard about it i expected it to be pretty good it took me a couple of listens to finally see why this album is so special this is the best album i have ever heard you will be amazed at how superb this album really is i could not just listen to a few songs on the album i would have to listen to the whole thing because it is so good all of the tracks are very good and fit perfectly together however i really like the tracks climbing up the walls and lucky,5.00,545
one of the best ever i just hope that they produce one more album with similar music before they disband,5.00,104
monumental release for the british press when it was first released and for some reason it is still believed to be one of the finest most perfect albums ever not really on the initial listen it was impressive but after years and years of repeated and occasional listening it is just simple somber pop music there are some excellent tracks like paranoid android and let down but after that it is just real drawn out luckily i grew out of the stage where i praise whatever thom yorke and co decide to shit in my mouth and ok computer just is not as monumental as it used to be,4.00,574
this cd is simply put the greatest album of alltime there are absolutley no flaws here only perfection it is simply amazing,5.00,123
this was one of those records that i bought when i left so i can boast that i liked the album without having followed the media wave that enveloped the band at the first listen i was still apprehensive as the bands sound had become colder and weirder compared to the previous the bends but then i could see the qualitative evolution of radiohead there was a conceptual evolution that made ok computers music appear impregnated with impressions about the modern world and its harmful effects on man good examples of this are the suffocating comfort of no surprises the coldness of fitter happier or the neurosis and paranoia of paranoid android musically it was also very remarkable since without creating anything truly new within rock it was an authentic breath of fresh air that brought about the end of the tired britpop scene personally i highlight two moments the spiritual energy of airbag that never seems to run out and the melancholic jangle rock of the guitars in letdown truly perfect moments,5.00,1003
this is a monumental achievement in all musical aspects for those of you who have not heard this album because of the hype surrounding it get over it and for the love of pete listen to it it is a leap above all other albums put out in the 90s in terms of musicality depth and lyricism it simultaneously sends you on a high and then slaps you back down to reality thanks to yorkes searing lyrics about modern man and commercialism paranoid android is a symphony in itself,5.00,470
i do not know where to begin other than to say that subterranean homesick alien is likely to remain my favourite radiohead song although knowing radiohead there are strong contenders that will eventually bite me in the ass for saying that but i digress,5.00,252
a very enjoyable ethereal recordtop 10 i do not think so but none the less exceptional,3.50,86
this was voted the greatest album of all time on channel 4s 100 greatest albums and while i would not go as far as too call the greatest it still is a fab album airbag is the best track on here and karma police is the best single terrific,4.00,238
my personal favorite album of the last 10 years paranoid android may be the best modern rock recording period this song still makes my neck hairs stand on end 8 years later,5.00,172
if you have already heard it you know how good it is if you have yet to hear it you probably think it is overhyped and cannot possibly be as good as everyone says it is this is wrong i normally buy albums have a few listens and promptly forget about them this is one of the few albums that after the first listen i had to play it all over again then spent the next few months playing it everyday and buying every radiohead item i could find andor afford all these years later it still has moments that blow me awaysend chills up my spinegive me goosebumpsplease add own cliche here in saying that i find every album radiohead have done since this to be dreadfully dull miserable and boring but that might just be me,5.00,715
i used to love this album a lot but it seems i have listened to it a few times too many guess it is time to move on still a damn fine record i would recommend it to anybody,4.00,172
it is unfortunate that because of the hype surrounding ok computer that so many have taken the i have to listen to what other people are not listening to and bash what is popular stance on it even if the popularity of this album is mainly only among serious music lovers there are not many britney spears fans listening to and enjoying this album so people need to stop bickering about whether it is too hyped and just examine the album for the music it contains with that said the music on this album is extraordinary people should listen to the hype because the sgt peppers of the 90s comparisons are valid in many ways while computer might not have the cultural impact of peppers it has had a similar impact on the music community with a brilliantly conceived and well executed concept about the dehumanization of people through machines lyrically thoughtful and musically enjoyable especially on highlights like airbag paranoid android letdown karma police no surprises and lucky ok computer deserves its place as the 1 album of the 1990s the fact that i just rattled off half the album as highlights should be a testament to its overall strength,5.00,1150
holy shit man is this kickass album deep and thought provoking every song on the album seems to interwine into each other to create a symphony of perfection and brilliance this is my favorite album by my favorite artist the bends are not too shabby neither,5.00,256
radioheads ok computer is a masterpiece and one of the most beautiful albums ever done,5.00,86
that is it sir you are leaving the crackle of pigskin the dust and the screaming the yuppies networking the panic the vomit the panic the vomit god loves his children god loves his children yeah nothing more needs be said on this album you can thank me later for sparing the world any more of that terribly overhyped but for a reason why not overhype one of the best most creative albums ever recorded you know the rest highlights paranoid android subterranean homesick alien karma police no surprises,5.00,501
my overall favourite have all their albums this is a priceless albumkid a and their latest album are all amazing however might need a little getting used to,5.00,156
this is the first radiohead album i was able to listen from the beginning to the end at my first listen i did not like many tracks from it like airbag electrictioning and fitter happier at that time i was only into the darker tracks such as lucky and exit music but now i pretty much appreciate each single minute of this album and i guess it made me change my idea about the heavier rocking songs red by kc made me loose a lot of some of my prejudices against more fast and noisy songs as well songs that i once could not stand like airbag coz i once considered to noisy are now definitely necessary to listen i am going to to appreciate the album entirely i love the dark and a lot of times melancholic tone of this album even kid a cannot be darker in my opinion and the creepy tracks from it are genuine artworks lucky is so touching that it became my favorite radiohead song and the progressive track paranoid android is so eargasmic that i doubt any radiohead fan in this world would not have loved it at the first listen airbag starts already rocking with soft and suave vocals by thom though and making your hair reach the ceiling with those great basslines and background sounds in an unforgetable intro that is as amazing as the intro of king crimsons album red and its instrumental is really strong and enjoyable it does make a superb pair with the next track paranoid android which would be their progressivest song divided in 4 parts the first part starts very tranquil making a good usage of acoustic tones and soft vocals then it slowly progresses into a heavier part and at the moment thom says you will remember you will remember best radiohead moment i am going to and it is even better in the live versions since he actually screams at that part the song shows his second face a stronger heavier one with a guitar work that is not 3rd grade as someone once qualified the guitarrists playing in this album after the angry part a sad and melancholic tone arrives at your ears with very touching vocals by thom and amazing backing vocals as well after it face 2 comes again and finishes the song with 5 stars leading to the next great tune subterranean homesick alien starts very trippy with great guitar notes flowing with thoms again soft vocals and neat keyboard arrangements this song creates a great atmosphere it is indeed very strong in terms of how you feel when listening to it you can easily appreciate the complexity of its instrumental and thoms vocal work which become a bit melancholic at the second vocal section of the song talking about melancholic the next track does make some tears born from your eyesexit music was a music done for a movie and it starts as a guitar solo with the sad vocal work then it gets a slide guitar section until the end that reminds me a lot of the live versions of celestial voices by pink floyd i do not enjoy the next track too much let down is a nice one and it is good since it makes the mood of the album a bit more shiny but it does not lose its melancholy tone mainly in the vocals which return in total power in karma police another great radiohead success from this album fitter happier is interesting scary it is nice to listen to the robot talking with those creepy background instrumentals a nice song nothing so much special about it thoughit is just different and therefore original and then electionnering comes the most heavy one from the album it is a good track i once disliked it but it surprisingly grew on me as i said before i am losing my restrictions against heavier rocking songs we then travel to climbing up the walls is it just me or does this song have some elements for their other good album kid a it really fits in kid as style except for the noisy part which is more rocky than what would look nice on kid a anyway it is another song that can be appreciated it is creepy as most of the album and since it is creepy i really like it heheheh eroki guess it is time to take a nap with the next songno do not shoot me ok i am not saying the next song is boring i am saying that it has one of those go sleep child songs feel it is a very sweet song very beautiful and one of the first ones i listened to when i started my radiohead fancraziness thom again makes some beautiful and soft vocals here hell the guy is one of the best vocalists ever now let us talk about lucky beautiful song no it is much more than this this is i am going to okcs best song and it is not only beautiful it is very beautiful sad wrist cutting and tear producer track it has 3 sections one with the trippy instrumental and thoms trippy vocals another just like the first one but with a very well done choir at the back of the song and a last one just like the second one but without thoms voice there is an awesome guitar solo between the second and third parts that progresses to part 3 with the great choirs which sound a bit differently now shorter and less sad and then there is the tourist a great track too with a sad tone almost as deep as the track before it is one it is a great final for a great album which ends here  so this is by far my favorite radiohead album their most trippy touching complex and musically agradable in my opinion and it is much more appreciated if listened to entirely not like the bends where it can also be enjoyed by listening to the tracks isolated,5.00,5356
way overrated the singles are all great and there are some other nice songs but this is not even close to the bends fitter happier  why,3.00,135
beautiful is fucking beautiful but i have yet to figure out if radiohead is the epochal band that is rumored around or crap,4.50,123
hard to get into for me but after all i find an extremely good album kind of pink floydish excellent album my favorite tracks ont this album are paranoid android and exit music for a film crazy album,4.50,199
here is a funny thing  even though i recognised the song no surprises from the first 5 seconds of the intro i never knew what it was called or that it was originally recorded by radiohead it is beautiful regardless of who wrote it that does not have anything to do with the main point i want to make i just figured it was a mildly amusing tangent i just want to say that radiohead quite blatantly pull the trick of building an album around an eps worth of good tracks karma police no surprises fitter happier maybe paranoid android the rest just sounds like still so much sterile 90s britpop,2.00,591
very few artists have the ability to express their intimate feelings of sadness and anger as thom yorke and company do in addition most of the compositions are splendid and the production and arrangements are very original if you feel depressed you better not listen to this album and even less the song exit music for a film radioheads best album followed by the fantastic the bends,4.00,383
i am not sure what a flawless album sounds like but this cannot be too far off base,5.00,83
i would give this five but i am saving it for when some album transforms my life so its as good as five stars what an album,4.50,123
damn those analogue fx,5.00,22
i do not think the album is perfect but it sure immerses you in an alien universe of its own making for one of the most cohesive sounding albums of the 90s and i do love the sonic textures in subterranean homesick alien let down and exit music better still is that this trio appears in a row the rather unbalanced climbing up the walls is definitely also a highlight,3.50,366
i always used to find radiohead dull when i was a casual music fan i heard that karma police and paranoid android were two of their better songs but when i listened to them i just found them plain dull then after getting sucked into the world of music more and more probably about a year later i gave those two songs another listen and was struck by how much i enjoyed them this time round i was anxious to get my hands on a copy of the whole ok computer album and hear more of radioheads stuff it is a bit clichd to say that this album is the best of the 90s or even the best of all time but for me personally there are only a select few albums that i prefer any which i rate 5 stars most albums i might listen to for a few days after getting them but i could not stop listening to this for a couple of weeks paranoid android and karma police are two amazing songs which are almost flawless and while it is based around a common theme there are songs with very differing tones like subterranean homesick alien and exit music for a film as this is so hyped it is one of those which everyone needs to hear whether you hate it or love it why does it not get five stars from me then i like it but there is something about it that is preventing it getting the highest possible rating paranoid android and karma police are perfect from start to finish but while there are not any bad songs a lot of them have parts that are amazing but also parts that are dull and boring still an amazing album but not quite on a five star level,4.50,1524
i used to hate radiohead i saw them as boring uninventive and basically mindless crap however through friends i decided to give this a try to see what all the fuss was about and i think it is decent but not brilliant the album starts of magnificently with three outstanding tracks airbag paranoid android and subteranial homesick alien let down and climbing up walls are both amazing however the rest of the album is mainly tiresome and dull though you have to realise the importance of this album i will not say its overrated just slightly disappointing to what i was expecting still worth buying though,3.50,604
this is for all you flamers radiohead is simply a band you get or you do not get before comparing the members of this band to apes as one reviewer beautifully did you should actually look at the tabs for their songs yes and please compare to the music that you ape comparers listen to yesthat is what i thought my first point is radiohead is unbelievably talented my next point is that radiohead is excruciatingly creative to the point where you feel like pulling your hair outbecause it is so creative the lyrics are uncomprehendable the music will rip your heart out and rip at itit is amazing alright alright this is not a review i am just mad that people actually think radiohead is crap i will admit it takes a liberal mind to like them their music is controversialno not in the way eminem wasit feels controversial it is different and people are not always ready to accept that ladies and gentleman we hope that you choke that you choke,5.00,942
what i love about this album is that it does not offer a quick fifty odd minutes of pointless nonsensical fun it has it is heartbreakingly beautiful moments it is pissed off moments and a bit of creepiness to top it off it is challenging and happens to sound better with each listen paranoid android is as close to perfection as any song can get i love the lyrics and style changes some might call this album depressing but i seriously do not find it to be so it actually lifts my spirit every time i hear iteven no surprises gets a smile out of me every song on here is a highlight except fitter happier it is an interesting track but not one i could listen to again and again ok computer certainly lives up to it is ridiculous hype and i have and will happily listen to it for a very long time,5.00,795
ok computerthe 3rd album from radioheadis it better than the bendswell i would have to say yes and scream it out passionately because i have no doubt about it that this album is better than the bendswhich to be honest is a huge achievement because the bends is a near perfect albumbut this is a perfect albumnot only are the songs all flawless but the meanings behind the songs always keep you coming back for more the album i feel is quite distanced from anything on the bends and its fair to say that the songs are more complexparanoid androidis a perfect example of this and i can see why people call it a modern bohemian rhapsody with better lyricsnever before have i seen an album that bursts with classic and famous songs like this doesmaybe nevermind comes near but when listening to ok computer you have a feeling that you have heard it somewhere beforea sure winner then examples of this are the beautiful intro to no surprisesthe guitar work in paranoid androidand the chorus in karma police i really cannot emphasize how much this needs to be in your collectionit is more than an albumit is the best album ever createdthe meaningthe vocalsthe talentit is perfectmy favorite album everwhy go on thenmy other favorite albums i may like but nonconvey this emotion or imageryok computer should really be in the louvre museum in parisit is art of the highest form and i could talk about this album more and draw more meaning from it than i could with any painting if you liked the bends buy this and then love radiohead and swallow up the whole collection like hundreds of others before havesomething i will do myself very soon,5.00,1633
british music seems to fall into two categories the diy camp that brought us punk and the it came out of art school camp that is clearly the home for radiohead while ok computer may have been a revelation to 15 year olds anyone who has been listening to music other than standard radio content for any period of time has already heard the styles that are melded together here so it is not the unique work of art that it was claimed to be the vocals could be called anguished but to these ears yorke is simply whining for the most part and is the weakest part of the music also noone in the band is going to win a best of instrument on any polls in the near future so much for the down side ok computer does work it stands up to repeated listens which is more than most music released today when yorke does let loose he actually has a decent voice and the songs dare i call them songs  the musical pieces are kept interesting by yorkes quirky arrangements obtuse lyrics and use of nonpop sounds the sum is greater than the parts an interesting work that is not the saviour of music but does give some tired ears hope in this cookie cutter idol culture,3.50,1150
this is one of the greatest albums of all time but definitely the best album of the 90s radiohead is our led zeppelin so go and listen my children,5.00,146
8 out of the 12 songs are solid solid solid the album starts out with the highly underrated airbag the guitars really drive this song and greenwoods ambient almost egyptian sounding guitar solo is purely amazing the screeching sonic like sounds that are incorporated into this song at the end are worth the listen aloneparanoid android follows and the word classic is all that needs to be said next we have subterranean homesick alien which i thought to be very vague repetitive and lacking energy exit music for a film is a sad accoustical piece that was recorded for the film romeo and juliet the song starts out slow and a bunch of eerie noises are incorporated towards the end which gives the song alot of energy and really transform the listener into the world of the capulets and montagues letdown is one of the most soothing and uplifting tracks of this album the guitar work is among the most melodic that i think i have ever heard the song works towards an amazing buildup that will blow the listener away karma police is a mundane jazzy like piano piece that is slow and dry until the last 130 when things really pick up and become energetic and really fun another classic the second half is not as good as the first fitter happier was definetly a filler electioneering is probably the worst track on the album i felt it was way too political climbing up the walls is very eerie and it takes you to a very very very dark place no surprises is another melodic piece that uses a xylophone that sounds really cool lucky is a great guitar piece with a really great solo a choir piece is incorporated into the song and that really gives the song alot of feeling and energy the last song the tourist i felt to be somewhat of a letdown there is no energy at all and it almost makes you want to fall asleep some people loved i was one who hated it,5.00,1849
one of the landmark albums of the 90s and really of all time it showed that true concept albums were not dead and there were still real statements to be made through the medium of rock that did not have to do with depression and how much the world sucks and how we have to stick it to the man because he is out to get us no there is much more at work here on ok computer and it is actually probably worth saying the whole idea behind the album is that in our more and more computerized world technology is getting a hold of us and many of us do not even realize it we use everyday objects like tvs and computers but do not realize we have become a slave to the machines we rely on them and they can definitely be useful as the lifesaving airbag in the first song but if aliens from another planet were to see us and how we live they would probably get a big kick out of seeing us as described in subterrainien homesick alien sure there are some of us who see the light and want to escape from the grip of all the reliance on technology as in no surprises but there will always be the society that you must conform to outlined in the eerie fitter happier the album ends wit ha ray of hope but an overall sense of doom warning us of our downfall if we continue this downward spiral we have been taking the last several decades now this is hard to say what the album really means i gave you my interpretation the lyrics on this album are incredibly vague but that is good  it opens it up for intelligent discussion and even reform if taken in the right way the music while tedious towards the end is surprisingly good and flows nicely it sort of gets a backseat to the lyrics but that too is alright because it is what radiohead tried to do they were not trying to make a sonic masterpiece of rock and roll  they were trying to make a statement and it probably succeeded beyond their wildest dreams,4.50,1895
thom yorks genius has never been more evident his lyrics delve into the heart of current issues of commercialization and critique them perfectly his commentary on modern music in karma police is clever in the lines he buzzes like a fridge definitetly a their best album and an effective transition between the rock sound of pablo honey and the bends and the electronic sound of kid a and amnesiac,5.00,396
wow when i first listened to this album i was in awe the songs are so spacious and great when i listen to this album i close my eyes and i feel like i am in this weird dream i often consider this album the dark side of the moon of the 90s it is one of those albums you most own the best track on the album would have to be paranoid android the song is about 6 minutes long and is split up into three parts this song is somewhat similar to queens bohemian rhapsody there is not one song i do not like except the track titled fitter happier which is more of a filler and has a computertized voice speaking the album ends with the tourist the song ends the great album in such a perfect way this album has definately gotten me into radiohead and i would also reccommend picking up the bends by radiohead which was produced a year or two before this one,5.00,849
55 stars is my actual rating this whole albums is just amazing i cannot really say anything that has not been said before but this is in my top ten favorites of all time if you have not heard it hear it and if you do not have it get it,5.00,235
a little too indulgent for me lucky apart i much prefer the bends,3.00,65
my old review a pretty good album but fucking overrated if i hear one more person call this the perfect rock album i am going to explode i much preferred the bends and kid a the bends had its acoustic touch and kid a gave a damn good crack at electronica i was slightly unsure where this album was going musically though and quite frankly i was not overly impressed although you cannot deny the emotion that went into it thom yorke has a fucking good voice and the song writing is impressive quite good but definitely not their best three stars new reviewalright so its grown on me its pretty damn good still do not like karma police though,4.50,640
if you do not like ok computer the first time you listen to it listen again you will not catch all of the layers of sound and all of the beauty in your first listen or even your first ten if you are not prepared to give that much time to a single album then do not buy ok computer but if you think you can handle it it is worth the time and money,4.50,346
one of my favourite albums of all time depressing as hell and the fitter happier track is complete and utter crap but its one of those albums that i never tire of listening toever,5.00,179
amazing album one of their best every song is great no exceptions,4.50,65
where do i start this has to be the best album of all time that anyone can ask for i do not think i ever see an album so ever well done in my life this album is almost flawless i have never skipped any tracks while listening to this cd which means that all of the songs are great and you never get sick of them if you do not own this album i should shoot you or tell you to go to your nearest music store and pick it up immediately so you know what people are really listening to these days this album is godlike,5.00,512
this album is the best thing radiohead have ever done and that is for one reason and one reason alone the songs not the words which were what grabbed me on hail to the thief and amnesiac or the music which is what grabbed me on kid a but the songs as whole entities if the songs are split down into their component parts there is not much that is oneoff special here the riffs are better on the bends there are not any songs that can touch a wolf at the door off hail lyrically even the tunes are not always perfect but when everythings put together this is radiohead at its most consistent take no surprises for instance one of the best tracks on the album and a contender for the saddest radiohead song of all time on its own the lyrics are poetic but not a masterpiece the tune is sad but not to the point that its going to make you cry that only happens when the two get fused together the lyrics fit perfectly with the music on everything presented here something radiohead have not always been perfect at and it is this perhaps that gives ok computer its feeling of consistence the other point that needs mentioning  in order to illustrate why this is arguably the most important rock record of the 90s  is paranoid android about the yuppies and fakers he met in la the song proved that an indie epic was not an oxymoron and it contains the best radiohead line ever the bit about the kicking squealing gucci little piggie a phrase which sums up the 90s and the mood of this record perfectly other standout moments include the fantastic last half of karma police when after melancholic riffing the song suddenly expands into a vast operatic chorus with a little help from some johnny greenwood guitar magic the riffs in airbag and electioneering and the ultrasad exit music for a film which indeed was used as exit music in the film romeo and juliet and so does not fit quite in with the tone of the record if it did it would undoubtedly be the best thing on there that it is not speaks volumes about just what a fantastic beast ok computer actually is if you do not own this record make a move to rectify the situation now,5.00,2128
just as nirvana managed to popularize and refine punk rock with nevermind radioheads ok computer taps into the rich vein of experimental rock and breathes new life and mass appeal into it is often times elusive heart odd time signatures evershifting dynamics strange textures and unfamiliar sounds comingle within the brilliantly layered production creating a swirling disorienting and unpredictably heady mix radioheads music in general and on this album in particular seems to polarize music lovers their music is without a doubt dark alienating and rather elitist in its avantgarde tendencies it seems that ones opinion of the music is based on what type of sounds their ears are attuned to someone weened on radiofriendly hits will probably not be moved by this music what makes radiohead great is their conscious evolution as artists and the fact that they seem to have absorbed the entire history of popular and underground music ably transmuting it into a new and highly personal style with ok computer they have cracked open the stubborn she will of expectation and revealed the myriad possibilities that lie within,5.00,1123
this album has changed my life and i am totally serious about that anyone who has any doubts about the spiritual healing that comes from music should listen to this album and really let it sink into your pores i never could look at music the same way again after i heard ok computer for the first time radiohead has opened my eyes and continues to do so everytime i put on this album or for that matter anything they have released after this as well best album of the 90s,5.00,471
great album from a great band this was a bit of a departure from their previous offerings but it paid off and paved the way for their future releases great feeling of atmosphere and such a full and rich sound some really beatiful songs here paranoid android is a modern classic if you only get one radiohead album get this,4.00,322
ok computer is an amazing album one of my personal favourites it does not have one bad song on it i cannot praise this enough the only problem some people might have with it is that it is all very depressing there are no happy songs whatsoever and alot of people do not like this but each to their own taste i think it is good to listen to some depressing music every once in a while the highlights of this album in my opinion are exit music for a film karma police paranoid android and no surprises basically if you do not own this album then buy it as soon as possible,4.50,570
once again a modern rock masterpiece every song on here has it is own personality most notably on karma police in which thom yorkes ironic moaning makes it so the listener is not entirely sure if he should be sad or not climbing up the walls is edgy creepy and unsettling in the best of ways it has a special uneasiness about it that no one but radiohead can do what i like most about ok computer is that it is not so focused on guitars and rocknroll and sounds like u2 and other people that i know influenced them unlike the bends radiohead uses a lot more electronics and keyboards rather than guitars which gives the album a different and arguably better sound and feel with that said electioneering is worth a mention because it is probably the most straightforward rock song on the album proving they can still play guitar and still rock all of the quirks they incorperate into ok computer works heavily to their advantage one of those albums that they probably never will be able to top because they have not managed to do so yet,5.00,1035
my first mystique contact with music,5.00,36
the sweetest radiohead album that the quintet have produced they have still got the guitar going on like the bends but with more experimental sounds leaning towards the future in amnesiac and hail to the thief a great selection of songs with just one tiny blip in track 7 not bad enough to put the rest of the album down buy this album a must for any music fan,5.00,360
one of the best albums of all time and without a doubt left unforgettable classics like paranoid android karma police and no surprises it was the album that woke up the sad rock genre that was later followed by bands like travis coldplay starsailor keane influenced many areas of music,5.00,285
when i originally reviewed this album i gave it 35 stars i thought a lot of it wad depressing the vocalist was whiney and fitter happier was unlistenable well it is still a little depressing the vocalist is whiney and fitter happier is unlistanable but it is a great album thankfully karma police is on the album it is easily my favorite song and if it was not there i may have never gone back to listen to it the more i listen to this album the more i like it let down does not do much for me and fitter happier is boring but paranoid android karma police electioneering and climbing up walls are great songs,5.00,609
where do i begin the sheer enormity of this record has blessed the ears of a generation and surely those to come the songwriting power of thom yorke mixed with the adaptation and creativity of the other band members makes for an unprecidented and unbelievable collage of brilliantly orchestrated songs i will go through the album step by step track oneairbag quite possibly the best opener in the history of rock is a buzzy upbeat and poppy song about thom yorkes car accident quite spacey lyrics and sound especially the line i am back to save the universe this song is the most accesible therefore a good opener to skeptical listeners track twoparanoid android the most widely associated song with this album it has elements of spanish percussion and other things that cannot even be classified possibly the hardest song on the album excluding electioneering it has a distinct angry tone to it without becoming obnoxious track 3 sub homesick alien ah this song is about an aliens point of view looking upon earth and talking about how uptight we are gorgeously harmonic track 4exit music for a film this song is very eerie and haunting the lyrics are graphic we all hope you choke and seem to express great anguish it reminds me alot of 225 for some reason track 5 let down this is the best song ever made the spacey eerie but poppy droning guitar and effects throw you in to a whirl of sensory enigmas the end is especially amazing the twinkling sound fades away into the next tracks prominent piano track 6 karma police one of the most popular songs on the album it shows the keyboarding strengths of the band amoung other things in my opinion it is as if it is about a man stepping out to look at his life from another person then saying arrest this man he talks in maths or that he talks complicated and cannot relax this balled is one of yorkes masterpieces track 7fitter happier it is more of a collage of soundbytes with an eerie backdrop than a song mocking our everyday pet peeves track 8 electioneering just a basic rock song and some say the weak point on the album it does not fit as well as the others with the tone of the album track 9 climbing up the walls the most eerie and creepy song it is lyrics imply that the character is waiting inside the victims house but it never is clear not a song to listen to alone at night track 10 no suprises a brilliant but sad song with high guitar and low bass at the beginning for an ironic twist of contrast track 11lucky a very sad song with profoundly depressing atmosphere track 12 the tourist god they just had to go out with a bang an closer of epic proportions so there you have it the greatest album of all time produced by the greatest band of all time never again in my lifetime will i hear music this godlike,5.00,2775
if there was ever an album that is close as good as the beatles sgt peppers lonely hearts club band this would be it like the beatles it is just interesting how the band would shift gears from brit pop at that time oasis was at the top to experimental rock just amazing especially the song exit music for a film how the song builds up to its climax once again kudos to radiohead,5.00,378
i almost want to deduct it a star for being too popular and wellknown but it is very very good top ten of all time maybe not but i will not argue i like the bends a little better though and i do not think kid a is far behind i will say that the last track on ok computer is one of the most unique and underrated songs i can think of,5.00,332
definitely one of the best albums of the 90s calm strange somehow appealing this album is a stepstone in rock history,5.00,117
a great album i love listening to it i just wish i had started listening to this stuff earlier,4.50,94
this is as close to perfection an album has come since dark side of the moon brilliant,5.00,86
flows smoothly and without errors just like a good computer,5.00,59
i would never thought much of radiohead in the past yet upon hearing from a friend that their latest single was quite interesting in a progressive kind of way and after seeing the video for paranoid android one night i was intrigued here was a single like no other six and a half minutes long with numerous sections and changes intertwining acoustic guitars and latin percussion kick off with the opening lyrics please can you stop this noise i am trying to get some rest from all the unborn chicken voices in my head this leads into a extremely funky and catchy little progression on acoustic with a squashed flat rhodes piano in the background which then kicks into a fullon assault with screaming piercing guitar solos then it is over for a moment then out of the rubble rises layered voices and grainy mellotron choirs like a rock n roll russian orthodox mass which builds and builds until we are back into the screaming solos this time complete with swooping analogue synth squelches and noise and then the whole thing lurches to a dead stop i would read rave reviews of the album ok computer so i had to check it out and i could not fault it this album is an instant classic the band has left no stone unturned in their quest for interesting sounds this is not the simple guitar pop of creep musically the band has matured immensely favourite moments being the clipped and compressed drum loops of airbag the fuzz bass with it is voice breaking and huge emotional climax of exit music for a film and the eerie layered and distorted vocals and screams of frustration and despair unable to penetrate the thick white noise screaming violins and relentless hollow snare in climbing up the walls it is clear from the lyric sheet that thom yorke has a fairly bleak vision of humanity and the monsters that we have created and are seemingly out of control yorke it seems is wrestling with those paradoxes intrinsic to a modern society unsure of and a little anxious as to what the future holds this is a vision which no doubt resonates with a lot of people as this album is incredibly popular and is surely one of the defining musical and lyrical statements of the late 90s,5.00,2172
okay computer  zaphod to eddie the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy i had to start with an ok computer and hitchhikers guide comparison i am sorry i just had to but in my opinion this is the best album of all time and it did not even need references to the worlds greatest book to help it either this was the second radiohead album i heard and i fell in love with it instantly the main reasoning being this thom yorke has a very unique voice that i just want to make love to for all eternity oh and the musicianship is also better than most bands jonny greenwood is more talented than most people in just a one little strand of hair found somewhere between his knee and ankle exit music for a film paranoid android and karma police are my favorite tracks on the album paranoid android is one of my favorite songs of all time and possibly even my number one sure i have no idea what the song means but does anyone every song on ok computer in their right selves are masterpieces even fitter happier it fits where it is connecting together the whole album which has a central theme of technology advancement in the society ironically the song is about making oneself better sung talked by a computerized voice airbag is a good opener for the album somewhat about a car accident he had in his life but then he yelps out in an interstellar burst  i am back to save the universe and all i can see matter in the universe split in two and out flies thom yorke in a multicolored superhero outfit ready to save those who need it i also like electioneering which is another one of the songs that does not seem to get much love either it is their hardest song and most rocking the only problem i had with it is that i need more cowbell thom has said that the album does not have a concept at all even if there is or not there is still that theme of technology soiling society throughout the album they are trying to reach out to you to tell you that just step away from it all even if it is for a little while in the tourist it is about people tourists not stopping to view the beauty wherever they are and just trying to quickly get through the place and the only thing that is stopping them is the technology of the world that is how i see the album as being i am not a deep thinker and probably took other peoples ideas but that is the way the world goes all i can say is that ok computer is the best album of the 90s and also my favorite album of all time as much as anyone who could somehow hate radiohead there will always be one major let down to them no matter what happens radiohead will rule this planet earth forever,5.00,2615
this is genre defining music the album comes out shooting with airbag and paranoid android the best songs on the album it starts to sink after that as the other songs cannot live up to the first 2 tracks but the album is still great i will not give it 5 stars because of the pos track fitter happier that song ruins the flow of the album however it picks itself back up and this album is more than worthy of your money if you like alternative music at all oh and if you do not get it the first time you listen wait a week and you will,4.50,534
an excellent album my favorite track is the song thom yorke wrote about the dullest fucking people on earth paranoid android,5.00,124
one of the greatest albums ever recorded period yorkes soaring vocals are remarkable and the band have never sounded more coherent on first listen the songs sound strange and unfamiliar but stick with it and soon you will fall in love with it has there ever been a more moving closer than the tourist lyrically also radiohead here were streets ahead of their contemporaries genius,5.00,380
it may be the best album ever it is initially hard to start out with as are most of radioheads albums but its well worth the effort the more time you invest in this album the more you will receive from it sonically and creatively it cannot be beat,5.00,247
it took me several listens before i could appreciate it but i agree that ok computer deserves all of the critical praise being heaped upon it though i do not fully see the concept link of this album most of the songs provided a perfect backdrop for the year 2000 scare to be sure it will probably go down as the most characteristic but not necessarily the greatest album of the 90s i contend that it is not even the best from the class of 1997 that award in my humble opinion belongs to i can hear the heart beating as one by yo la tengo however lists and rankings are of secondary importance what really matters is the content and why radiohead felt compelled to make this album many songs on ok computer evoke a cold cruel world where progress and technology have enslaved the human spirit for all of the modern technological advances that were created to make our lives easier we have become subservient to them for example can you recall a time when people did not carry around pagers and cell phones we have become so dependent upon instant communication that it has exacted a toll namely that we have become disconnected with the world around us we are not mature enough a society to fully handle our own creation and like the proverbial hamster in the cage we work harder and faster to get nowhere ambition makes you look pretty ugly sneers singer thom yorke on the bohemian rhapsody style paranoid android yet radiohead is very ambitious on ok computer not content with producing a disposable piece of merchandise like so many of their contemporaries they want to make a meaningful album that actually contains some substance and dare i say something that can be considered as art ok computer has been dismissed by some as an imitation of pink floyds 1970s work for example the dark psychological overtones in climbing up the walls sounds like a companion piece to passages from the wall however there is one noticeable difference between the two bands yorke infuses his lyrics with signs of humanity a trait that was sometimes missing from pink floyd lead singer roger waters songs where waters assumed the role of sanctimonious observer yorke takes on the persona of the everyman we side with yorke because instead of condemning or passing judgment he alternates between frustration and resolution on the other hand the sonic landscape radiohead creates does invoke pink floyd guitar textures abound as does studio wizardry in the form of electronic beeps and noises these sounds perfectly capture the thematic mood on which yorke hangs his occasionally obscure lyrics a mournful cello as if playing at a requiem opens the album followed by the sound of sleigh bells as if someone is christmas wish was answered entitled airbag yorke sings with both awe and a feeling of invincibility at living through an automobile accident colin greenwoods percolating bass darts in and out like the sound of a heart beating rapidly in an interstellar burst i am back to save the universe it is a circular argument that in an album that sharply questions modern technology if not for safety innovations the protagonist in the song would not have survived of course depending on how far back you consider technology an intrusion if there were no automobiles there would be no auto accidents in the first place the new lease on life offers yorke and his mates a chance to view exactly what kind of a society we live in and the answer is not pretty dreamy and ethereal subterranean homesick alien shares the uptight world bob dylan speaks of in his similarly titled classic but here yorke ponders about what life would be like among extraterrestrials and how they must view us and up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets notice that by songs end yorke does not state he wants to live with such aliens only that he wishes to visit another world despite the monotony and triviality of our world he still feels a connection to it since travel in an alien spacecraft must remain a fantasy we are forced to confront life on earth immediately catchy let down belies the upbeat music yorke sings about transport motorways and tramlinesstarting and then stoppingtaking off and landingnumerous methods of transportation but nowhere to go and nothing to do once you get there the emptiest of feelings disappointed people clinging onto bottles the exhausted way yorke sings those first lines embodies the blandness of daily life and the need to break free of the routine when yorke laments crushed like a bug in the ground he speaks for anyone stuck in a deadend job a deadend relationship a deadend town or a combination of the three yet the music remains full of life as if to say that things are never as bad as they appear eventually it motivates yorke who vows to grow wings and break out of this rut the ending keyboard piece reminds me of millions of morning commuters lining up for the train like so many ants on a trail karma police presents us with an authoritarian nightmare where conformity is the name of the game and individuality is swiftly eradicated yorke snaps out of it with the line for a minute therei lost myself admitting that it was all a terrible thought he dreamt up or was it upon closer examination his voice echoes in reverb indicating his line of losing it might be the dream and that the karma police a real kafkaesque troop that notion is reinforced when a guitar imitating a siren enters from the far right channel and hovers over the remainder of the song before whirring to a discomforting close the orwellian fitter happier could well be the most chilling cut on the disc on the back of the cd it is listed separately and in a smaller font from the other tracks the centerpiece of the album it is a monologue spoken by well an ok computer phrases of conventionality are strung together giving the impression of a soulless conforming life form the karma police have succeeded in reprogramming this person to make him beneficial to society the cacophonous score is a proper background for the words favours for favours fond but not in love at a better pace slower and more calculated no chance for escape calm fitter happier and more productive a pig in a cage on antibiotics in an attempt to better himself by fitting in with societys values this person has had the individuality sucked right out of him and may as well be artificial electioneering is a straightforward if obvious song about how politicians will prostitute themselves in order to secure votes during their campaign they allow themselves to be manipulated by public opinion once in office however it is the politicians who pull the strings and betray the trust bestowed on them by voters it is apparent that they are part of the problem not part of the solution and that any social reform must include a change in the way we elect government officials the band plays fierce and tough on this number if karma police and fitter happier are the two most totalitarian numbers on the album then no surprises is its most touching jonny greenwoods guitar plays like a lullaby throughout but it is yorkes voice tired and worldweary that takes center stage there is the allusion to electioneering in a line about the government but the opening verse is the focal point of the theme a heart that isfull up like alandfill a job that slowlykills you bruises that will not heal living in a world that has grown accustomed to modern conveniences and all its bells and whistles we often fail to stop and enjoy the simple things in life like a flower garden or a warm handshake from a friend at the close of this achingly beautiful song the character is planning a quiet suicide to forever shut out the alarms and surprises that are killing him ok computer closes with the lovely ballad the tourist akin to subterranean homesick alien i picture the title character as outside of this world and quite possibly outside of our time like a messenger from the future again the lyrics are sung dreamily as if in slow motion on the final line yorke cries out hey man slow down slow downidiot slow down slow down but he does not sing maliciously idiot is not meant as an insult but as a respectful admonition like calling someone silly he wants us to pause for a moment a long moment take a deep breath and evaluate exactly what kind of a world we have created with all of our technological toys exit music for a film is the one song that does not fit the feel of this album with a theme lifted from romeo and juliet indeed the song played over the closing credits of the 1996 film adaptation it is a hushed intimate encounter of two lovers running away from disapproving parents it does an adequate job of capturing the naive sentiment of youth however its inclusion on the album and its parting shot we hope that you choke run counter to the rest of the tracks a quick note on the artwork of the album stanley donwood who has been called the seenbutnotheard member of radiohead designed it a photo of a freeway intersection graces the cover but becomes blurry in the distance in the upper righthand corner is a picture sign that reads lost child the commentary is that we have lost our way in the world we created there are other figures on the cover but they are just silhouettesthe body is there but the soul is missing inside the booklet are numerous visual references to the songs on the album arranged to aid the listener into focusing on key lines at the conclusion of the tourist a timer goes off radiohead has finished cooking up its masterpiece your destiny is served,4.50,9670
a great album but let down with an average run of tracks from 79 in fitter happier electioneering and climbing up the walls which keep it far from receiving the hyperbolic accolades from me i was never such a fan of paranoid either but seem to be very much the odd one out the bends means more to me and kid a blew my mind more,4.00,327
this album is perfect there is not a bad song on here and the track listing is perfect airbag is the best opening and the tourist loops it right back again at the end the whole album shimmers with ambition and though it stands as one of the best albums ever it sent radiohead into the world of avantgarde experimentalism with mixed results,5.00,339
after telling my dark secret of never hearing radiohead on the rym message board my friend harmonica dave made me a copy of this album i let it sit around for about a week and tossed it on not sure what to expect and i was indeed impressed in fact the first four songs on this album played again and again all over my listening environment over time i have warmed up to the remainder of the album as well this bands mixture of dreamy pink floydisms and epic tuneage sits well at my house,4.50,487
this album is a shining example of perfect production,5.00,53
the bends with brakes on let down and climbing up the walls are absolutely magnificent though,4.00,93
what to say about this great album i do not want to add anything but a little curiosity listen to the song in the square by the pretty thing late 60s group with a very valid psychedelic period tell me if the opening chorus is not the same as that of paranoid android  haihaihai tom i fall into originality  anyway all this does not affect the magnificent work of the radioheads,5.00,377
sure it is good very different and way ahead of it is time how the heck were they able to get a song as complicated weird and out there onto main stream mtv back in the day do not get me wrong i do love it but main stream does not usually latch on to something so artsy fantastic album buy this and your friends will think you are cool,4.00,335
character studies in a soontocome dystopian future backed by expansive prog rock soundtracks this music shows a chilling reflection of orwellian paranoia the coldness of technology and the frailties of the human spirit one of those few big picture albums that actually understands the point it is trying to make yorkes falsetto croon greenwood and obriens guitar heroics orchestral flourishes it is all spot on ok computer was my first true musical love which clearly dates myself as a fairly junior music appreciator still i am amazed that even as a young teenager who could not yet fully comprehend the themes of this album hell i still probably cannot fully appreciate them this music still spoke to me on a level miles above anything that i had previously heard the ultimate 90s album both in quality and in its thematic focus,5.00,830
q you are in a band called radiohead and you have just taken the world by storm with your groundbreaking album the bends where to from here a you match it with an equally brilliant album that will win over all those that were under a rock when you released the last one,5.00,269
radiohead finally gets their due here the bends was a classic album and certaintly much better appreciated after this album broke them huge but the fact remains that this album broke them huge cranking up the spacey on their tunes radiohead tossed off the u2 comparisons and went ahead to become the next pink floyd this record is sprawling and diverse eschewing pop song conventions in favor of longer weirder and intertwined semistories about a disassociation through technology the kicker is damn these are some catchy tunes and as it turns out five guys playing regular instruments can make some pretty complicated music with this record radiohead firmly assured themselves relevancy at the end of the 20th century,4.50,718
i like the dreamy sound and rifs on the the album,3.50,49
after the enormous commercial and critical success of their second album the bends radiohead went back to the drawing board for their next lp release and boy they did not disappoint when this behemoth was released way back in may 1997 airbag  about the fictional experience of being in a car crash paranoid android  a bohemian rhapsody for the 20th century subterranean homesick alien  superbly produced exit music for a film  a spinetingling goth ballad let down  another highlight from the radiohead catalogue karma police  complete with famous chorus fitter happier  this is a different kind of interlude electioneering  the most rocky song on the album climbing up the walls  a claustrophobic rocker about going mad no surprises  containing the most famous riff of all time lucky  acoustic delight the tourist  a curious album closer it is hard to describe just how advanced this album was upon its release in 1997 and it has not aged very much since then ok computer is without question the bridging gap between the rock music of the bends and the electronic experimentation of kid a critics everywhere have gushed over this ambitious album and is regularly described as the best album over i am in no mood to disagree,5.00,1223
while i do like this album i am fully aware that it is full on pretentious art rock this does not however make me love it any less focussing a lot on the vocals and using spacey sounds with acoustic guitars is what catches me every time with this disc i am talking about the song exit music of course ok computer not only has it is pop moments no one will ever forget karma police but it also has the glory of being the album that proved radiohead was not a one hit wonder excellent album although not deserved of all of it is hype still very good,4.00,547
i remained secretly awake to contemplate the darkness waiting for absolute silence  for my parents to go to sleep  to hear in the distance the noise of cars going who knows where in my childhood imagery the night was an anthill of special people aliens who wandered to places of real life traveled stopped to talk about those little wonders that i was already beginning to take for granted a few years later i stopped completely i gnawed at the night on both sides i lost that flavor i realized that the people the places the streets are the same as during the day with less traffic less light less noise that is all but the dream was resurrected in july 1997 attracted by the karma police video i bought ok computer radioheads third rehearsal their consecration after the excellent pablo honey of 93 and the bends of 95 highly anticipated by fans from all over the world and from the world of music in general ok computer did not disappoint the expectations indeed it changed rock and invented a new way of making music pages on pages of magazines books websites have been written in the last 6 years to describe this record as one of the most influential in the entire history of music certainly the most important album of the 90s together with nevermind of which it represents the the other side of the same coin the discontent of an entire generation with no more dreams and ideals the revolution is in the use of the computer as a means to shape sensations alongside traditional instruments electronics not an end in itself and the daughter of a blind faith in progress the only and true religion of the west but an electronics slave who raises her head and rebels  i am born again  in the neon sign  scrolling up and down  from airbag i do not think i need to add anything else to this stream of objective praise and i would like to explore the record from my own personal point of view sitting on the armchair in the living room i listened to it on headphones for the first time but not all of it while my parents were there to see a movie and my brother was playing on the computer it was enough for me to taste the first six tracks up to karma police libretto in hand to read the lyricspoetry to be stunned and decide to listen to it again the next day  alone at home without being disturbed by the slightest noise or external agent so on the second listen i understood what had left me speechless the night before after so many years in ok computer i had rediscovered my childhood all those little wonders of which it was made my magical night populated by alienmen and also the inexorable loss of it all  transport  motorways and tramlines  starting and then stopping  taking off and landing  the emptiest of feelings  from let down the record in fact does not speak directly of that lost world of mine evidently not only mine but of everyone but of its negation that is the false perfection of western democracies  ambition makes you look pretty ugly  kicking screaming gucci little piggy  from paranoid android here and there you can see a light  i would show them the stars and the meaning of life  from subterranean homesick alien a window on that infinite night but overall the record crying about the loss of innocence and the pain that follows trying to frame it within radioheads tenyear discography ok computer represents the painful awareness of the status quo in the following and discussed albums the poet thom yorke will try to react with anger to this transformation that takes place in each of us as we become adults slaves of a culture forged to create slaves  riot shields  voodoo economics  it is just business  from electioneering does not it seem very uptodate however what makes ok computer essential and indispensable as a record but also and above all as a voice out of the chorus is its calling all of us children of this falseperfect world to the innocence of the child in which a handshake hides the deception and the word is always empty of meaning what makes ok computer beautiful is the incarnation of this unconventional voice in that wonderful thom yorke and the skilful use of all the instruments including computers by the rest of the band sometimes when i get home late and everyone is asleep i take my worn and livedin copy of ok computer from the cd shelf and insert it into the portable player i close my eyes in the distance i can still hear the noise of the cars of the aliens wandering in search of those places of real life,5.00,4476
when radiohead released ok computer in 1997 they had just been rehabilitated by their last record from being considered as a onehitwonder and although the bends contained some 12 exactlyreal great statements of modern art rock nobody expected radiohead to grow as big as they got withafter this album in an interstellar burstim back to save the universe thom yorke sings in the chorus of the very first song airbag not yet knowing how right he would be what promise the final guitar bits of the song is held by paranoid androids amazing solo here a band is breaking through to the appreciated soundscapes of a new century not only by great guitar play what concerning radiohead wouldnt play a role any longer on their next two albums but the creation of a musical world of its own involving punk electioneering folk exit music for a film ambient climb up the walls and gregorian choir parts among other stile thus although radiohead became really huge until today with this record they created something that always would be bigger than themselves,5.00,1047
just like thousands and thousands of other people ok computeris in my opinion the greatest album ever made it is one of the only maybe only albums i consider to be absolutely flawless this is even including fittier happier i think that it fits nicely in with the album flowing nicely out of karma police and into electioneering it just puts a nice little break from the first half of the cd into the next i could listen to ok computer anytime of any day if i could live with only one object in the world this album would definitely be that one thing the album has an almost dreamlike atmosphere to it when i listen to it i just want to drift away feel and experience the album if not even one song on this album strikes a chord inside of you then you might want to go to a doctor to make sure there is nothing wrong with you i love every aspect of this cd from the beginning of the sleigh bells all the way to the very last ping i wished that paranoid android could have gone on for hours but we all do not get what we wish for this is an album that could have been made in 1950 or even 2050 and still be a classic it will always be able to stand the test of time no matter what it is a great album in all aspects and influences me in every way possible i cannot imagine myself being alive without ever hearing this album in my life this will always be at the very top of my alltime favorite albums list in my opinion radiohead out did any band with this album and only they are the ones who can top their accomplishment so who knows what will come from them in the future although i am sure they will never be able to top their flawless classic and so this must come to an end i shall quote what a god once sang one day i am going to grow wings,5.00,1745
this is a wonderful artrock album radiohead gets more original changing their sound adding more keyboards synths and goofy guitar effects via jonny greenwood a nearperfect album this album did not get a 55 because of how cluttered and chaotic it is thom yorke said that he wanted it to be that way but i never really got into the clutter of the disc i listen to this looking at every track individually,4.50,402
this is one of the greatest albums of all time eclipsed only by the amount of cds they sold radiohead met the boundary between the paranormal and conventional rock band putting things into perspective look at the progression between each album and tell me that they did not have kida and amnesiac in their heads already,4.50,319
in some cases this seems to favor style over substance but usually it has both great album chock full of interesting and affecting music given all the talk about paranoid android and ok computer being references to the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy it is funny that radiohead is band number 42,4.50,295
this album starts out incredibly strong with four fantastic songs but then it starts to falter a little bit even though the second half of the album is mostly pretty good it does not quite measure up to those first four tracks but all in all it is a very good record,4.00,266
wow i will argue this albums merit with anyone who wishes to dispute its quality relevance landmark status beauty etc i am lucky enough to say that this is the first album to save me from the radio before i was fourteen i was not a huge fan of the radio but that was really all that was there for me then one fall when i was fourteen i saw the most bizarre musical performance i had ever seen on saturday night live i did not have an inkling as to who it was but i knew right then i needed to find their music that christmas i bought my father kid a as the song i saw on snl was national anthem and he bought me ok computer this sent me for a loop there i was just stepping through the doorway to the musical world with two fabulously different albums by the same group i love kid a but fell in love with ok computer first first it was airbag then paranoid android then subterranean homesick alien exit music for a film karma police electioneering  i did not know when the music would stop every cd i owned before this had the standard hit or two and the rest was shitty filler but radiohead stood and delivered for an entire album my personal favorites on the album are exit music karma police electioneering climbing up walls and lucky but all the others are strong in their own right to understate my meaning this album is worth a try see for yourself why ok computer tops all of the critics lists,5.00,1400
ok i admit it i just do not get everyone is fascination with radiohead and this album it is the only radiohead album that i own and while it does have the occasional good song it makes me want to kill myself everytime i hear it a little bit of melancholy is a good thing but radiohead is drowning in a sea of depression besides all of the depression the vocalist sounds as if he has taken too many darvocets before stepping into the sound booth to cut the vocal tracks i cannot make out 5 words out of 10 because he slurs so badly good songs airbag subterranean homesick alien let down and karma police the rest of the album is only good for listening while holding a gun in your mouth,2.50,685
besides the fact that in my eyes is the last great rock album i ever heard it is one of the greatest without doubt it is a breaking modern album in which in sense tells were the world is going to depressing and eerie is the melodies in the album the instruments are more electronic than the previous albums the lyrics are incredible well composed tracks arrangements could not been any better radiohead established itself as the last great rock artist in the 20th century,5.00,471
this is a modern classic this is an epic this is genius and is easily the best album of the past ten years radiohead is one of those bands that you either get and love or do not get and hate for those of us that love it there is nothing the haters can say to change our minds ok computer is a great album something that does still exist although seemingly more and more rare all the time highlights include paranoid android a fantastic alternative rock song well thought out and arranged subterranean homesick alien is beautiful who has not wanted to just disappear to a better place karma police is one of the best rock songs ever and worth the price of admission alone electioneering is such a great title and is exactly where the world is at right now bare in mind this song was written eight years ago crazy republicans must hate this one beauty no surprises is another slow startlingly beautiful tune honorable mention to fitter happier you will only ever listen to this once or twice before you start skipping by it because its not really a song but the words are fantastic and pretty much sum up the rules our western society seem to have established over the past 50 years its called population control keep them scared paranoid and thinking they are no good for nothing and they will because no trouble this album makes me feel intensely at that it is like an old friend who you know will be there forever in good times and bad if you like music which requires some thought buy this if you prefer it spoon fed i suggest looking else where,5.00,1547
one of the most daring and creative alternative album of the 90s a lot of people do not understand this album and believe it is irrelevent more of a reason to love it,5.00,166
a well put together cd all in all one of their best,5.00,51
love  them or loathe  them ok computer is one of if not the most important album of the last 10 years thom york and co are modern musical geniuses and this is the peak of their form even other mighty radiohead albums the bends and kid a are no way near as good as this surely one of the best albums of the nineties no dodgy songs no filler absolutely fantastic highlight a heart that is full up like a landfilla job that slowly kills youbruises that will not heal no surprises if i could give it 6 stars i would fantastic,5.00,521
how much better a alternative rock album can be great lyrics great songs the more your hear this album the more you fall in love with it timeless almost all tracks turned to be radiohead classics innovating enough to rate this album already a rock classic and one of the all time greatest rock albums,5.00,300
ok computer is really what i expected radiohead would sound like having bought this album without ever hearing them the first time i played it it just seemed amazing the lyrics are great and also there is really interesting guitar work as are all the other instruments just blend in to make this great wall of sound if you want to discover some real music get this,5.00,364
this album just grows and grows on you radiohead move away from the bends sound which brought them worldwide success and show that they are in fact musicians not just music industry whores paranoid android is fantastic song starts off slow and ends in chaos karma police is superb the whole album is great apart from number 5 which is just a filler tom yorke is using his platform and is pushing rock music in new directions,4.50,424
the mood of the nineties many tried to capture it they succeeded,5.00,64
quite simply one of the greatest albums ever made a feeling that seems to grow every year rather than diminish while  the bends is still a classic in it is own right this brooding album took their music to a whole new level every listen reveals something new hidden underneath the layers from the sound of children playing to microwaves opening and extracts from 1984 fitter happier it is dark yet its beautiful its sad at the world we live in yet the lyrics have hope for the future a masterpiece,5.00,497
out of this world literally this cd will be talked about for decades and decades everything has been said about this album that can be said 10 stars,5.00,148
not exactly my type of music but hey this album is pretty amazing it takes a while to sink in but the beauty of it does show eventually it is a pretty relaxing album that at times makes you feel like you are just floating the best moment the breakslow section of paranoid android wow that is all i can say airbag  45 paranoid android  55 subterranean homesick alien  45 exit music  355 let down  55 karma police  55 fitter happier  no rating electioneering  355 climbing up the walls  35 no surprises  455 lucky  45 tourist  55 just to be clear i rarely rate a song 55 so that emphasizes the greatness of this album in my eyes on top of the songs individually being great the flow of the album is what really takes the sound to majestic heights all around the best album i have yet to hear,5.00,789
on a rather bored afternoon i decided to rearrange my cd rack from worst to best albums this came top along with the beatles  revolver and oasis  what s the story finding radiohead is like finding jesus and i do not think i can some up the genius of the band or this album in words every track valuably contributes to the overall them of the album the music is incredible on an album when the artists are not afraid to use their instruments this album is out of this world and pisses on anything of its kind,5.00,507
just incredible i cannot imagine any album before it or after it that can equal its incredible brilliance and yet still retain a cynical look at the world we live in today the only problem i have with this album is that i am unable to rate it six stars but it deserves every one,5.00,278
alright already an excellent follow up to the bends and a great album in it is own right do not make me say it is not as good as the bends oh i already said that love subterranean homesick alien i want to be on the country lane when the aliens swoop down,4.50,254
no alarms and no surprises that the world had this coming great songs from beggining to end,5.00,91
it regularly surprises me how highly this album is generally regarded by fans and critics alike much of it is really good but i do not think the material is transcendental enough to install ok computer into the annals of the finest popular albums of the modern era besides the bends is the better album,3.50,302
overrated but there is still enough here to make this their best album highlights include the spooky climbing up the walls and their tour de force paranoid android i still say they would be better without the weirdness though,3.50,225
i am not sure how to describe the singualar talent that is radiohead i think if i were to take a stab at it that the modern sensibilites and techniques are almost intimately balanced with thom yorkes epic and smooth vocals creating a symphonic harmony of power and depth ok computer is radioheads masterwork to date it possesses everything an album needs to be great it is quite possibley the best music to come out of the 90s,5.00,426
what an amazing purchase this was i remember getting into radiohead while having an exhausting parttime job during a reasonably warm summer by swedish standards anyway  ok computer really spoke to me then particularly through no surprises and the unbelievably gorgeous subterranean homesick alien and it still does to this very day a musthave as simple as that,5.00,360
i like the bends marginally more having said that ok computer is a real quality album which moves in new directions without sacrificing accessibility the last three tracks make up the strongest end to an album i can think of and paranoid android is rightly praised the panic the vomit,5.00,284
all i want to say is i am glad there are people who think this album is better than the bends you have made me feel a part of something,5.00,135
the best song is climbing up the wallsone of their darkest and most brilliant momentsother standouts include paranoid android exit music let down karma police and electioneeringwhich is probably my second favin fact only the last 2 songs are not that good,4.50,255
no surprises is delicate moving and beautiful after repeated playings i believe it to be the best track on here,4.50,111
although i have to say there are some truly great bands out there radiohead just cannot be beaten this is without doubt the greatest album i have ever heard it mixes all sorts of wondrous styles and sounds together at least one song will appeal to everyone a musical masterpiece beyond possibility,5.00,297
while it is not in my opinion the best album ever like many regard it ok computer is a great record i took it out the other day for the first time in a long while and enjoyed it immensely i had forgotten how much i used to like radiohead most of the songs here are good the only fillers being electioneering a jumbled mess and no surprises very annoying fitter happier should not count as a strike against the album because its an interlude not a real song airbag is a great intro subterreanean homesick alien and let down are two awesome laidback tracks the single karma police and the multipart paranoid android are great i particularly enjoy the climaxes on each raiiiiin down from a great height on pa and the i lost myself section of kp overall my favorite here is definitely exit music for a film  talk about an emotional song unfortunately radiohead lost me after this album maybe someday i will understand their new material,4.00,932
the bends and pablo honey both got very close to this but this is radiohead at there very besti will always remain loyal to these guys but i do not think they will better this,5.00,175
in my opinion radiohead has released a total of three noteworthy albums the bends kid a and the album linking the two ok computer even though i believe that the current radiohead might be creatively spent by now do not let their recent mediocre output discourage you from trying this album yes there does seem to be a bit of filler that you have to be in a specific mood for fitter happier electioneering and no surprises but even that is by no means worthless and when you are in the mood quite enjoyable overall this is an extremely solid album that deserves every one of its 45 stars my favorite songs are the beautiful subterranean homesick alien an etseye view of us earthlings let down and the chilling climbing up the walls the eerie sirenlike noise at the end of that song is no synthesizer in fact it is several violins all slightly out of tune with each other playing in unison it is touches like that that make this album what it is this and the bends will probably have the most mass appeal of radioheads three important albums more so than their experimental masterwork kid a i have kept this review short because i think much of what can be said about ok computer has already been said my final words aredo not mind the filler pick this up anyway,4.50,1260
i am a huge radiohead fan and this probably is not my favorite album but it is the best musically incomparable to any other band that exists to this day and this album sets the standard for any other bands wishing to compete,5.00,224
a very strong 35 stars what brings it down are fitter happier and the tourist the other 10 tracks are all at least pretty good with my two favorites being karma police and lucky,3.50,177
amazingly good stuff except for electioneering and fitter happier which is not a usual song no bad tracks at all this is not the type of music that captures you by the first listening but you can never be bored of it because you find little motives with every more listening must own it it is a shame that radiohead never toured in hungary ,5.00,340
i was of the opinion that the bends would be impossible to match for radiohead but they nearly pulled it off here with a very good record ok computer may have a few dead spots on it i would never suggest fitter happier is symbolic of their best work but the highlights are still just as notable airbag is a very logical and great opener paranoid android a wonderful morphing of what was likely two songs at one point and let down is powerful enough to sap you of energy even on a good day electioneering is a welcome shot of adrenaline and lucky may be the most underrated song in the radiohead catalog the lads might agree with that critical acclaim was heaped on radiohead for this release and for the most part i would say it was wellmerited,5.00,744
this album started my radiohead frenzy and no matter what anyone else says i love it radiohead is constantly pushing the envelope and for that i am grateful in the music of today it is refreshing to go back to 97 and remember the first time i heard paranoid android or saw the infamous music video i am sure radiohead has other albums that people feel are better but ok computer will always be my favorite just because it sticks out in my mind as one of the greatest albums i have ever picked up ,5.00,496
to the fools that call this album ordinary all i can say is go back and take another listen had this album in my car pretty much nonstop for six months to say that you must be a miserable type human to listen to this is crap have a listen to let down if you want a song to pump you up  the buildup is fantastic one of the greats to those who continue to disagreewe hope that you chokethat you chooke,4.50,399
its quite simple one of the 2 best albums released in my lifetime top 5 of all time full fucking stop how anyone can rate this album as 12 star is beyond comprehension but i have a theory i reckon the people that have rated this unquestionable masterpiece as 12 star 1 star etc never got any attention as a child and still do notfrom their parents teachers opposite sex etc and one day as they sat at home listening to oasis followed by coldplay followed by dan fogleberg they hit upon the idea  i know how i will get people to pay attention to what i am saying i will talk complete bollix about a piece of genius work now people all over rateyourmusiccom are talking about my review of ok computer i can go back to grooving to starsailor and steeley dan safe in the knowledge that i got a bit of attention at last its a bit of an outlandish theory but hey i just want someone to listen to me now were did i put that supertramp album,5.00,933
simply a masterpiecethematic beautiful not a weak song well i actually do not enjoy climbing the walls but i would not call it weakarguably the greatest album of arguably the greatest band outside of the beatles or pixies,5.00,221
i saw radiohead in sydney on april 23 2004 they were great but they should have played more tracks off this masterpiece the only album apart from jeff buckleys grace to have 3 of my favourite 20 songs ever on it brilliant the most telling and adequate review of this album that i have ever read is for a minute there i lost myself,5.00,330
i really wish ok computer was a 5 star album for me because i see how it is affected other people and i really do hear the potential for that kind of powerful nearspiritual response but for me the problem is very simple  i think that airbag through to exit music for a film are all really really great pieces of music and then after than there just is not that much to get me excited karma police and the tourist are both pretty decent let down no surprises and lucky are all barely on the good side of passable climbing up the walls for me is only saved by that insane guitar break midway through electioneering just kind of bugs me and usually gets skipped and fitter happier just plain sucks i feel like i must be missing something here because an album does not get rated this highly by this many people for nothing but i have listened to ok computer dozens of times and this seems to be where i have ended up,3.00,913
this is the album that every artist dreams that he or she can put out seeing as there are twohundred other reviews on this site just about everything that needs to be said has probably been said i will throw in my two cents however radioheads third album is still widely considered their best with the perfect blend of their early rocking years evident in such songs as the epic paranoid android or the scathing electioneering and their more obscure later years which can be felt just about everywhere on the album  other especially notable tunes are the orwellian no surprises let down and of course exit music my personal favorite which gradually builds to a climax so powerful that it gives me goosebumps each and every time i hear it more important than the quality of the music on the album is the quality of the atmosphere radiohead manages to take fear and embody it in music on ok computer each song helps to paint a portrait of a world controlled by machines not real machines but humans who have become machines in the world of ok computer no one is happy or content everyone is simply a cog in the larger wheel of government and no ones business is their own business this is even more relevant in these current times where government intrusion into daily life is continually being encouraged and protected and a government composition known as the patriot act remains in direct and blatant contradiction with the the constitution of the united states of america,4.50,1473
this is as you can judge by reading the reviews a loveitorhateit kind of album yes i love it but you should really judge for yourself it can be an album you would love to hate because it is an album that can be a genre itself radiohead combine excellent british songwriting with krautrocklike experimenting and a healthy dose of vagueness in lyric airbag immediately grabs you by the throat with guitar cello and sleigh bells  well if that is not a fascinating combination i do not know what is electioneering is the only track out of place it is a mediocre rocksong that may have fitted well on pablo honey but needs to be skipped on this album after nirvanas nevermind this is the most important album of the 90s yes it is but still you are going to have to judge for yourself because i do know some people who will turn my words around and say that this album is the ugliest turd produced in the 90s my fave track climbing up the walls,4.50,938
peters out pink floydlitestyle somewhere between tracks 11  12 and airbag kind of bores me for some reason maybe out of trying too hard to be epic the rest is a masterpiece do not let any naysayer tell you otherwise although it is easier to listen to if you are in kind of a bummed out mood,4.50,290
easily radioheads best album ever just everything about it is awesome the vocals are astounding its just are very very good album and you do not find many of these anymore i suggest you buy it you will not be dissapointed the best tracks are 2paranoid android 6karma police classic album,5.00,287
the recent reviews of this album astound me personal opinion is obviously subjective and everyone will get something different from this emotional masterpiece  but so say if you want a happy life do not listen to this is utter nonsenseit has emotion and feeling in depth and to me this is not even their best album  kid a gets my vote,4.50,334
jonny what do you know about music go away an carry on listening to westlife come back and talk about this album when you are the right side of 10,5.00,146
this is the 8th wonder of the world this is what dreams sounds like there is nothing like this album it has got the hole thing rock elektronica and beautiful lyrics can it possible be any better than this i do not think so,5.00,222
couple of great songs karma police no surprises etc but fitter happier,3.50,70
very impressed some very good songs what were they thinking with fitter happier,4.50,79
this is a must have cd it is brilliant very well produced if you are getting into radiohead i would say to get this cd first best songs paranoid android karma police electioneering really though all the songs are amazing,5.00,220
how can someone not like radioheads greatest and most achieved album  this is an essential album that everyone should possess the best songs are exit musicfor a film karma police paranoid android and lucky,5.00,205
this is not an album for everyone it certainly has a song for everyone but the mixture of digital and analogue sounds could get hard for some to come to grips with it is a masterpiece of innovation and art in music but like all masterpieces will not appeal to everyone i have spent hours listening to it and do not seem to get tired of it although many reviewers will say it is one of the best albums of all time it does not make that category for me it does however have one of the all time classic songs in karma police there are many albums you should have in your collection in my opinion this is probably one of them,4.50,621
ok computer is one of the only true modern classics it borrows from only the greatest artists and goes in new directions that are both widely accessible and respectably artistic only a very select group of bands in history have ever pulled that off before i would not say that it is one of the ten or twenty best albums ever made some people tend to get a little carried away with their praise however i will say that it is better than about 99 of the music that was released in the past ten or twenty years,5.00,507
picking up from where the bends left off radiohead take rock music to a new or new for modern top40 music level their spin on modern rock is simply breathtaking adding new truth and beauty to pop music radioheads ok computer cannot be described but experienced this is something everyone should listen to in their life,5.00,318
did not like paranoid android when i first heard it perhaps it was people telling me that it was a bohemian rhapsody for the nineties did not even listen to the album for years perhaps it was people telling me that it was a dark side of the moon for the nineties listen queen are queen pink floyd are pink floyd radiohead are radiohead and this album is magnificent,5.00,365
jarmo motherfucker what can i say the bendsas i have said previously do not get much better but this is and as fantastic as the bends is this leaves the bends trailing behind impossible to catch now the first time i heard this album i couldnt be arsed to listen to it more than once a week and it only ever got up to exit musicfor a film before i would turn it off and put the stone roses debut on after all this album was voted the best of all time by q in 98 but why if i want to listen to perfection i will listen to the roses or the bends or so i thought then in qs listend of 02 i had noticed that it had been over taken by nevermind the bends was there at 4 but where did ok computer fall to well it was number 2 but i still couldnt understand how this was supposed to be better than the bends and all my other favorite albums i saw this as the turning point in radioheads career kid a and amnesiac came after and difficult times were begining even though both albums are pure quality it wasent till the 3 weeks after the album poll in q when my bigger more wiser older brother told me listen to it again forget other albums for the 55 minutes or so it lasts and concentrate and i did now i could almost hate brother oasis is not on my hifi half as much as it was the last 10 years this album is taking over it has also change the way i write music lyric wise this album is in my opinion the very best album ever as many wise people say nothing is perfect but they have not listened to this sorry this is not perfect but it is goddamn 999 perfect this album cements thom yorke and jonny greenwood as two of the best musicians the world has ever seen not as commercialy friendly as lennonmcartney but musicly on a par ok computer gave radiohead their deserved place in the elite airbag this song is without a doubt the best start the album could have its air drums sometimes sounding like nothing phil selway could ever do offer the cusion you land on once the electrifiying guitar kick you up the ass and let you fall this song keeps with the tradition of rock music and guitars but yorke seems scared the whole album is truly amazing and any of the tracks can easily go onto a best of album from the malfunctioning paranoid android radioheads bohemian rhapsody through to the terrifiying climbing up the walls and the peach that is lucky if you care about yourself and music buy this 999 perfection,5.00,2405
and here we have it radioheads peak the greatest album of the 90s hands down ok computer is truly a classic album that will never be forgotten right from airbag to the tourist the album is truly remarkable thom yorke putting his soul into his singing and johnny greenwood turning his guitar into a miracle the album never falters for one second even the slightly experimental fitter happier does not disappoint this is an album that every true indie fan needs to own the greatest moment of 1997 and possibly the greatest moment in music history,5.00,544
is there much more that can be said on this album not really so i will keep this short and sweet ok computer whatever you think of radiohead is a triumph of creative vision and musical invention suddenly in 1997 radiohead clearly meant business a brilliant slow motion sonic exploration of modern life that hit a nerve with the world and if not musically then certainly culturally sent ripples through a collective consciousness more effectively than pretty much any guitar record since nevermind a beautiful and sad modern masterpiece,5.00,535
ok computer is the second album i bought by radiohead starting off with airbag with drums especially showing through it offers another great emotionallydetailed album that lives up to what the bends offered it is an almost different sound to the the bends in the best possible way in fact i like it just as much as the bends with the only downfall being on fitter happier a very electronic and robotic song with some varied content and very small instrumental content it makes an excellent transition into the next very different sound of electioneering paranoid android is like a visit to an entirely different world in a sense compared to the first track lyrically strong like all of radioheads songs with one of the most compelling and beautituful synthesizerkeyboard parts that seem to blend in well with the vocals and then set the way forward for the guitar to come back in then a great and sudden jolt into a completely different direction which is not unwelcome which opens up to some furious and good guitar playing then it goes somewhere completely different but poweful in a calming way then back up to before with fury subterranean homesick alien almost sounds like lullaby music with a mix of calming electric almost sealike noises with hints of tropicalness then thom yorke comes in with his equally pleasing lyrics sometimes with an ever so slight harshness alike u2 exit music for a film is all about the vocals at least to begin with together with a very background and almost drowned out guitar building up to a choirlike background which then fades to a very distant sound that is hard to explain with still thom yorke showing through then comes in the drums and the heavy distorted guitar while still ensuring the clarity of the vocals shows through then slightly faded to give the other instruments a chance then faded again showing some final haunting lyrics all the way through let down starts off with a guitar element in it then the drums then the vocals another very easily listenable song it goes into a faded state towards the centre then builds back up again finishing off in a calming way karma police is a song that bears some resemblance to some sounds of the bends it goes places aswell sometimes getting gentler something not electioneering is another the bends sounding song harsh but still great climbing up the walls is a typical ok computer sounding track almost muselike but still quite easy all the same building into a slight ruthless sound at times opening the way for no surprises no surprises was a song a lot of the songs on ok computer all lived up to and did a good job of living up to it is lyrically perfect and is in my favourites list for this album lucky is also a calming trip fairly guitar driven with vocals on top also showing through pretty well ending quite abruptly to make way for the last track tourist tourist has a very gentle guitar beginning with thom yorkes equally gentle vocals being used well here the song goes places but does not rely on extreme but perhaps gradual change to do so full track listing 1 airbag  2 paranoid android  3 subterranean homesick alien  4 exit music for a film  5 let down  6 karma police  7 fitter happier  8 electrioneering  8 climbing up the walls  9 no surprises  10 lucky  11 the tourist  this is a great album just as good if not better than the bends even if you have not got anything by radiohead or do not even like them i highly recommend this album a magnificent show of the abilities of radiohead as a band as well as their emotional and lyrical intensity,5.00,3563
i sort of think this is the 90s darkside of the moon in that it is a perfect timeless album it rocks a lot more than moon does though and is harder to listen to in a lot of ways i think it is more of an artistic accomplishment than darkside but anyways yes easily a 5star album anyone who tells you different is either ignorant or one of those really silly backlash people,5.00,372
2nd of the 3 classic rh albums ok computer offers a fantastic frightening future the songs are amazing rh uses more electronics here than the previous album the bends to startling affect the best songs on the album are the best they have ever done karma police paranoid android exit music the this album is not as tight through and through as the bends or as allengrossing as kid a it is however one of the most interesting and best albums of the 90s or any decade for that manner,5.00,480
this review is one of over a thousand does it really matter what i write is someone really going to single out my ok computer review and say well based on this rating i am going to grab the keys and head to best buy doubtful i think ill utilize this space to review dick continos something for the girls back in the day the ladies would just swoon for a man with an accordion and baby dick is that man even the cover depicts dick with three count them three hep little mamas looking up at dick oh so adoringly this is one record sure to get your special lady friend in the mood for love with fine accordion renditions of twilight time mexicali rose and you are always in my heart let us not forget dicks lovely take on the ole rodgers and hart standard bewitched dick continos something for the girls has a little something for everyone,4.00,836
this is the single best album of the 90s every single track is absolutely perfect and any change to any bar of music would be blasphemous the only track really worth skipping over is fitter happier which is not exactly a song however the track does not really seem to slow the album down at all occasionally it is even worth a listen i would go in depth into all of the tracks but i am sure you have heard everything a hundred times before simply put buy this as if your life depended on it highlights electioneering climbing up the walls let down paranoid android,5.00,564
masterpiece from start to end the music flows the lyrics are deep and sensitive and the band is so tight finally an album where every song sounds different i love it this album won best for 1997 but it gets my vote for the best of the 90s airbag is a great song with standouts from colin greenwood on bass and phil selway on drums they seem to work together throughout the entire song paranoid android is about thoms disgust with the party crowd this song mimics that of happiness is a warm gun by the beatles on the white album it has three different parts weaving through various sounds and time signatures it is an epic song subterranean homesick alien takes its name from the songs by bob dylan subterranean homesick blues from bringing it all back home this songs flows so perfectly after he sings uptight for the third time the music somehow melds its way back to the original beat thom wrote this song after he was driving and he saw a bird fly across his windshield and he thought it was a youfo exit music for a film was written for the film romeo  juliet in 1995 it is about them both killing themselves if you listen to this song really loud it is very haunting especially on headphones once the song kicks in ed is practically tearing off his guitar strings to get the sound you are hearing it all comes back with thom singing we hope that you choke a great way to end a song let down is one of my favorite radiohead songs the way he sings the lyrics is awesome most of the time you cannot decipher what he is saying if you read the lyrics he is talking about the decay of society once he starts singing you know you know where you are with and then he sings one daaaaaaay and the vocals switch from the right ear to leftwow if gives me chills every time karma police is a wonderfully piano driven song with great lyrics phew for a minute there i lost myself fitter happier is said by most to be the worst song on this album even though it is not my favorite it is still a good song it is sort of the gist of the whole album another song with great lyrics electioneering is probably my least favorite still a good song but is overshadowed by the other greats on this album climbing up the wall has a great drum beat and an overall creepy feel no surprises starts off with a xylophone the one thing i love about this song is the structure verse verse verse chorus bridge chorus and then finishes off with another line from out of nowhere such a pretty house an such a pretty garden lucky was written for all the people that died in the plane crash in yoguslavia i think it begins with ed strumming his guitar as close as he can to the frets very cool effect the tourist is a great closer it gives you the effect that the album is coming to a close which radiohead is very good at highlights airbag subterranean homesick alien let down,5.00,2845
almost perfect a paranoid futuristic emotional album,4.00,52
a classic this album is theatrical a genius in it is time,5.00,57
this album really is a great albumprobably their bestit came at the right time i love itand always will however radiohead is good but not amazing as many people are brainwashed to believe critics can say whatever they wantbut radiohead is not notto me of course an amazing bandthey are good and they make good stuffthis happens to be their best to me,5.00,350
truly groundbreaking this album put radiohead on the map if you are a fan of any kind of good music this is a must have this one introduced me to alternative music,4.50,163
this album is pure briliance talent seeking out of its very pores this album can be considered 5 star material because of its effectiveness it brought upon towards the music industry and its listeners there are people out there who do not like radiohead for their dark lyrics and dark lifestyle but i believe that these people do not quite understand how brilliant this work is and how it has changed rock music and lyrics and voice forever this album has been a huge success bringing a huge influence upon music today i think radiohead gets their feelings andor beliefs across more clearly in this album than they do in pablo honey and bends they begin a more wellknown stereotype with this album in that it hit worldwide shattering a huge barrier for radiohead the bends in my beliefs should have started radioheads success and i think it did but not as much so for mostly everyone to realize until the release of ok computer how great of on album pablo honey and the bends are each song on this album rains down upon you each song contains its own feeling some songs are rather spacy dreamy and dark such as sub homesick alien a great song for dreaming to uptight is a great lyrical representation of the feeling that is afflicted upon me through this song a very emotive song in terms of its instrumental display from j greenwood with subterranean homesick alien being my favorite song and following the classic airbag and the long rock out of the instrumental classic paranoid android this album has much more in store after sub homesick alien it leads into another very dreamy and rather dark epic exit music for a film a very distraught and isolated lonely feel is cast upon most listeners in that it is distorted in most areas and the synthesizers and the voice of thom yorke nearly put you to sleep with every listen well next comes let down probably my second favorite although quite hard to say in terms of the whole album containing different feels and different genres each song being extraordinary this song is more emotive and upbeat in terms of instrumental lyrically wise this is probably one of my favs on ok computer the next three songs sort of sink as one for me karma police electioneering and climbing up the walls each three being very different according to genres but very similar through the lyrics and background karma police is a spectacular piano orchestrated hit then with electioneering it turns into a more upbeat phenomenal voice displayed by thom yorke the voice and rhythm of this song are great then with climbing up the walls you are lead into a much more dark chill a song worth chilling to again thoms vocal ability never fails just plain great no suprises a song for me based on a very bittersweet lyrically frozen melody this song is swiftly important dealing with lyrics and is shown within the video words backwards right to left no alarms and no suprises the last two lucky and the tourist seem like a collage turning into one song for me lucky a song very far out with a backed up guitar off on off on off on off on swivvles and ties itself in with thoms vocalreminds me of many pink floyd melodiesno suprises written by jonny a great ending for the album ends with a sort of cashier ding a great album the foundation for fame in music that has been built since led zeppelin and pink floyd a masterpiece and influential piece of brilliance,5.00,3385
most definitely the most pronounced radiohead cd there is to date radioheads perfect sound is most evident on this album and i consider it nothing less than a masterpiece the highlights paranoid android thom yorkes singing at its finest probably my all time favorite radiohead song as well everything is perfect about this song it definitely seems that way it starts with the freshest beat acoustics singing turning into an outofcontrol solo and mesh of other sounds the most amazing part is at the end when the tone of the song switches completely and yorke starts chorusing angel definitely some of the most beautiful vocal work ever karma police this is what you get when you mess with us the lyrics are outstanding and the composition of instruments with the piano has definitely made this piece timeless exit music for a film this song just gets me twisted album rating 90 flawlessly original,4.50,897
i can see why lots of people have got a beef with radiohead thom yorke is a miserable bastard and the rest of the band may as well not even exist he is pretentious and his voice is like the sound you get when you put a megaphone in the microwave all that said i actually liked this album especially airbag although that exit music for a film or whatever it is called is a sack of shit,4.00,384
brilliant building on the affecting songs on the bends ok computer takes music a step further with layers of synth and guitars which manage to take the listener through a variety of emotions while still retaining a definitive sound paranoid android is a bleak cynical commentary on modern life exit music may be the most depressing song ever written but it has intimate beauty and one of the greatest climaxes in any radiohead song let down is suprisingly uplifting with a fantastic harmony in the third verse and climbing up the walls is genuinly scary with a fantastic climax of wailing violins a true masterpiece and while i prefer the bends this may be radioheads definitive album,5.00,684
well since they waited 2 years between ok computer and this album i kind of forgot about the band i did not end up buying this until about a year later because i sort of thought they had their day and wondered what they possibly could have done that was so exciting then i started to see their videos for paranoid android and karma police and i was in love again i even thought that they would improved which is remarkable because i loved ok computer this was far more creative and yet just as pretty and perfect for showcasing their strengths in particular thoms voice airbag climbing up the walls and lucky fast became new favorites and i realized that radiohead really had just taken their time to make the most amazing release possible and for that i am very grateful i am really glad they kept on because i actually think they peaked on this album even though their releases to follow are quite good too this is where it is at,5.00,931
i know a few albums where every song is great but ok computer is the only album i know where there is not even a bad note let alone bad song and i mean that,5.00,156
changes the course of rock music forever a landmark release,5.00,59
i discovered radiohead late in life mtv debuted the paranoid android video ok computer had just been released and the music critics were calling it a masterpiece but i did not know this at the time i just sat on the couch trying to relax after a long day and then it happened a revelation the sounds washed over me sonic pathos carried on thom yorkes expressively sad voice something happened that had not happened in a long time while listening to music i was actually moved tugged in two directions steeped in an emotionally sad narcotic and then shot full of adrenalin too because this music was so goddamn exciting i had been exposed to radiohead before they had received a ton of airplay with the angst ridden anthem creep and less radio play with the touching fake plastic trees and while i loved those songs it was as if i had not really been listening this time though i was incredibly tuned in and as paranoid android assaulted my ears it was as if my music consciousness took an evolutionary leap forward to turn a clich on it is head it was as if my mind imploded my mind turned inward instead of being blown the next day i ran out and purchased ok computer and with utter amazement i listened to an album of music that i felt and still feel is perfection personified not only was every song great but the order of the songs seem so right almost operatic in it is ebb and flow in it is descendo and crescendo ok descendo is not a real word but it should be since that day i have gone back and discovered the other cds and of course delved into the new stuff i find some of it on par with ok computer and some of it not but it is all interesting complex music the wonderful thing about radiohead is that their worst music is still head and shoulders above the normal fare that you hear on the radio,5.00,1808
this is the best album ever by anyone only the beatles come close anyone who says it is not a masterpiece simply has not listened to it enough either that or they are stupid twats let down has the most powerful beautiful climax which i did not think was possible in music before this no surprises is simply sublime one of the most heartfelt beautiful songs ever written paranoid android is an epic and airbag karma police and lucky are ultimate rock anthems the tourist is the perfect ending to a perfect album,5.00,510
yes it is a great album but not quuuuiiiite as great as most people say ok computer builds on the bends in terms of technique and instrumentation but the songwriting just does not match up the level of texture they were able to accomplish with less glossy production on the bends will always impress me more than the smorgasbord of sounds they threw together on this album thom yorke himself called this one a step down from the last this is not to say i am biased toward the bends more traditional rock instrumentation both of these albums pale in comparison to kid a which is even more adventurous truly great music makes you care if you ever hear it again and while i can understand if other people feel that way about this album i seriously think i could live just as easily forgetting that paranoid android or karma police ever existed plus most of the rest of the songs have not aged well and even avoiding them for months at a time fails to renew the feeling they once gave i see this as a transition album when radiohead were just on the verge of bringing out their most sincere expression but still bound by their influences in three years they would break free,4.00,1170
this cd is radioheads greatest followed closely by the bendssome incredible tracks such as lucky paranoid android karma police and oh so many more,5.00,146
this is by far one of the best albums of the last 20 years if at first it does not reach you listen again then do yourself a favor and listen again and if that does not work listen againby the third listen you will start hearing things within the songs you did not notice before and you will find yourself falling in love with the theatrics of exit music or how paranoid android sounds like three songs within one soon enough you will be wondering why it took you so long to notice this album,5.00,492
this album is my all time favorite and its clear why when you listen to it superb all the way from the first crunchy noise on airbag to the last ding on the tourist,5.00,164
when i listen to this incredible album my spine tingles it is like a bird of rearest song has flown into the stereo and sings a psychodelic 90s opera,5.00,149
resistance is futile and in my humble opinion quite dumb the only reason people are targeting this album with their hate is because it is rightly hailed as a masterpiece why cannot they accept that the music they love is not belittled by this small fact there is no secret password just listen to this and you will feel better for it,5.00,333
this album i bought when it first came out basically on a whim at that time i was more into dance music and i had the bends on tape and i loved it but still i was skeptical boy was i wrong this is radiohead at its absolute finest and it has major considerations as the best album of the 1990s with due regard to nirvanas nevermind every song is wonderful and fits in with the rest of the album songwriting this good cannot be ignored and it is not just thom yorke alone it is johnny greenwood and his amazing guitar in paranoid android the landscapes of ed obrian in subterrenean homesick alien and climbing up the walls it has pop songs like karma police and songs that are just statements on its own like fitter happier this album also contains in my opinion and thiers radioheads best song lucky this album deserves the accolades it gets and deserves to be one of the greatest albums of all time it made me a radiohead lover best track  lucky,5.00,945
this is artrock at its best songs like paranoid android is like a pink floyd freakout as well as others like no surprises and let down soothe the mood as thom yorke explores the world of paranoia and dissonance,4.00,210
if you have not listened to this album or any other radiohead album you may well wonder what the fuss is about ok computer is the perfect answer to this a magical album right from the crunching guitar intro at the start of airbag people are in distress planes crash computers speak strange messages and aliens come to earth all this is made scarily possible over the course of these twelve tracks the 7 minute masterpiece paranoid android is a mesh of different songs expertly put together and delivered with perfection the album goes on with style and you can tell the amount of time it took for thom yorke to get the tracklisting just right other standout tracks are karma police a fantastic quirky song let down the beautiful toy guitars and xylophone of no surprises the chilling backrdrop of domestic murder in climbing up the walls the powerful and soaring lucky and  well you get the picture every song stands out you do not listen to this album with a good book you stop what you are doing close your eyes and lose yourself in its majesty fantastic,5.00,1056
alright because kid a is my favorite album have not heard hail to the theif yet ok computer does not do so well compared to it it is almost up to kid a standards by the uniqueness of every song but not in the sense that they are all rock songs and i do not like the wishywashy mood to it with kid a there is a definate mood and ambience to the entire cd everythings anxious and dark and about to explode then in other parts it is so delecate you could crush it between your index finger and thumb however with ok computer you do get parinoid android which is their hit sure but rightfully so that is an epic song there is so many ups downs and musical perfection in that song it is hard to imagine the rest of the record matching it and sometimes surpassing it but it does many songs capture something that parinoid android never did  weakness i have found radiohead thrives on weakness that is why i like most of their songs they sound nutered naked and honest parinoid android is like an 80s cockrock ballad put next to those songs but me saying that really does the song no justice it is a damn good song and cd like everything by radiohead,4.00,1143
this is for sure their best album and the last one i heard hail to the thief is awful amneasic is good and ok computer is perfect,4.50,129
there really is not many this calibre albums around ok computer does really not have a single average track on it otherwise there is a few really classic songs but what makes this album so essential  as is the case with kid a is that all of those 11 songs just moulds together making a perfect combination that the huge talent of the band and a brilliant producing from mr nigel godrich makes ok computer easily a five star record and it is without a doubt one of the best records of decade,5.00,490
ill say i was a little dissapointed the first time i listened to this album i really did not know what it would be like and i was not expecting what i got i have probably listened to it 1000 times since i rewarded myself with this album this music cannot get old and i have not got sick of a single song yet greatest album i have ever heardperiod,5.00,346
this radiohead album will be remembered for a long long time it is just brilliant some songs are just a bit too popish for it to be perfect but it comes close,5.00,158
this record is an aural treat i was coincidentally reading hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and spotted the title to this record importantly for a band that is so serious most of the time there is some good humor here with fitter happier tough to take their politics as the cynicism is overly oppressive but of course that is their point and it fires their art,3.00,359
one of the greatest albums ever there is so much innovation on ok computer from the complex paranoid android to the beautiful karma police even the sequencing of the songs is great the dark chilling climbing up the walls contrasts brilliantly with the more uplifting no suprises fitter happier serves to divide the album in two and while it may not appeal to all it adds to well to the feeling of the album my only complaint is that the last two tracks lucky and the tourist could have been better still few albums come close and this is possibly the most rewarding album i have ever bought,5.00,590
good album but overrated this computer voice stuff was fun on an amiga500 20 years ago,3.50,86
a good album but the bends is much better in my opinion paranoid android has weak lyrics but some of the best guitaring of any radiohead song ever even when compared with just from the bends airbag and the tourist are also top tracks probably the last great radiohead album,4.00,273
second album i own simply the best they created a great album before this i mean the bends it is just great however this one is the best ok computer karma police is such a great song,5.00,182
radioheads third album is a masterpiece is genius lies in its ablility to keep the songs while being progressive far to many ambitious albums loose their focus on the songs over the concept production or progression the opener airbag is mature space rock the first single paranoid android with its compelling structure and voice is one of radioheads best exit music for a film is a focused and haunting tune let down is a standout track with its beatuiful cascade of sound the single kharma police is a simpler piano based tune with amazing emotion impact by the end no surprises and lucky both also singles are amazing songs in which a lesser band could easily wander off on yet radiohead acomplish beautifully the tourist is the affirming final cut and the moral of ok computer slow down idiot ok computer falls bit on cuts like electioneering and climbing up the walls but all in all it is an amazing compliation of songs which in which radiohead kept its songs while progressing something many bands cannot do effectively,4.00,1025
i still prefer the bends but they certainly improved with this album radiohead are a band about great music not chart success,5.00,125
a great album but somewhat overrated imho and not quite up to the standards of the bends,4.00,88
the album of the 90s by some distance well challenged by the bends of course but that aside took a couple of listens to get into and i was not actually all that interested until i saw the paranoid android video on mtv and loved it i just remember the feeling of finding a band who could change and develop and remain utterly compelling to listen to mainly because no matter how the sound changed there were some immovables  thoms voice jonnys guitar and the rockout factor which this song encapsulates perfectly it is been glibly referred to as the bohemian rhapsody of the 90s which is apt but oversimplistic the only resemblance being the collageeffect of both songs moving through a range of different styles within the same song and the fact that both are pieces of total genius of course as soon as i heard the rain down section i knew i wanted this album it takes a couple of listens to grasp the enormity of ok computer but once your brain finds the melodies and harmonies of each song and locks on it is compulsive  you must keep listening to see what they do next q magazine summed it up quite nicely by saying that the first five tracks make up the best opening 20 minutes of album music the reviewer had ever heard good point well put i thought airbag is like a statement of intent then there is paranoid android then subterranean homesick alien exit music incredible and at track 5 the masterpiece let down the final verse with thoms harmonies still frequently reduces me to tears then the singalong karma police has become radioheads anthemic showcloser most notably at glastonbury 2003 where 40000 or so people chanted along in unison and it is a fantastic fantastic song especially the transcendant for a minute there i lost myself lines at the end the best thing about ok computer is that it is an album that makes sense as an album  the songs are ordered in a certain way so as to make sonic rationale as you listen and after the glorious karma police you get fitter happier with its and now for something completely different effect followed by the punky and relatively rather crap electioneering and then the truly aweinspiring sequence of climbing up the walls no surprises and lucky by the time the tourist kicks in you are spent climbing up the walls middle rockout section drives me wild no surprises is a hark back to the beauty of the bends and lucky is earthshatteringly excellent then the tourist pleasantly yet still ultraintensely brings the whole thing to a mindbending conclusion at which point you realise you have heard the future of music ok computer may not have had the explosive impact of nirvanas nevermind but i will confidently assert that the two albums have been equally influential on the subsequent musical scene a whole host of secondrate radiohead emulaters coldplay and muse being two of the better simply would not exist without this record and apart from it is sheer innovation it is an amazing listen radioheads harmonising is extraordinary especially on let down and paranoid android they do dark music like no other contemporary guitar band and they rock their socks off too what more can one possibly ask for for posteritys sake alone please get this album it is depth is apparently infinite i have been listening to it fairly constantly for coming on six years and i still adore it coldplay i can milk for a couple of months perhaps that is the difference between a nice tune and great album my number one desert island disc,5.00,3478
100 perfection and if i did not have this album i would have been a stupid immature kid who likes shitty rnb which is not music anyway so i owe a lot to radiohead and this magnificent album paranoid android is possibly the best song ever made and as for the others like let down and climbing up the walls  they are just legendary songs this 11 track album if you do not include fitter happier is is the greatest album no doubt  then when you listen to it once you think what is this then listen to it a few more times and you will turn it up tto maximum volume doing air guitar  then crying to exit music for a film then singing along to karma police and doing the housework to the delightful lucky buy it now and you will never get a better album for a long time,5.00,763
i have always remained slightly disappointed with ok computer to this day ok computer has been the most widely renowned radiohead album only through the accomplishment of granting heavy public appeal this is what many people think of as radiohead but it remains a decent album at best although the tourist is one of my favorite songs of all time,3.50,345
i acquired this album about a year ago from other reviews i gather this was a fairly innovate album when it came out and gained radiohead a substantial reputation and following i can see why but i have mixed feelings about this offering the good multilayered sound with an original blend of instrumentsnoises used in interesting ways progressive rock stuff for the 90s excellent the bad the lead vocals the lead singer is certainly an acquired taste the diction is poor and without the written lyrics it would be very hard to know exactly what is being sung if there had been a different singer or even no singer i am sure i would have enjoyed this album more and probably given it 45 stars i have a feeling this album would grow on you the more you listened to it i have listened to it right through about 5 times now over the months i have had it and each time i have enjoyed it a little more the vocals still grate though,3.50,924
amazing hardly ever in the history of rock have two albums been followed one after the other each being superb it is really hard to say which is better the bends or radioheads 3rd album ok computer this album is where there genius is really truly noticed they start acting weird and doing it very very well you want to say that ok computer exceeds it is predecessor because of songs like paranoid android and airbag but really the album is not as strong all the way through as the bends is songs like climbing the walls and the tourist are sometimes skipable but ok it really is hard to be hard on a perfect record and that this is radioheads first three records are just great but after this sadly they begin to slouch  trevor ey,5.00,730
exceptional recording the 2nd best album of the nineties behind no code by pearl jam all tracks standout with paranoid andriod and let down being my favorites this album is shades above the ugly kid a album a very sweet listen,5.00,226
oh my god when i first put this disc into the player my jaw literally fucking dropped to the floor up until this album came out all i really knew about radiohead was the creep song and video i figured they would just fallen by the wayside along with so many other bands from the era who knew a little band from england could produce such a stunningly beautiful record karma police let down exit music and all the other songs are just pure genius with the possible exception of fitter happier one of the best albums to come out of the 90s without a doubt a musthave essential listening for any musical diet,4.50,605
i thought the bends could not be topped but this has to be the best recording of it is type i have ever heard bright shining brilliance standout tracks the whole damn thing,5.00,172
well regarded as the best album of the nineties maybe of all time and rightfully so,5.00,83
overrated underrated why not decide for yourself go on give it a try  i reckon it is worthwhile anyway whilst everyone is entitled to an opinion i have to wonder whether those who most criticise this album are commenting on the music itself or taking the blinkered view that only underground music is worthy of their attention and it is impossible to be commercially successful and produce great music those who put aside such petty prejudice and review the music on its own merits or failings do tend to get a lot out of this album  it is undeniably been hugely influential for whatever reason which cannot just be coincidence,4.00,627
this album killed my nightmares thanks to no suprises and paranoid android maybe i am in this world which is probably weird and like it is based on the artwork,4.00,159
yeah so it is a good album but it is nothing amazing and it is nothing that has not been done before it is simply a wellwritten wellcrafted album that stands out as a masterpiece among the rest of the mainstream garbage released in the late 90s but is it a masterpiece hell no is it groundbreaking not in the least radiohead overall is an extremely overrated band they are a bunch of poseurs really all trying their hardest to appeal to the elitist indie kids who are duped into thinking they are listening to the most groundbreaking piece of music since stockhausen came about except they probably have no clue who stockhausen is this is just the vibe i get so do not take offense to it radiohead can thank their success on the countless more groundbreaking electronic and krautrock bands that came long before them can eno neu etc is radiohead doing anything to truly revolutionize music well rolling stone or curt loader may lead you to believe this  but that is what is called hype and hype is what sells radiohead to me are really just a bunch of whiny british guys who take themselves too seriously they really annoy me after a while i must say  especially mr pretentious thom yorke efrim of the band godspeed you black emperor made a good point in an interview from a few years ago around the time kid a was released efrim was asked what he thought about radiohead and their new album he responded by basically saying radiohead are frauds they preach anticapitalism in their music yet they are signed on to a multinational label and are obviously more than willing to mug for every ripoff sellout magazine out there i could not help but agree with efrim somewhat ok computer is one of the best mainstream albums of the 90s and one of the most overated albums ever,4.00,1770
simply their best album play it load and sing along each song is brilliant and tears your heart,5.00,95
just in one word perfect the album kicks off with airbag and after hearing this song you already know what great quality this album has all the songs on the album are highlights but the most highlighted highlights are the before mentioned airbag paranoid android exit music karma police and climbing up the walls it is hard to choose the best song no it is not just hard it is impossible the album is hard to compare with other albums because it is just one in a kind but i can mention some influences such as the smiths comes most forward in songs like karma police and pink floyd just listen to the special effects in climbing up the walls ok computer is the best radiohead album so far and i do not know if they will ever pass this pure work of genius but that is a real challenge for mr yorke and friends,5.00,808
this is radioheads best album beyond a doubt especially on the back of a masterpiece like the bends songs like let down karma police are unique rock tunes,5.00,154
searching for paranoids in mirrors once every decade there happens a year of a breakthrough in music when there are released some very influential albums which define the future of music for the next ten years or so in nineties it was 1997 when such revolutionary albums as attack of the grey lantern by mansun in it for the money by supergrass vanishing point by primal scream ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space by spiritualized radiator by super furry animals and the cream of the crop of course is ok computer by radiohead radiohead with ok computer practically gave birth to the genre which is now known by the name postrock but in fact is a new breed of downbeat and often offbeat progressive rock with heavy use of computer electronics and almost paranoiac psychedelic atmosphere music is complex shifting rhythmically metamorphic and overloaded with melancholia emphasised by tom yorkes sorrowful vocals to the degree that radiohead used to have almost as many haters as their followers we hope that you choke that you choke  so much for the reactionaries who continue to hate this epochal album,5.00,1113
totally engaging and searing in its scope has a low point with that technological voice singing on one song but i will let them off because the rest is an experience to be had,5.00,175
time has put its ruthless finger on this album i bought it on the day it came out and instantly liked paranoid android a track reminiscent of bohemian rhapsody only turned inside out and moving with sheer abysmal force toward its own sonic apocalypse other obviously spectacular tracks are climbing up the walls with a guitardrone so harrowing that even the claustrophobic buoyancy of the song title seems to capsize with negativity and lucky the attempt to cling on to hope so desperately that it crumbles between your hands on the other hand electioneering apparently a leftover freak from the bends is a straightforward outofplace rock tune drowned in and neutered by too much studio polishing and the tourist is just plain boring i would love to hear radiohead record someting really lofi because most of their songs would benefit from a sparser sound furthermore the passionate urge of ok computer has been done simpler and far more convincing on bonnie prince billys masterpiece i see a darkness however the album has undeniably been influential and undeniably not only for the better and radiohead has proven the aptness of their musical skills by constantly challenging themselves and their followers hopefully we will not have to experience coldplay attempt their own kid a and fail miserably,4.00,1301
very good especially paranoid android exit music karma police and climbing up the walls guitar solo on paranoid android is crazy,4.50,128
paranoid android is the best song radiohead had ever written and ok computer is possibly their best album in my opinion before they got too weird and experimental at least for my musical tastes but others might as well disagree i have really triedand still i am trying to give them a chance but  although i respect them a lot probably radioheads music is not my cup of tea as easy as that,4.00,388
a nice collection of moody brooding guitar pop karma police is quite stunning and there are a few other great moments even though some of the songs are kind of weak,3.50,164
after first getting way into kid a i felt kind of disappointed by ok computer i admit i came into radiohead the wrong way without really knowing their history of albums and their development as a band but i found myself kind of bored listening to these songs after experiencing the aural experimentations of kid a i still love karma police and the computerized muttering of fitter happier hints at things to come but overall i like the avantgarde radiohead of kid a and amnesiac much better but that is just me,4.00,510
hey if you are reading my review then you have either just read like 1000 other reviews above mine mine might be on top i cannot really tell yet since i am still writing it or you did not ummm radiohead yea um oh yea ok computer wow this album is one of the few if not the only to be completely original i mean no one has ever heard stuff like this before i do not believe that is a naive statement either because i know there has been stuff that is weird and beautiful but nothing has ever been so influential in the way that it has some of you do not care if its influential i mean hey i do not like everything that was influential but this really is a golden masterpiece golden and thematically mood setting i will even say that if you do not have this cd then your collection is incomplete,5.00,793
this radiohead album never moved me it is too over complicated in nonsence layers of angst that it loses it is appeal quickly for me as does the booklet artwork phyically i dislike alot of the music on here because it is much to loud in an over produced way yorkes voice is as irritating as ever i do not regard him as a good vocal over the soundtrack that radiohead  paints i am not saying this cd is bad by no means any album that gets heaps of praise cannot be bad today in late 2002 ok computer seems like windows 95  inventive but boring it is no dark side of the moon i think oks sales talk for themselves it is all been done before and better but without the gloss,3.00,671
i do not own this it owns me i have more than one copy because i was afraid i would wear out the first and have to be without it i sometimes wonder if i will go in the ground 40 years from now still clutching this cd in my cold dead fingers wow but seriously folks this is the big one do not miss it ,5.00,300
it is just not the bends but it is great i will never understand the point of fitter happier they might as well have called it we want to experiment blatently saying that karma police is their greatest achievement and boy is that saying something,4.00,246
some people call this the greatest record of all time but it is not there are moments of brilliance here songs such as paranoid android and the tourist show that but there are also moments of self indulgence as seen on exit music this is an excellent record but it does not quite match up to its predecessor the bends lighten up boys you are famous now,4.50,352
as great as the individual songs are what makes this album so great is probably its overall darkness a nice blend of sarcasm sadness and fear the dark mood is not set into overkill such as in goth music the bands writing is not implying anything that is outlandish the album simply serves its purpose to cast a questionable shadow over a world that is at best is very questionable,4.50,380
amazing amazing amazing screw the reviews just an album where every song is enjoyable from beginning to end because they do not sound the same no two tracks are alike teh whole album exudes mystery and paranoia i think thom said it best when he described the album as sort of having a camera in the room recording everything that was happeninger something like that each song tells a different story from a different room from one persons perspective in a harrowing reerospect a brief overview 1airbagfear of cars 2paranoidfall of the roman empire we will never know for sure 3exit music a love story 4let down loneliness 5karma police when your concious catches up with you 6 electioneering a letter to the politicians 7fitter happier playing with computers 8climbing up the walls eeerie just scarytry zero 7 mix or frilla brazilla mixquite good as well 9no surprises a lovely tune about disappointment 10the tourist arret every track is sort of pieced together quite perfectly in a sequence that is almost as satisfying as reading a fantastic novel in a day stellar i have no objections about this album i heard it before the presses came and glorified it and i love it to this day listen to the music not the hype,5.00,1216
really challenging album i admit that but giving this three or four chances i can feel the ice is breaking between me and this album first i did not get this at all now i find myself listening some of these songs and actually liking them airbag paranoid android karma police exit music for a film and no surprises are in their own peculiar way very interesting and emotional songs especially karma police almost brings tears to my eyes thom sings with passion and he means every word he says but some of the songs like electioneering lucky and the tourist offers no surprises i do not mean the song and they sound regular and sometimes even boring after all i still like the bends radioheads best album but this is worth listening if you have enough patient this is a challenge to a listener,4.00,791
i am not a radiohead fan the legions of what seems like a radiohead army baffles me my very musicianship has been called into question because of my stance on radiohead three people at work offered to lend me this record in the same week and when i listened to it    i would not doubt this record being one of the top ten rock albums of all time i burned this disc and have since also burned kid a which i think is spectacular and the bends karma police is an intentional direct ripoff of the beatless sexy sadie clever,5.00,519
i really feel like i am getting myself into trouble giving this album 25 stars but every time i listen to it i start to feel physically ill by about track 5 now i am not being metaphorical i am not insulting radioheads music at all on the level i feel ill maybe i will give the chicken kebab a miss next time i plan on listenin to it,2.50,333
a really challenging record that while not as good as the bends is still better than almost anything released in the 90s,5.00,120
take the best album from the smiths stones beatles and floyd they do not come anywhere near ok computer just about as good as it gets,5.00,133
a great radiohead album destined to become a classic,4.50,52
an ok album with one great song but i must say that this is not exactly my kind of fortey,3.50,89
i had to listen to this as i was recommended it and it gets great reviews all of the time well its ok for elevator music pleasant enough but nothing to grab my interest for very long paranoid android is probably my favourite sounds a bit like coldplay to me i must be missing something,2.00,285
i do not think there is objectively such a thing as the best album of all time but there is certainly albums that are regarded as being in a higher echelon of greatness and artistic execution which is a category i believe ok computer deserves to be in absolutely gorgeous and on a personal note my favorite album of all time the bends was a great pop album and radiohead certainly got more experimental on their later releases but this was their perfect moment to me,5.00,466
within my 20 greatest albums of all time let down is the worst song of ok computer but the rest is a set of pure 555 masterpieces every song is memorable and when you hear one of them you cannot forget it lucky is the best of radiohead,5.00,235
