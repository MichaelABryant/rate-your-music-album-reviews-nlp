JaggedJimmyJay,"[""More has been said about Dark Side of the Moon than will ever be necessary, both positive and negative. I see no reason to assess the album's actual music in this review, as my fondness for it is likely rooted in the same reasoning and emotion as most other people who rank it amongst the best albums they've heard. Still, I feel some obligation to explain myself. Many critically acclaimed albums have fallen short of their reputations against my eardrums, and this one is an exception.\n\nWere I asked to describe a perfect hypothetical album, I think my response (were I ever able to come up with a response) would not reflect many characteristics of Dark Side of the Moon. As years have passed and my knowledge of music has expanded, I've learned to appreciate a great deal of sounds and ideas which would have been bothersome to me when this album was dominant over my speakers. My perspective as a music listener has adapted to embrace a variety diverse enough that many of my original favorites now sound dated or tiresome.\n\nDark Side of the Moon is a survivor simply because its impact upon me is defined by more than simple nostalgia. Its sound and structure have served as the very core of most of what I have explored in music. Subconsciously I have contrasted other music against Dark Side of the Moon, unintentionally allowing this album to influence my feelings about other albums. I've grown out of that phase now, but the reverberations are still felt all over my collection. Truly it's not a terribly good effect for an album to have on a listener, but Pink Floyd aren't to be blamed for that.\n\nThis is not my favorite album anymore. I hope though that as I continue to distance myself from it, I don't forget its actual musical merits and importance both to me and to rock music itself.""]",4.50 stars
streetmouse,"['What can I possibly say about an album that not only means so much to so many, and has influenced an equal number ... other then to tell you some personal stories regarding the album, from my perspective, from someone in their early twenties when The Dark Side of the Moon slammed head long into this portion of the galaxy.\n\nI was in Viet Nam when Dark Side was released, and please allow me to assure you, that sitting comfortably in your living room and hearing this piece of music is one thing, sitting in the middle of the jungle, on the other side of the world, on the dark side of the moon, if you will ... now that was an adventure. Viet Nam was black as coal at night, the stars shown down like brilliant beacons, shadows moved from things I couldn’t see, while things moved that didn’t cast shadows, and at times it was so quiet that the noise of the chirping bugs was deafening. This was my introduction to Dark Side of the Moon, and hearing this surreal soundscape mixed with the comings and goings of war added a fourth dimension to each and every song. There were no walls, nothing to contain the music, it just filled up my hootch, floated out through the misquote netting, and drifted off into the jungle, where I’m more than sure that today it’s still resonating from tree to tree.\n\nNow, the coolest thing was when PsyOps got a hold of it. These guys had huge speaker systems that where attached to the choppers, and they would blast the VC with ungodly noise both day and night ... but when we nurses showed up at their hanger with Dark Side Of The Moon in hand, why it took those boys about three minutes to hook the stereo up to those huge speakers, power up the amp, and treated us to a concert style playback in surround sound, that actually shook the walls.\n\nDark Side of the Moon was on the Top 100 for something like a million weeks. It was the seminal album to be used when purchasing stereos, speakers and using dope. There were a certain number of albums one simply had to own, otherwise you hung your head in shame, and Dark Side was at the top of the list. Dark Side was playing all of the time, but that was back when Rolling Stone Magazine was counter culture, filled with stereo adds, mail order bongs, and those uncomfortable Earth Shoes. Just the words Dark Side and Pink Floyd were dropped to let people know that you were hip, with the poster from the first edition hung prominently in everyone’s living room.\n\nThe music from Dark Side has stood the test of time astonishingly well, though for me, not the trippy cash registers, the screaming or the bells. I have taken the album to a friend who has mixed out all of those annoying sounds, leaving me with one of the smoothest, lush and flowing albums I could ever have conjure into being. There is no way to measure all of the groups who would reference Dark Side as the seminal release that spurred them on, and it certainly must be considered as a historical release, giving the album a central place in musical history.\n\nEverything Pink Floyd ever did lead them to the making Dark Side Of The Moon, and everything they did after was a mere reflection of it. I’m sure that one day people will wonder what all the hoopla was about, but by then I won’t care ... I’ll just shrug my shoulders knowing that The Dark Side Of The Moon effected everything I have ever done or thought.']",5.00 stars
resist_retreat,"['You know, for a band that spent several albums trying to atone for unceremoniously ousting its founder when his incredibly fertile mind became just that little bit overheated from LSD use, Pink Floyd seems to have spent forever never reaching the heights it promised when Syd Barrett was still a member. And as if to add insult to injury, their atonement made the respective members wealthy beyond all measure, like those artists who make more money on the back of their appearance at charity gigs than the charities can ever hope to raise.\n\nNow, I don\'t care how many gazillion copies this album has sold, or how mind-blowing it may have been to university students back in 1973. What I can say with some confidence is that Syd Barrett at no point in his erratic career - even at his most bizarrely addled - ever made anything quite so useless as this. The sheer irony of this record - which after all has lunacy as one of its main themes - is that I pass by people everyday who habitually mix medication with copious amounts of alcohol, who are both more entertaining and speak a great deal more sense than Pink Floyd do on this album.\n\nOf course in theory the album sounds pretty grand. The problem with it all is that the theory is that much better than the finished product. It\'s that whole progressive rock problem in a nutshell. Once you\'ve demonstrated your prowess as a musician and toiled endless hours to precision engineer a snippet of a sound effect, exactly what are you saying? I imagine, without much fear of contradiction, that whatever the members of Pink Floyd are saying on Dark Side of the Moon, it is not what I am hearing. In ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", for instance, what I hear is Clare Torry\'s vocal gyrations appearing in a desperate attempt to signify soul where there is none, which only makes the song that much more incongruous.\n\nThere are but two tracks here that enliven proceedings to any great extent, but those two also have serious flaws. The best known track is of course ""Money"", built around a cash-register tape loop - perhaps the most entertaining idea on the LP. I\'m not sure how much Pink Floyd was good for when it made the song, but its jaundiced look at the downside of riches is belied by its being as effortlessly radio friendly as Pink Floyd have ever been. That its message has frequently been lost on the uninitiated listener is also testament to the band\'s inability to adequately signpost the depths of its irony, which in turn speaks volumes about the dour, humourless vacuum Pink Floyd albums tend to inhabit.\n\nPerhaps nowhere is this last point more obvious than on ""Brain Damage"". It refers specifically to Syd Barrett, and is perhaps the track on Dark Side that comes closest in spirit to Barrett\'s own work - but not that close. Where Barrett\'s creativity was always playful, even when it was at its least cohesive, ""Brain Damage"" makes use of heavy-handed metaphor and appeals to most of the conventions of sentimentality in rock music. This doesn\'t make it a bad song, just a song which is light years away from ""the dark side of the moon"", being as hopelessly conventional in style as those who would ""keep the loonies on the path"".\n\nIt is telling that the generation that grew up with this LP is for the most part in its late fifties today. I fully accept that Pink Floyd intended to challenge the status quo, following the countercultural path they embarked on in the late 1960\'s. Yet in the midst of their slightly sombre weight-of-the-world-on-our-shoulders mannerisms, one can, with the benefit of hindsight, trace its target audience in our day weighed down by their own obsession with house prices and traffic jams. Just as a song about the negative side effects of wealth was instrumental in making the members of Pink Floyd extremely wealthy men, so a whole album seemingly questioning the sanity of established values sold to a generation that pretty much sold its countercultural soul for a slice of Thatcher\'s property owning democracy.\n\nNow that\'s what I call lunacy.']",2.00 stars

It\'s never too late for you and an album, kids.\n\n(That\'s entirely too glib, so let me expand on that: Dark Side of the Moon, as my father\'s favourite album of all time, has been part of my life for literally as long as I\'ve been aware of the existence of music, and I\'ve always loved the first five tracks, liked the next two, and really disliked the last three; they\'ve always been a sticking point when I\'ve listened to it in the past and have always prevented me from truly loving this album, particularly when Wish You Were Here and The Wall exist. On further reflection now, ""Any Colour You Like"" and ""Eclipse"" are both perfectly enjoyable despite being a little on the inconsequential side compared to what goes before them, and it turns out it\'s only the verses of ""Brain Damage"" that I really dislike - I might well skipped this song as much as any over my lifetime, with that first \'the lunatic is on the grass\' sparking a Pavlovian response to jump up and put something else on even now, but forcing myself to listen to it reveals that the choruses are actually pretty great, far moreso than I\'d remembered. ""Us and Them"" is also considerably better than I remember it being; a song I\'d once considered the beginning of the end for the album now feels like one of the highlights of the whole record, perhaps second only to ""Time"". So yes, after all those years, I finally love this, as desperately uncool as it has become to admit to that around these parts.)']",4.00 stars

poemzx,"[""An incredibly thought provoking and beautiful album which forces the close listener to reflect on how they run their life. Whats good whats bad and what should and should not be important. An album that can honestly change your perception on just about everything. One that can be deeply personal, as it focuses on the individual and their daily struggle to accept the things that they cannot change, but to also never forget what is truly important to their unique being. And one that speaks about the individuals inherent need for society even with its plethora of problems it present to the individual. The Yin and the Yang.\n\nEdit: Nonetheless this album is extremely overrated and over hyped; and by no means perfect.

Pyramidstation,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""See all those fives? There's a reason they're there. The Dark Side of the Moon is the greatest album of all time. You may have a favorite album over this one and that's alright, you may believe there is a better album out there and that is fine too, but the reality is that this is the greatest album of all time. There now that I got all that pretentiousness out of the way we can proceed.\n\nCrimson King may have introduced the world to Progressive Rock but Pink Floyd perfected it with this album. The Dark Side of the Moon is one of the most memorable recordings in history both in terms of production and music composition. This is Pink Floyd high on musical integrity not shrooms. They reached maturity with this record, showing their fanbase and themselves that they understood the hardships of life. Love, Madness, Money, Time, and the entire human spectrum is present in this monumental achievement.\n\nThe album introduces you to the first sign of life, your heart-beat. Speak to Me makes use of every sound effect present in the album. The madness and screams make way to the album's iconic groundbreaking composition.\n\nBreathe, the song built out of King Miles' opus lays down the groundwork for the album's structural composition. The pitch bends, reverberation, and the way Mason makes love to his drum-set can be summed up with one word: perfection.\n\nOn the Run puts the prog in progressive rock. Gilmour's and Waters' curiosity led them to compose one of the most important proto-electronic rock composition. A simple arpeggio pattern sped up to create a sound equivalent to anxiety. This is spiced up by the airport announcer, airplane sounds, and road managers laughing. Oh, also a crash.\n\nTime is the most sophisticated composition in the record. Classic rock is present with the guitar solo, progressive rock is present with the use of special effects and reprises. The album's concept is also summed up in the lyrics leading up to the guitar solo. Life can catch up to you and when it does be ready for the shit-storm.\n\nThe classic one-take by Clare Torry is the most memorable moment in The Great Gig in the Sky, however more credit has to be given to Richard Wright and the mastery of his craft for creating (using the recurring melody) some damn powerful chords.\n\nMoney, the forced single of the record, achived what it set out to become; a money maker. The album summarizes the lives and personalities of the high class. It also includes one of the best saxophone solo present in Pink Floyd's Discography. Dick Perry is a hell of a saxophonist.\n\nUs and Them is the heaviest of songs in the album. The sophisticated production behind the track only serves to help send the listener into a state of bliss. The Violent Sequence remains with Gilmour singing about the dark aspects present in humanity. For wanting the price of tea and a slice the old man died.\n\nAny Colour You Like is my favorite composition. It has been since I first started listening to music and it will probably be my favorite long after I die. The reason why I have fallen in monogamic love with this tune is due to its perfection. The production behind it is unmatchable by any standard, the synthesizers take front row for most of the production, and the guitar/bass/drum combo serve as a base. In my mind this is what a song should try to achieve if it wants to be perfect.\n\nI don't know how many times I have cried to the synth solo in Brain Damage but I do know that I will always look back at this piece as the music embodiment of nostalgia. The lyrics take in spirit the view of a madman in an asylum. It also serves as a transition to one of the greatest endings in the history of music.\n\nTalk about an amazing way to close an album. Eclipse fittingly closes the album with an epic mixture of jazz organ roars, chorus shouts, lyrics summarizing the concept, and the one sustaining product of life. The beating of the heart.\n\nThere is no dark side in the moon, really. As a matter of fact it's all dark. You can have it any colour you like though.""]",5.00 stars
JonFox,"[""The original vinyl pressing of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon was released in America on March 1, 1973, with the U.K. distribution following three weeks later. The ambitious concept album topped the Billboard album chart for one week, going number one on April 28th of '73.\n\nDespite the fact that The Dark Side of the Moon was limited to one lonely week at the peak of the Billboard LP chart, the album's legacy is confirmed by the incredible staying-power that the inspired recording commanded.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was issued as the final quarter of my Freshman year of high school was underway. In a monumental year of album releases, that included Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, Alice Cooper's Billion Dollar Babies and the double-LP Quadrophenia by The Who, there was no shortage of era-defining rock recordings for long hair teens cruisin' 'n' boozin' action.\n\nOnce The Dark Side of the Moon hit the Billboard chart, the album went on to spend a mind-numbing 741 consecutive weeks in the top 200. Throughout my high school and college daze, and into my early years of career resume-building, The Dark Side of the Moon was a constant on the Billboard chart.\n\nRemastered in 1992, the compact disc release of The Dark Side of the Moon is no competition for the original LP, which featured a pair of foldout posters that were a dorm room staple during the high times '70s.

HipHopHead5,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'First of all, this album is NOT as good as Wish You Were Here. That album is currently my favorite rock album, where as this one is not. However, I do believe that this album is a classic. Even though it was proceeded by an album that surpasses it in every way, it\'s an amazing album in its own right. From beginning to end, this album proves itself to be worthy of (most of) its praise. The first song starts the album off excellently. It\'s not really a ""song"", more of an interlude, but it sets the tone for the album and it\'s a great, effective intro. Then, ""Breathe"", one of the best songs on the album, kicks in. That song is perfection and is a pretty good illustration of why I love Pink Floyd. ""On the Run"" is my least favorite track on the album, but it\'s cool nevertheless. ""Time"" is one of the strongest songs on the album, despite the slow start and it leads into ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", a song that\'s so amazing that I would give it 6 stars if I could, which leads into ""Money"", another all time classic rock song. ""Us and Them"" is very mellow and is a great song, ""Any Colour You Like"" is one of the more experimental songs on the album and it\'s a great song, ""Brain Damage"" is yet another great song, and ""Eclipse"" is...no surprise...another great song and it\'s also the perfect way to end the album. Really, the only drop in quality is ""On the Run"", which is still a good song, is sandwiched in between two of the best songs on the album, and is at the beginning of the album, making it ""forgivable"" (as if a song that\'s good needs to be forgiven). I\'ve neglected to mention that this album is a concept album. I don\'t know what the word for word description of the concept is, but it doesn\'t matter to me because I just ignore the concept anyway. In my opinion, it\'s not important to the album (I didn\'t even know it was a concept album when I first listened to it and it didn\'t affect my enjoyment at all). I would be lying if I said that this album is perfect. A lot of the songs are missing that certain"" x factor"" that would make me give them 5 stars. That is not, however, a flaw with this album; it\'s more of a reason for me to not give it 5 stars. I almost never give non-hip hop albums 5 stars, so that isn\'t even a slight jab at this album. It\'s an amazing album, a rock classic, and one that I\'ll continue to come back to time and time again. It\'s not as good as Wish You Were Here, but very few albums of any genre are, so whatever. If you have any interest in rock at all, this album is essential.\n\n\nRating: 4.5/5']",4.50 stars

LimedIBagels,"['1. This is a great album.\n\n2. I don\'t really like this album.\n\n3. This is a popular and revered album because millions of people feel, implicitly and/or explicitly, that it\'s some of the most precisely and overtly atmospheric music ever recorded; music you can wander around and get lost in. These millions are not wrong.\n\n4. If any rock(-ish) album ever screamed out \'LISTEN FROM START TO FINISH!!!\', it\'s this one. The whole thing might as well\'ve been linked as one long track (or two, in the vinyl era), though I of course understand the desire to commercially distinguish the three or four actual songs. Either you take the record from start to finish, or there\'s not much point bothering in the first place — deal with it. Like other blatantly holistic rock albums like Tommy and Fragile, the good songs sound infinitely better in context, framed and paced accordingly. Every time I hear ""Time"" or ""Money"" on the radio, I get why they\'re playing, but I still can\'t help but think, \'You\'re doing it wrong, assholes!\'\n\n5. Come to think of it, Dark Side of the Moon is actually a lot like Fragile. Not aesthetically, but in spirit: both albums don\'t really announce themselves as \'concept albums\' in the traditional sense, but we kind of take \'em that way anyway. Also, you can hear samples in both records - stereo-panned, in Dark Side\'s case - of running footsteps, which intensifies the recurring feeling that you\'re running. Except where Fragile feels like you\'re running to something, constantly, Dark Side of the Moon feels like you\'re running away from something, intermittently. Complete with long glides over the skylines and out into space.\n\n6. The first two minutes of ""Time"" are like watching irregular raindrops burst with huge sonic booms in tepid Amazonian tide pools.\n\n7. Roger Waters was always Pink Floyd\'s MVP. Yeah, Gilmour was purtier (guitar-wise) and friendlier (voice-wise), but Waters was the only one in that group (in their \'70s heyday) who knew how to write, y\'know, songs; pieces with some sort of approximation of a beating heart behind them. True, the guy\'s cynicism (\'You missed the starting gun\') and dumbass sophistry (\'All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be\') were already starting to get preachy and intrusive by \'73, and he just got more obnoxious and empty-headed as the decade wore on — a tiresome thing to witness from a guy who isn\'t nearly as smart as he thinks he is. But unlike ""Welcome to the Machine"" or ""Have a Cigar"" or The Wall, the music here - at its most engaging - actually subsumes the deluded grandeur and simply guides you along; Waters might as well be singing nonsense in ""Us and Them"", because the focus of the track is on its spacious, jazzy drift. (Although \'with...without\' does nicely and (perhaps, probably) unintentionally recall the similar \'Leave...don\'t leave me\' from ""Breathe In the Air"".) Also, let\'s face it: led by Gilmour, Floyd would\'ve sounded like just another lame-ass, wanky, completely dated arena group by the late \'70s. And whether the hipsters-in-denial who use phrases like \'dad rock\' wanna admit it or not, Floyd\'s atmospherics were, indeed, better than that. Bonus: unlike The Wall, Rog still generally knows when he should just shut the fuck up.\n\n8. Fun fact I just found out the other day: the guy doing all that hysterical laughter throughout the album is Floyd\'s road manager, who (before dying of a drug overdose) fathered one Naomi Watts.\n\n9. The moment when the bass line first starts feeling out its riff over the monotonous, slavish gear of the cash register in ""Money"" is a tremendously, slyly thrilling moment in rock music. The musicality feels so close at that moment, so in-the-instant, that it\'s like someone behind the counter of a bank just snapped and started playing a bass in the middle of their shift. And soon, what with that flanged guitar and moon-dappled keyboard, everyone else has joined in and hit the streets. Cool time signature, too.\n\n10. As with a lot of great, ambitious albums in the \'70s, the second side meanders. ""Money"" is about a minute or two longer than it needed to be (the sax solo ain\'t much, and for all its pumped-up tone Gilmour\'s own solo sounds, melodically, like he was just woken up and told to play something — he just wanks around a bunch of bluesy nothings), Gilmour\'s attempt at funk riffage in the back half of ""Any Colour You Like"" is misguided, and the two similar actual-songs that bring the album out, good as they are, really aren\'t paced or precluded well — the album just kinda jolts you out of those gorgeous organ tones like the band realized they have to wrap up the album, and figured they\'d better throw in a couple of actual tunes. And the entire side really piles on the catharses; not enough of the peaks are thrown into fitting relief.\n\n11. Side one, by contrast, is paced perfectly. The rising heartbeat and panning vocal samples of ""Speak to Me"" build up the kind of tension that comes from a paranoid and industrial grind; building, building, building, and then......release. Air. You\'re let in, passing through the looking glass to a new plane of experience and/or realization. ""Breathe In the Air"" is so fuckin\' sonically immersive - and so colorfully, effortlessly so - that every time I hear it I get the feeling that those slide guitars could be orchestral strings and it wouldn\'t even feel like it mattered. (\'Breathe...breathe in the air...don\'t be afraid to care...\' is practically the mantra of the entire album...at its best.) Similarly, ""Time"" takes its (ahem) time building up its own tension with those stereo-panning drum clatters and spare booms of guitar, so that its drum fill and big entrance are earned, not forced. ""On the Run"" was wisely left as an instrumental, using a sped-up organ figure to drive and motivate a very urgent and paranoid soundscape: helicopter blades descending; panning spoken voices starting out sullen or benign and panging aside in sharp primal screams; muffled announcements running methodically over a PA system in a crowded terminal...the whole track feels like you\'re tripping in a train station, or like you\'ve just realized that you\'re the only conscious individual left in a dystopic android future, and you have to get out of this place right now. (Bet Coppola listened to ""On the Run"" while making The Conversation — that constantly-looking-over-your-shoulder fearfulness goes well with Cold War paranoia.) And though Clare Torry\'s vocals in ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" are obviously more of an improvised soul-purging than a carefully-executed performance, her wander-yearnings are the perfect ascension, the perfect catharsis out of side one, especially after the slow intensity of ""Time"" (whose close, angular, crunch-funk guitar fills sound almost post-punky). And around the 3:00 mark, Torry does settle on some conventional beauty. Which makes up for the cheesy piano.\n\n12. The keyboard tones in the first minute of ""Any Colour You Like"" are lush green bubbles, immersing and releasing you into the night with equal auras of benevolence and concern.\n\n13. The guitar solo in ""Time"" is the one Pink Floyd \'moment\' that I find truly, beautifully emotionally overwhelming; the band\'s one \'moment\' capable of snapping my soul in two. Melodically, the solo isn\'t anything particularly special for the first little while, but as a piece of - if you will - atmospheric catharsis, it\'s brilliant. The moment that gets me, though, is...well hell, you probably already know what it is. That part when the choir comes in, around the 4:14 mark? Yeah, you know the part.\n\nFriends with their backs to you watch from a hillside as silent chains of lightning ripple across the sky and flaming streams of neon hair flicker away in static spasms. Rainstorms roll in to meet dire land.\n\n14. The danger in this album is, for the most part, staged as an introversion. It\'s in your own head. Musically, in spite of Rog\'s aforementioned dumbass sophistry and cynicism, the danger can be subverted, and the trajectory of the album continually suggests that it will be.\n\n15. This is, hands down, the single most overrated album of all time. (Give OK Computer a couple decades — it\'ll catch up.)\n\nA.']",

That is the spot where Dark Side of the Moon plays. I visited Glen Helen weekly through most of my teen years. It didn't matter day of the week, time of year, day or night. Dark Side was always playing loudly into this little patch of forest. But, if you drove on that same stretch of road, with the windows down to listen for it, it wasn't there. This went on for years, and though I haven't been back to Glen Helen for several years, and have heard that the university has since closed, I can only imagine that Dark Side still plays there, uninterrupted, and will continue to do so forever.""]",
yerblues,"['While The Dark Side of the Moon is a masterfully produced album (thanks in part to the sound engineering of Alan Parsons), it\'s never really made much of an impression on me. The individual songs are more like sketches, with only ""Time"" and ""Us and Them"" featuring any real development. ""Money,"" the album\'s ostensible hit, is just corny, its jazz-fusion style (and supposedly noteworthy 7/4 time signature) completely undercutting its anti-capitalistic lyric. Because the album insists on stitching each track together, they end up being breezier than they should be, completely neutering the ""dark"" musical elements on the record (which only manifest themselves in the throwaway segue ""On the Run"" and the album\'s best cut, ""Time""). Furthermore, the attempts to parody gospel and soul music in ""Any Colour You Like,"" ""Brain Damage,"" and ""Eclipse"" are stilted and goofy, compromising the album\'s ""spacey"" qualities. While it is impressive that the one-time sodden act, mired in the post-1960s psychedelic rock ghetto, managed to synthesize their approaches (and musical breadth) into an album as accessible (and commercially successful) as this one, it lacks the focus of its follow-up, Wish You Were Here, or the sonic adventurousness of earlier efforts The Piper at the Gates of Dawn or Meddle.']",3.00 stars
Warthur,"['The genius of The Dark Side of the Moon lies in one important fact: that whilst the rest of the progressive rock world was pushing as hard as it could for more complexity, more time signatures, longer songs and more obscure lyrics, the Floyd decided to take precisely the opposite approach. They didn\'t abandon complexity or experimentalism or prog completely, of course - the album\'s a 40-minute suite about madness replete with synthesisers, for goodness\' sake - but they were careful to incorporate no more complexity than what a song strictly needed, and likewise Roger Waters made sure the lyrics were more direct and less abstract than, say, your average Yes composition - with the result that they had more force.\n\nAt a time when prog for prog\'s sake was a tempting proposition, Pink Floyd moved away from that, and therefore managed to avoid most of the backlash later in the decade, Johnny Rotten\'s ""I Hate Pink Floyd"" shirt notwithstanding. The result was the band\'s best album since their debut, and a definitive end to their post-Syd slump. What more is there to say?']",5.00 stars

onemarathon,"['I am trying my best not to select and gush over the most obvious albums, but why not just say for the billionth time that this must be the greatest rock album of all time? I love Dark Side of the Moon just as much - or more - today as I did when I first discovered it back in the 70s. Sure, some purists like to claim it\'s the more spontaneous recordings that capture a moment of inspiration, but if you had the time and money - and patience - wouldn\'t you rather refine that baby until it\'s as close to perfection as possible? Some might not, instead seeking a raw, urgent sound and vibe. But the guys in Pink Floyd were at the top of their game in \'73, with a very different goal in mind, so they went the other way. Overkill? Not a chance. Dark Side of the Moon rocks and rolls and chills and souls. Does that make any sense? Who cares - it seems to sum up this recording sufficiently.\n\nIf reliance on electronics and tape effects can heighten the experience, send chills down the spine, and engage the brain (without any mind-altering substances, I might add), then why argue with it? Floyd, as masters of their instruments and writing progressive music, and pioneers of new recording technologies, did not goof around. They sought out the best in the biz to aid them in their aim to make history (but did they really know that they would?), recruiting engineering wiz Alan Parsons, saxophonist Dick Parry, guest vocalist Clare Torry, and a quartet of backup singers that made Dark Side stand out in the Pink Floyd canon.\n\nSome of the music, like the single Money (""it\'s a hit""), was originally written with a stripped-down bluesy approach. But electrified and performed by one of the tightest acts around, the track blisters and stings both lyrically and instrumentally. Just listen to the whole album from start to finish. That is the only way to properly appreciate all the work that went into this masterpiece. And for critics of the album, well, how do you explain a disc that held a spot on the charts for fifteen years? Right. ""... thought I\'d something more to say"".']",5.00 stars

I feel like Dark Side of the Moon might be a lot of people\'s first exposure to Pink Floyd, it actually wasn\'t mine (that honor goes to The Division Bell), but it is definitely my favorite so far. When I try to put into words what I love about the music here my words tend to fail me, and for anyone that knows me, not only is that a rare occurrence, but a revealing one. Spellbound. There we go, my mind is coming back to me.\n\nWhat\'s not to love here? From the nearly ethereal quality found in The Great Gig in the Sky and Us and Them, to the jazzy beat in Money, to the continual and overarching theme of introspection and examination of the human experience -- heartbeat to heartbeat, birth to death, and the gamut of emotion and experience and mental states in between. How could you not savor every minute of this music? In short, I could listen to this album every day for weeks and never get bored. I notice something new every time I listen and that\'s what keeps me coming back, that\'s what I like about it. It is both a favorite and comforting listen while, at the same time, offering a chance for growth if you care to see and hear.

But these live versions often didn\'t come close to the final product, and when it finally arrived, I was mesmerized.

Finally, a PF album with production worthy of it\'s content. But I guess in this case, my taste proved not so ""underground"", as the mainstream latched onto this record and never let go. It went straight to number 1, where it remained entrenched for over 80 consecutive weeks, a record that remained unbroken for many, many years (may still be unbroken, for all I know!).

nathanten,"['One of the most unlikely of mega-hits and a record that Rob Sheffield calls it the ""most hip-hop of all classics"". There\'s no doubting that in terms of endurance (it spent 11 years on the charts after all), The Dark Side of the Moon is something of a classic. It\'s also gorgeous, astonishing, time-consuming, dull, and lyrically simplistic. But what sounds they conjured up! David Gilmour\'s guitar break on ""Time""-one of the finest ever recorded-sounds like the heavens opening up. And ""Us and Them"" is a lunar, nearly Buddhist meditation on the futility and greed of warfare. It\'s a lament of battle as viewed through the cloudtops. ""Money"" is a musical knock-out that also showcases the square, glib cynicism that would come to define the group by the decade\'s end. This Kubrickian album probably has more patience with itself than you do with it, which isn\'t a crime. Dark Side misses greatness by forgetting that concept and cohesion and flow need an engine to chug it along. The ponderous atmosphere and vibe feels self-indulgent and occasionally lethargic.

The working title for this album was \'Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics\', mirroring Roger Waters idea that the songs should deal with things that ""make people mad"": war, anger, isolation, greed, regret, aging, death and mental illness. And madness pervades the songs, played as continuous pieces of music on both sides of the album. Of particular note is the clever interplay between the songs and the accompanying background dialogue that runs throughout -- sometimes mumbled, sometimes drunken, and other times forthright -- culminating in the final ironic statement: ""There is no dark side of the moon, really; as a matter of fact, It\'s all dark.""\n\nAlong with \'Sgt.

Il est assez difficile de se défaire du contexte. Ne serait-ce que la pochette, que je reconnaissais déjà à un âge où je ne savais même pas que Pink Floyd était un groupe de rock.\n\nCette notoriété immense peut avoir un effet à double tranchant. S\'il est pour beaucoup la porte d\'entrée dans la musique 70ies, que ce soit progressive, psychédélique, space ou autre, Pink Floyd fait aussi (malheureusement) figure d\'arbre qui cache la forêt. Et dès lors on n\'arrête pas d\'entendre ""Dark Side of the Moon c\'est le plus grand disque du monde"" ou alors ""personne n\'a jamais rien fait d\'aussi planant"" dans la bouche de gens qui n\'ont jamais rien écouté d\'autre dans le même style.

bron31,"['Flawless sound, imaginative arrangements and production, and classy songwriting all add up to a classic record. After a few years in a relative wilderness following the departure of founding member Syd Barrett in 1968, struggling to find their niche over the course of a full-length LP, Pink Floyd found their feet and then some on 1973\'s _Dark Side of the Moon_, which at the time was a fashionable concept album. These days, it\'s a less-fashionable concept album (the very word conjures up visions of some overblown prog-rock nightmare), but almost four decades on remains a high point in the band\'s creativity.\n\nIt was the epic ""Echoes"" on 1971\'s _Meddle_ that finally clicked things into place for Pink Floyd, and their soundtrack work on _Obscured By Clouds_ was the perfect lubrication for tackling a concept record such as this. Much is made of David Gilmour and Roger Waters, but the unsung hero here is Richard Wright, whose keyboard and synth work defines the sound along with Gilmour\'s beautiful guitar work and the crystalline vocal harmonies.\n\nIt\'s a surprisingly diverse record, with classic soft rock songs like the summery ""Breathe"" and the wonderfully jazzy and inventive ""Money"" nestling alongside squiggling synth experiments (""On the Run""), hazy epics (""Us and Them""), and songs of gospel, orgasmic intensity (""The Great Gig In The Sky."") The latter particularly is a shining light on _Dark Side of the Moon_, with Wright\'s evocative piano lines providing the perfect jumping-off point for session vocalist Clare Torry\'s soaring, improvised vocals. The effect is riveting, primal, sexual. And the pace doesn\'t let up either. While the other songs don\'t aim for the same white-hot intensity, the production and arrangements are incredibly sophisticated and tight across the board.\n\nCohesive, melodic, and aurally interesting, _Dark Side of the Moon_ has earned its status as one of rock\'s premier recordings. It\'s hugely influential but more than that it\'s often hugely entertaining. It\'s one prog rock concept album that is thoroughly listenable and accessible and can be enjoyed by all - certainly not one to be intimidated by or to send you running to the hills. Attractive and inventive, it started a run of classic Floyd records over the next six or seven years as they really hit their stride and entered their purple patch.

The main focus of the album is a view of life and death taught through an array of sound with beautiful yet depressing lyrics.\n\nDesign: The songs on either side of the album lead into each other, the general purpose for the order of the songs is a pessimistic journey through life and death and then a focus on major societal pressures that plague every day life. The positive part of the design is the unique flow and overall story alignment. The negative part of the design is that money doesn't particularly flow with the rest of the album, in a sense it seems to break the continuous pattern (most likely due to being b-side) also, you could argue that most of the b-side songs could be placed within the main side to tell an entire story of life through to death.\n\nIndividual songs:\nStunning - Eclipse, Time and Us And Them.\n\nEclipse is an amazing in fact epic completion to a wonderful album, the difficult ensued on somebody to tell a story of life in general is mainly to actually find a way of summarising in completion and that's exactly what Eclipse does perfectly. Time seems to last longer than it actually is, which is exactly what the song should do, through its lyrical value and amazing sounds, it manages to make you feel time as well. Us and Them is generally amazing due to its lyrical perception from the protagonist (if you will).\n\nUnique - On The Run, Great Gig In The Sky, Speak To Me.\n\nOn The Run is a unique view of music, it tends to tell a direct story through sound, an interesting idea for a major album. Great Gig In The Sky is also another song that seems to paint images in your head with a minimal use of words (except at the beginning) Speak To Me, just as impressive, seems like a preview to the entire album from the perception of an unborn child listening to the world.\n\nBad - None\n\nThere are no songs in this album that you'd want to skip over as any song removed destroys the entire album.\n\nOverall Dark Side of the Moon is a unique album, and still keeps its standards even today.""]",5.00 stars
boddah2006,"[""Definitely one of the best albums you'll ever hear in your life but The Wall is just a tad bit better. This also is probably one of the trippiest albums I've ever heard. If you ever smoke some weed and want to hear the perfect album to go with it put on Dark Side of the Moon. By the way I don't know if anyone knows this on this site but the best thing about weed is the effect that it has on the way music sounds to your ears it's truly incredible and one of the primary reasons I've ever tried it. Anyway, the guitar work on this album is way up there and David Gilmour is truly amazing and this shows on this album. Breathe is a great vocal song to introduce the listener to what's to come on this album. Time has one of the best guitar solos in it of all time. The Great Gig in the Sky I could do without but it does flow well with the album. Money is one of the best songs on the album other than Breathe with an amazing riff that is probably the most radio friendly songs on this album. Money also doesn't drag on without vocals for a while too so it's easy to understand why this song is played the most on the radio from this album. The rest of the songs are pretty good but the first few songs are easily the best. The cover art for this album is really good too. This is an essential for any rock album collection. You can listen to this album in any state of mind and you'll always enjoy new things about it. Masterpiece. Ah David Gilmour you never cease to amaze me.""]",5.00 stars

jshopa,"['I first heard Dark Side of the Moon when I was nine years old. I kinda dug it, then, since rock and roll to me at that point was Bryan Adams and Meat Loaf. It had a bit more substance to it. I cannot deny that Dark Side is a substantial album. It has all these themes and ideas and the band has lots of talent and ability. That it\'s pompous bullshit I could probably live with, if it weren\'t also so boring and obnoxious. Over the years, I\'ve heard Dark Side of the Moon frequently, it being one of those albums that is just unavoidable. In the kitchen at McDonald\'s, people would play it. On the stereo system at Future Shop, people would play it. On the portable stereo in the cloning laboratory, this one douchebag would play it every single day. The more I\'ve heard it, the more obnoxious it has come to feel to me (especially that month of hearing it at six in the morning every day). ""Money"" in particular irks me. What a scathing indictment of capitalism, biggest selling album of all time.\n\nAll that lugubrious seventies guitar, and all the lugubrious opinions that I must be dim for not enjoying it, that my only possible reason for disliking it is that I don\'t appreciate the finer things or that I\'m just saying it to be hip, as if that makes any sense. No, no, no, I\'m sorry, but when I put this on it\'s just forty-two minutes of boredom and frustration with only that one fine moment near the end of ""Brain Damage"" when it all swoons and they sing \'I\'ll see you on the dark side of the moon.\'\n\nBut they won\'t, no, I\'m afraid not. Maybe another fifteen years of hearing this album incessantly will change my views on it, but it seems unlikely at this point.\n\nAs for the Wizard of Oz thing, I remember in grade two or three putting a New Kids on the Block tape on while watching Saved by the Bell or something and it BLEW MY MIND.']",1.00 stars

jaysonle,"['First things first - this is without a doubt a classic album and I mean ""classic"" in the sense that\'s it\'s pretty much flawless. But, like so many have said before me, this is the most played out album ever. I know many music fans will say ""what\'s that got to do with the music?"" Well, it has something to do with it to a certain degree. I had so many friends in school annoy the hell out of me with this band. ""Dude, Floyd is the greatest of all-time,"" I\'ve heard it all before. Sorry to say but it kinda killed it for me. I urged myself to go deeper in their catalog and I became more of a fan of their stuff with Syd. Those other people I was talking about mostly loved _The Wall_ (which is completely overrated in my opinion). I will say Pink Floyd are a great rock band and just like The Doors; by a certain age it is considered unhip to claim them as favs. The Doors stuck with me alot better than these guys. Which is not to say Pink Floyd didn\'t create masterful albums like the one before you. Like I said before, it\'s a classic and I do recommend it to everybody on earth....if there\'s any left who hasn\'t heard it yet.']",4.00 stars
Black_Pitch,"[""Beautiful. Astounding. Unbelievable. Triumphant. These words could all adequately describe The Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd's magnum opus and ultimate success. The prism that adorns the front cover of the album is an iconic symbol in itself that is recognized all over the world and probably in outer space as well. This album alone has changed the face of music. From the beginning to the end, the whole album is an emotional roller coaster that is on a fast track towards the sky. Personally, my favorite song is Time. I think I can relate to it more than any other song on the album. Of course, all of the songs are special in there own way and I honestly cannot conjure up any complaints about them. The only thing is wish was that the album was longer because after I finish listening to it I almost feel cheated. I feel such a multitude of emotions during and after I listen through the whole album and I almost wish that I never listened to it just so I can start anew completely unaware of the absolute musical ecstasy that awaits me. Simply put, if there were no other music in the world aside from The Dark Side of the Moon then I would be perfectly content listening to it for the rest of eternity.""]",5.00 stars
Bagman,"[""Nice combo of soft rock and useless experimentations, it has it's own charm and the transitions between the songs makes it to be a great listening experience. It's not really original or innovative, but it should be a nice introduction to anyone interesed into progressive rock (or even into music), because it has a lot of great ideas and styles melded in a daring, good, simple, short and accesible album.\n\nTwo sides, it's always nice to listen to music as I was listening in two sides, it changes the way in which you listen to the album. This starts with a very short song (well, there is an introduction, but it's probably some samples), it's merely soft melody with a great arragment that falls into On the Run, the first 'experimental' track in here, it starts with some fast drumming and it's mainly a repetitive synth line that draws the base for other synth effects to come by, it's not really a song and I don't think that there is any main melody in here. After the sound of an explosion we fall into the next track.\n\nTime has one of the best intros I have ever heard, probably recorded with any percussion instrument the band could find. Then the song starts, the drummer plays some good passages as the other musicians play along the main riff, improvising over the main tune, until the song really starts (after two minutes of mandering), and everything comes into place as the vocals start singing (the vocals in here are great, and there is some female soul singer that makes everything in this song perfect), here comes the bluesy sound and it's the first rock song on the album, with a great guitar solo. Then the last track of this side is a piano ballad with slide guitar (I think it's slide guitar, and that there is slide guitar in almost every track, but I am not sure) and more singing from the female gospel singer (practically, a vocal solo, without lyrics), the feeling in the song changes from dramatic to desperate to calm and quiet.\n\nI don't like Money very much, the second side starts with that weird cash machine, paper-cut sample, then it gets more annoying, it's a cathcy pop tune in a unusual meter, the guitar works and has more of that bluessy feeling that dominate Time, only that it sound more silly, until the sax solo comes by, then after more improvised lines the song reaches it's climax, then fades out into the main verse of the song. I don't even understand how this song becomed a hit.\n\nUs and Them is more enjoyable, with a warmer melody line and more solos from the saxophone, maybe it's a little long, but neverthless it works, is the second best song on here, despite being a smooth ballad, but it has a great vocal melody and a lovely arragment, and the climax with gospel vocals works well. After the last chorus comes Any Colour You Like, which is the second experiment in here, is an instrumental track based on some synth or guitar riffs, I don't know how to explain the sound created in this track, maybe from arpeggios with lots of feedback and reverb, it has blues influence again, and I would say that it's my favorite track in here.\n\nThis ends with two short songs, Brain Damage based around a simple chord progression and some phrases from the slide guitar (I think that it's slide, but probably I am wrong) that fades into another climax with the a great choir and gospel vocals in the background. At the end there is a synth solo, or maybe it's a synth guitar, I really don't know. Then Eclipse is just the ending, with an anthemic feeling and more gospel vocals, it ends with the same heartbeating sample that opened the album.\n\nWith it's combination of soft vocals and progressive arragments, gospel vocals, saxophone solos and electronics, bluessy riffs and slide guitar (I don't know if it's slide guitar, but is sounds like one), heavy use of background samples and synth effects, The Dark Side of the Moon is a really great album that deserves to be listened all the way through, it's not as great or interesting as someone made you believe, but it's a masterpiece on it's own.""]",3.00 stars

rushomancy,"['This is a tough one to rate. On the one hand, the hype about this record is pretty much true. This really _is_ a perfect record in every way. On the other hand, I am never going to listen to this record again as long as I live, meaning that I find it literally unlistenable. I\'m splitting the difference and giving it a three.\n\nI\'m not sure why I can\'t listen to it anymore. Certainly it\'s not the only perfect record ever made- I would count Talk Talk\'s ""Laughing Stock"" as being a perfect record in all the ways this is a perfect record, and I still listen to that. It\'s not familiarity, either- I still listen to Led Zeppelin on a semi-regular basis, and I\'ve been listening to them forever. Yes, every song on this record gets overplayed on ""classic rock"" radio, but I haven\'t listened to ""classic rock"" radio since 1996, so that can\'t be it either. It\'s not a general feeling about Pink Floyd, because I don\'t have this attitude towards any of their other albums, not even _Wish You Were Here_. I don\'t know what it is, but something about this record gives me the feeling that it should not be listened to by human beings.\n\nAn interesting thing to note about this record: I like live music, and I have a tremendous number of bootlegs. Almost always, when a song or album is performed live, it gains something in the process. I mean, obviously, it loses something as well, there are certain inherent advantages to a studio recording, but nearly always a song performed live will contain something, no matter how small, some new aspect or way of looking at it that isn\'t on the studio recording. That\'s why I obsess about bootlegs; it\'s a way to hear something new even in something you already know well. With Pink Floyd, though, there is nothing of that sort. Every live version of this record I have heard is categorically inferior to the studio record. There is nothing on this album that can possibly be improved upon, ever. Again, the same could be true of Laughing Stock or The Drift, although it\'s impossible to say because those albums never have been and most likely never will be performed live. But even in that perfection, I feel some spark, something alive, something actively engaging me, and I don\'t get that from this record. It is an artifact of a dead civilization made by people who are all still alive.\n\nHell if I know.']",3.00 stars

trotz,"[""For those who know a little bit of history, those will know that this album has changed completely the world music panorama. This album has put progressive rock music and experimentation where they never would be again - it has made people to love and respect progressive music. And for almost 10 years progressive music was at every people's mouthes, this album marked deffinitely the beginning of a new era.\n\nWhat Pink Floyd did, particularly producer Alan Parsons, was transforming the band's experimental ideas in the form of superbly produced sofisticated songs. In fact, the album is so well produced that is astounding, almost unbelievable, to know it was edited in 1973 (!). The album shows so many variations, from all sorts of atmospheric sounds to gospel overblown singing, blended in a very delicate and high sensible way, creating a magnanimous piece of art - a true movie for the ears - with its several different pieces. Pink Floyd surely have moved towards pop, in the sense they put a fantastic effort in a way people would not find difficult to accept it. But in no way this is pop music.

Trick,"['There are people saying that the best Pink Floyd is the Syd Barrett\'s Floyd. I understand how bad they all want to go against everything and anything established as ""mainstream"" but there are things out of discussion: The Dark Side of the Moon is brilliant.\nHate me, but I think that the best collaboration that Syd Barrett gave to Floyd was to go mad so Roger Waters had something to write about insanity.\nI\'m saying this with all the respect that the album-and-a-half that Syd played in the band deserves.\nLet\'s face that Waters is the only member of Floyd capable to write a whole record and keep a high level of creativity and geniality through out all of the songs. David Gilmour and Richard ""Rick"" Wright may come out with a couple of unique pieces, and if Dark Side... is perfect (and it is), one of the reasons is that Dave and Rick received the inspiration-of-their-lives at the same time.\nIs so that the album includes one of the most unusual songs ever. ""The Great Gig In The Sky"" starts with a relaxing progression of chords until the voice of Clare Torry (someone who knew how to be at the right place at the right time) starts to sing orgasmic shouts.\nGilmour had already created ""his"" sound and confirms it on this record creating cosmic atmospheres on ""Breathe"" or playing violently on ""Time"" or ""Any Colour You Like"".\nNick Mason is in charge -with wise skills- of introducing the high peaks on the record. Songs like ""Us And Them"", ""Brain Damage"" or ""Eclipse"" wouldn\'t be the same without Nick\'s sensibility. Is remarkable his job on ""One The Run"", that race towards insanity that gets to insanity itself with all those clocks at the beginning of ""Time"".\nAlan Parson gets part of the credit. Somehow he managed to make the record sound timeless. Is because of him that The Dark Side of the Moon sounds and will always sound like it was recorded in the future in some far away galaxy.\nIn the middle of the album there\'s ""Money"", a rock song with an obligatory bass melody for all those who are learning the instrument. Dick Parry\'s sax fits perfectly with the rest of the band in the instrumental section.\nWords apart for the lyrics (laughters!) that get to anyone who listen to this album. Every word is there for a reason and every one is a revelation. Each quote makes a perfect graffiti.\nAnother thing is that Floyd never really leaves the psychedelic feeling but transforms it. Aren\'t colors what we ""see"" when Rick introduces layers and layers of moog sounds on ""Any Colour You Like""? Aren\'t black thick lines that Dave draws with his guitar on the same song? That\'s the evolution of psychedelia.\nThe end of the record is moving. ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"" form a perfect duet. The almost monochords melodies that Roger sings over the hypnotic guitar by Dave and the moog parts by Rick create an unique mood that unties itself and explodes when Nick detonates his drums while the hammond and the backing vocals are the expansive wave.\nThe final heartbeats are the same that we listened when ""Speak To Me"" started and had been with us through the whole record, sometimes at unlistenable levels, with their chilling presence.\nRock can\'t go higher.']",5.00 stars

Well, I can now fantastically reveal that this is a mostly irrelevant, hugely futile but extremely pleasant and entertaining way to listen to Dark Side.\n\nNow, you can find meaning or hidden messages in anything if you really want to, take religion as an example. But there was a certain synchronicity at work between the two disperate pieces, though I find it unlikely that Pink Floyd composed their masterpiece with a copy of The Wizard of Oz close to hand.\n\nIf you are intrigued enough to try this interesting little game, I highly recommend it, but with a few added preparatory procedures. Firstly, invite a few mates over; if you\'re going to be an obsessively sad music geek like me and my brother, then why not get your friends around to share in your obsessions? Secondly, get some weed in and start smoking about mid-afternoon with the intention of starting the show about nine in the evening. Things will make more sense then, believe me.\n\nYou will notice a few remarkable things, things so remarkable in fact that my heart started to beat faster when they happened. For the most part, the mood that the music creates is amazing; when Dorothy falls off the fence the three guys (who later become the Tin Man and the other two) rush to her aid just as ""On The Run"" begins with it\'s urgent drive and pulse quickening rhythm. Certainly a better score than Disney (or whoever) put to it originally.\n\nThen there is the fantastic moment that had me and my brother practically standing on our seats cheering when Toto (the dog) escapes from the basket on the back of the Wicked Witch\'s bike and runs back down the road to Dorothy just as ""Time"" kicks in following the percussion heavy build up. The whole experience made me care so much for the fate of that dog that I went straight to the dog pound the following day, bought eight puppies and set them free to other notable works of popular music.\n\n""The Great Gig In The Sky"" provides the incidental music to the great whirlwind scene, and as the vocal intensifies, so too does the strength of the storm, settling down again together as though they were inseperable entities.\n\nWhen the till chimes of ""Money"" begin, we get a panoramic view of the new colourful world that makes the scene seem something more akin to a David Lynch movie, it\'s wierd rather than magical, but again, an interesting take on the original score.\n\nThere was more, no doubt, but one of our friends thought it was such a load of rubbish he couldn\'t take it anymore, so we all went to the garden to smoke and shake off the strange sensation that there were greater powers at work in the world than we could ever understand.\n\nDepending on which way you look at it, this is either a great way to watch The Wizard of Oz, or a mesmerizing way to listen to Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nOne more thing about this album; it is perhaps not a great idea to listen to it late at night as you drift off to sleep, because when the alarms and bells start up, you will be wide awake and terrified for the remainder of the night.']",4.00 stars
projekct_5,"['Pues sí, sucede que este disco es una leyenda, así, de plano. Los Pink Floyd pudieron haber tenido su mayor momento de inspiración en este álbum y ellos en su actitud de ver hacia adelante no tuvieron mayor problema en continuar componiendo. Si bien mucho del chiste de este disco consiste en su producción, en las no tan novedosas pero bien aplicadas técnicas de grabación, de sobreposición de cintas y calibración de canales de manera que aparte de sonar envolvente y majestuoso, se sustentaba en composiciones de grueso calibre dentro del rock pop o rock progresivo como también se les puede identificar. Rolas como Time, Money o Breathe forman parte del inconsciente colectivo de millones en el mundo, cosa que solo los Beatles habrían logrado si nos remitimos a esto del rock. Lo que es mejor, este disco fue el que estuvo en los altos rieles de la popularidad durante chingomil años, lo cual le da una esencia de gusto forzoso, de must en a estantería de cualquier melómano sin immportar su tendencia musical.\nPersonalmente a mí me llegó en la edad más agónica y lamentable de toda mi vida, justo cuando cayeron en mis manos casi todos los discos de Pink Floyd: a los 18 años. Este disco fue el que más me jaló y todos mis recuerdos de nostalgia adolescente (nostalgia por el sufrimiento y la soledad... qué enfermo!)de perdediza cabeza, de penoso andar, de negras obligaciones, todo se quedó impregnado en esas madrugadas de sábado a las 5 am que tenía que ir a cubrir el servicio militar. Tenía que poner Time en el tocadiscos, sí, lo disfruté en vinil y me siento afortunado por eso... ahora; en ese entonces el soleo de Gilmour solo daba una línea descendente para que cayeran mis lágrimas adolescentes ante el esfuerzo que me implicaba cubrir el compromiso que era vivir. Salir del servicio militar y en lugar de irme a casita a descansar mis penas, iba por más, al bachillerato a busar a la mujer que me reanimaba, solo para quedar de nuevo en el piso al final del día. Amor igual a dolor? No lo creo, por eso rompí con esa fase de mi vida y la considero la peor, opté por el cinismo que Zappa me enseñó, burlándose de mis penas de amor; Pink Floyd simplemente no ayudaban para eso.\nDiez años después me reencuentro con un viejo amigo, tomo este disco en SACD con sonido superior al original y las vivencias son más tórridas y le digo a mi viejo amigo que no logrará arrancarme ninguna lágrima y así es: no puede ni podrá, porque ya lo acepté, a él y a The Wall, mi otro amigo de penas, a ambos los he aceptado y ahora simplemente los quiero y esa nostalgia ya es un recuerdo alejado de la concha cerrada que no volverá a abrirse a la pena, sencillamente porque ya no hay nada por qué sufrir.']",5.00 stars

bopdd,"[""I've probably listened to this album more than any other album in existence, in essentially every possible state of mind. Assuming Western culture continues to grow, the future generations will be listening to rock bands the way we listen to Beethoven, Bach, etc. I think this album will prove even more durable than one might guess. Music like this stays around the way a classic building might, and young people in the future will listen to this album and still gain a sense of awe as to what their ancestors created.\n\nPink Floyd is one of those bands that are almost taken for granted. They weren't really a rock and roll band and yet the common music lover insists on labeling them as such. Sure, they were primarily influenced by The Beatles, and as Brian Eno once said, they were a band that signified the end of an era not the beginning of a new one, but the Floyd do a more than hearty job at carrying The Beatles torch and still pointing toward the future of music with their own sound.\n\nDark Side is one of those monsters that's so simultaneously simple and impressive that it's resented as often as it's revered, but at the end of the day there is no album like it. Because of that, Dark Side reserves one of these rare spaces in the annals of history as an iconic album that wasn't necessarily influential in the Pet Sounds or Sgt. Pepper sense of the word. Dark Side stands on its own. It has as much in common with classical music, minimalism, and early electronica as it does the Beatles or Barrett-led Floyd. If the album has any flaw at all it's that the sound is a little too clean, yet paradoxically the clean production (which Gilmour fought for) is one of its trademarks.""]",5.00 stars

DarthKarl,"[""Pink Floyd's The Dark Side Of The Moon is not only only the greatest concept album of all time, not only the greatest Progressive Rock album of all time, it is my firm belief that Dark Side Of The Moon is simply the single greatest album ever in Rock history, period. No other album was ever this groundbreaking or innovative. Dark Side Of The Moon stayed on the charts for an utterly amazing 714 weeks, a truly astounding achievement. This album has some of the most amazing songs ever recorded, and they appear with startling regularity. Breathe, Time, Money, Us & Them. the mind blowing just keeps coming. The engineering, production, and use of sound effects to enhance the storyline in this album is just breathtaking. And the musicianship, by all four band members working as a unified team is one of the many variables that come together to give Dark Side Of The Moon it's just rank as the greatest. Another of the great things about the album is just when You think nothing can make it any better something does. Yet another example of it's utter greatness is the fact it has arguably the greatest shattering album finale ever with the stunning one two punch of Brian Damage/Eclipse. And Dark Side Of The Moon's delving deep into the human psyche and condition of man's fragile mind and intellect touches a thread deep in us all, and that, in the end, is what makes Dark Side such an unrivaled masterwork.""]",5.00 stars

Lostio,"['This is truly a quite excellent album. There is a whole feeling of mystic which is absolutely out of this world.\n\nFor an album to be good, the instrumentation must be highly dominated (guitars, drums, bass, any other...) and all that combined with the appropriate vocals. The vocals don\'t have to necessarily be LOUD, astonishing or unique, they must simply fit with the instrumentation and be appropriate to the song\'s meaning and feeling.\nFor an album to be excellent, besides this, all the songs must go well with each other and have an altogether concept or a common atmosphere.\nWhen this is present in an album, tied to all songs having a good sound quality and domination of sound, besides having to SOUND GOOD, and there is a good variety of sounds to entertain the listener, the album is a masterpiece.\n\nAnd The Dark Side Of The Moon is one of the most perfect examples of this. There is frequently present a mystic atmosphere, and absolute fascinatingly weird concepts of sound, which fit perfectly together. The title itself is a good way to capture this spirit. As we all know, the real dark side of the moon is something unvisited by the human race. It\'s something we know exists, and we keep seeing it covered by the... light side of the moon. So, it\'s something we must imagine how it will be, in this way being a mystic place that we all know to exist, but that, even though it could be so visible to us from the Earth\'s surface, it keeps getting covered and out of our eye reach...\n\nThis whole album is an entire journey through lunacy. That\'s one of the greatest ways to describe it. The second you insert this CD on your stereo, a trip begins through the world of lunacy that could be situated in the real dark side of the moon... You take off at Speak To Me and land back on Eclipse.\n\nHere\'s how this whole journey goes:\n\n1. (a) Speak To Me - This is the introduction to your voyage through the world of lunacy. It presents to you how crazy and absolutely unlike anything you ever heard before this trip really is. There is a heart beat at the start, maybe symbolizing your own heart beat, as to creep you out... There are some voice parts in here talking about being mac and some maniac laughter, another factor that presents you with the lunacy present in this trip you\'re about to take. More sound effects kick in, building more climax, and there is finally a scream that absolutely creeps you out! Keeps building up intensity, and then eases up to...\n(b) Breathe - This song is like the ""Alright, folks, you\'re about to go on a very troubled and agitated ride. Relax for now, ease up, and just chill... Prepare yourselves for the voyage ahead of you."" part of the trip. It is a smooth song, sounding quite nice and simple... It is still rock, as the voice of David Gilmour keeps remembering you... The power present is still relaxing, but a style of rock at the same time. As an individual song, Breathe has a good meaning to it: Relax through your life, but make sure to dedicate yourself to work. You may chill and go easy on life, but you must work hard and keep yourself dedicated. It simultaneously fits in as a lesson for life and as a step on this ""lunacy voyage"" we are taking as we listen to this album. Then, as the song ends, there is a connection to the next track as we we start listening to...\n2. On The Run - As a step on this voyage, it represents that ""Alright, you\'ve relaxed... Now, step up the pace as we start this magnificent trip."". As an individual song, it is a magnificent dominance of techno music and has some of the greatest synthetizer sound effects ever created. The effort was amazing, as they wanted to reproduce the pressure of travelling today. Some people say that using only technologic means to a song, it is a bad sign, since they didn\'t use real instruments to play it, showing a lack of quality. I say that is bullshit. Pink Floyd got even more amazing when they showed they could not only play some of the greatest instrumental work, but also dominate the world of technologic environment around them and still make something good out of it. Then, as the crazy and mind-blowing effects start building up to come out on the end as a explosion effect, they start easing up and leading directly to...\n3. Time - We are stepping through the voyage already. All the songs so far have been a way to get ready for the trip and we are now already on it. The first part of this trip is about a direct topic, and so is another song ahead, as to give a direct lesson to life for people, STILL sounding good and keeping track with the voyage of crazyness. This one is about time. It\'s unbelievable how the topic itself keeps getting unraveled on the song\'s composition. It is 7 minutes long, showing already a considerable extension of time. Still, it serves its purpose, always with a rock sound to it. The bell and alarm effects at the beginning are a way to introduce the topic, which is, by now, very obvious to be about time. These effects are a way to say ""Attention now! The voyage has now technically begun and we are about to say something serious."" Then, come the spectacular effects made with the constant beat through the first minutes, also with deep instrumentation work from the back, and spectacular drum dominance. Extending this part so long is also a way of saying ""Get ready. It is an important lesson we are about to say, and absolute attention would be appreciated. Start preparing yourselves, please, the voyage has begun now, so get aware of it as you enter a new world. You will now learn our first topic. Please be aware of this."". As this kicks into the listener\'s head, the song begins 2 minutes and a half after the start of the track, and the powerful voice of Gilmour introduces this topic. The instrumentation is always great, and we can obviously tell the dedication of this band in this song, which hits you more on the impact of this subject. The solo is absolutely amazing, and is there to show you that, although the trip is getting crazy, this is still a pure rock album. Touching meaning to it, too, this song is about how time passes so quickly before we are aware of it and that we should make the most out of every moment, controlling the destiny at our hands, without letting time simply slip away... There is a reprise of the initial song ""Breathe"" at the end of this song, as another sign of ""Well, keep this subject in you. Now, relax, and chill out, as we are entering, again, a new step of our magical trip..."", which directly connects to...\n4. The Great Gig In The Sky - A unique song, as it is merely instrumental work, with some voice parts and a mind-blowing scream practically all the way through it! Now, we are having an indirect lesson on the meaning of death and how it is natural and, therefore, should not be feared. We have an introduction for this topic, as an Irish doorman, Gerry, tells us how it is not necessary to be afraid of dying, since you\'ve gotta go sometime... The whole scream is highly interpretable by many, but it very possibly is a way of showing you how much death should not be feared. Hearing that scream makes you think about maybe a person in constant pain, or someone terribly frightened of death, and in, whatever the case may be, you\'ll always get a feeling of seeing just how ridiculous it is to be afraid of something so natural, even if it is very mystic... The dominance of the instruments is always great, as we are shown a good and with enough variety tune all the way through the scream. A nice organ sound to it, maybe to relate more to death, but that combines perfectly with the scream and the meaning in this song.\n5. Money - Now, the trip starts taking more beat as we are said ""Hey, we are on a lunacy trip, but we\'ve still got the style! Listen to the lesson in THIS song!"". This is the other song about a specific and direct topic, which, in this case also coincidentally, was also all revolved around the song itself. First, with the \'cash loop\' effects, that quickly pointed out to us the subject at hand now, and the rhythm present throughout the song, which resembles a kind of greed and financial ambition. Actually, even this song got to give Pink Floyd lots of money, since it was also the only song off Dark Side of the Moon to reach the top 20 in the US. This album has another, maybe more indirect symbol of the ambition money supposedly brings: there is an introduction of a new instrument here - the saxophone, which they mastered the dominance of perfectly. It is a great extra to this song, and strengthens it, too. The constant feeling of greed and ambition in this song, along with the \'cash loop\' effect, help the listener stay directly focused on the money subject, and helps him with the lesson at hand: Money does not bring happiness. This lesson is more indirect than the one at Time, as the lyrics are not so specific and have a deeper meaning, in which the language has some signs of irony related to the lesson they\'re trying to tell here. It\'s a good turn on this album, and helps make it have more variety, which obviously contributed to the grandiosity of it. The fact that there is a huge bit in this song which is only instrumental managed to show us how Pink Floyd can symbolize us something so greatly without any presence of voice, just instruments. And the meaning is still there, even when there is no-one singing. After this unique song of this album, the trip carries on and is start to approach its near ending, as we are taken on to...\n6. Us And Them - This is song also serves as another sign to the listener, now more of the ""Well, we\'ve shown our style big time, but now we have more important and deep steps for you to go through in this trip... After all, this voyage is not over yet."" The echoes are great here, and their purpose is amazing, since they become a symbol of the \'deep\' meaning in this song. It is a direct calling to the listener as a way for him to carefully listen and understand the spacial meaning of this song. This is also why this song is done in such a slow and quite tune... Serves as a way for the listener to pay more attention and take more careful notice to the details. It\'s an awesome song about the tendency of people to separate themselves and go against one another for even the most simple things... The saxophone solos here are a great way to make the listener take notice and think more carefully on the meaning of this song, and also symbolize how old-fashioned this \'lesson\' is. They represent the blues kind of songs, so it takes the listener back in time so that it becomes present the idea that this is something that has occurred since the beginning of times: The partition between people and the tendency that has become of that. It makes a great purpose on this album and then it directly connects to...\n7. Any Colour You Like - A fascinating instrumental bit which is a trip through your mind and imagination, as your brain gets all agitated after listening to the great sound effects of this song. It is the next step of this voyage, the ""Alright, we gave you our lessons. Think about them, deeply, as we go on through the crazyness and lunacy and come to our next part of this trip. Now, relax again and chill out... You have seen the most important parts of this voyage. It is coming to an end, so get ready and relax..."" This is actually, unofficially, the 2nd reprise of Breathe and serves almost the same purpose as that song. It then introduces us to...\n8. Brain Damage - This is the definite statement of lunacy, crazyness and mental instability this album has stamped all around it. It is saying to you ""Well, you have come this far, so your mind has gone through a permanent transformation and you are a lunatic!"" It is obviously only a symbol of how such a wide range of lessons and important informations will affect you, making you have a different point of view on everything around. At least, that is what they intended and this song shows you that, as it represents lunacy in its most natural state. The mild laughters contribute to this symbol of lunacy, as it is a known fact many of the crazy folks out there sometimes have a tendency to idiotically laugh. Great song composition , though, and an excellent power and intensity given to the chorus of this song, which only contributes more and more to its message. It is a great and one of the most essential parts of this album, as it is starts clearing up your mind on how influential this album may become to you and how much of renovation these ideas may become to you... Afterwards, we conclude the crazy trip with...\n9. Eclipse - This is a perfect conclusion to this album, as it is way of saying ""This voyage has come to its end, but now everything around you will look and seem different to you, after the influence this trip has made on you. You will not forget us so easily!"" You hear this song, and your minds starts going back to normal, after the out of this world intensity and power present in this whole album starts to fade away and come together as one to your mind. Now, you are confused, but you can\'t help but feel different and better about yourself. There is a heart beat in the end of this song, which symbolizes that now everything is normal again, but that the mystic is present everywhere you go. The meaning is so great, as it says that, even though you might have thought this was too revolutionary and too mystic an album, the fact is that all the mystic and all the mystery is present in your everyday life and that, after listening to this album, you will hopefully be aware of it.\n\nIt is a great trip to the mind, to the ears, and even to your thought. It\'s a masterpiece and a divine piece of work, that definitely deserves the title of one of the greatest rock album of all-time. Get into this album, and you WILL feel changed.']",5.00 stars

Matt_K,"['Laughter, screaming, calm, anxiety, money, death, madness, insight – put them all together and you have a snapshot of inner life. Express them through a mix of rock, jazz, chill, electronic music, soul, and ambient and you’re approaching the audio equivalent, something that expresses the thoughts we do not speak through a shifting palette of sounds that reflect their emotional context. And like that stream of consciousness, TDSOTM is uninterrupted, every track flowing into the next seamlessly.\nAm I making good use of my time? What happens when we die? Am I making enough money? What can I do about all the conflict in the world? Am I alright in the head? Though many would call Pink Floyd and progressive rock pretentious, I think the fundamental reason DSOTM resonates with so many is that its themes aren’t pretentious in the slightest. Waters’ lyrics, centre stage for the first time here, articulate everyman worries in an unvarnished and direct way that stands in stark contrast to Peter Gabriel singing about the courtiers of the midnight nutmeg queen. Fragments of voices from ordinary people around as Floyd were working on the album are sprinkled throughout, consolidating the impression of the album being a reflection, possibly as you sleep, of things encountered and wondered about during the day.\nOpener Speak To Me is a musique concrete overture establishing motifs that will appear throughout the album, Breathe In The Air is gorgeous dreamy soft rock, On The Run is a head-nodding techno track that sounds like almost nothing else around at the time, Time is a grim look at humanity’s tendency to fuck about with a suitably foreboding backing (gotta love Mason’s arresting rototoms at the beginning), and then Breathe In The Air returns to soothe you before Great Gig In The Sky and guest vocalist Clare Torry delivering a screaming, soaring, sobbing vocal that is still completely coherent as it says more about death than even Waters’ lyrics could. Every segment is wildly different from the next but the use of motifs and extremely accomplished segues between each gives Side A of TDSOTM a level of cohesion like few albums before it.\nSide B is a little less compelling – Money is fun and its bass line a reminder that Waters is more than a mouth, and Us And Them’s contrast between the naïve wishy-washy verses and overwhelmingly intense/dark chorus is great, but these two tracks alone are nearly fifteen minutes and I can see attentions wandering a little here. However, maybe it’s OK for there to be a lull in the middle and give the listener a breather before the one-two punch of Brain Damage and Eclipse that close the album. Brain Damage’s intentionally off-sounding guitar backing and creepy lyrics create a need for something comforting that is provided by the big sing-along chorus and cathartic title drop before Eclipse succinctly brings everything together in a grand final statement of organ and backing singers and Abbey Road Studios doorman Gerry O’Driscoll spookily reminds us “There is no dark side of the moon really. Matter of fact it’s all dark” before the heart beat that opened the album returns, creating a perfect loop.\n\nI do not think it’s the greatest album ever made (I don’t think it’s even Floyd’s best album) but it is certainly very very good and vitally important in the way it introduced mass audiences to more profound, adventurous modes of music. It still sounds great today (shout-out to a certain Alan Parsons who engineered it) and it doesn’t have a single serious problem with it. Excellent stuff that ushers in a period of Pink Floyd being one of the best bands on the planet.']",

kxngE,"['The Dark Side of The Moon is the eighth studio LP by the legendary progressive rock band, Pink Floyd. It is a concept album that takes listeners across various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat. The themes often revolve around conflict, morality, greed, time, and mental illness. The album consists of 10 different tracks. DSOTM is widely considered as the \'greatest album of all time, the progressive elements were creatively put together and the sequenced concepts complemented each other, in turn, this created a revolution for Rock. In my opinion, there are a lot of albums better than DSOTM - it isn\'t even the best Pink Floyd album(Wish You Were Here and Meddle>DSOTM), nonetheless, after understanding the concepts and the process of creating this album, I can definitely understand why someone would elect this album as their greatest album of all time. The progressive elements on this album are generally repetitive, thus, being worse in terms of technicalities compared to Wish You Were Here. I genuinely feel like playing this album on shuffle would be the stupidest thing a Pink Floyd fan could do considering the sequenced track-list. Utilising new experimental technicalities, Pink Floyd managed to exploit synthesizers and multitrack recorders. DSOTM is a lyrical masterpiece that delves into everything that we consider as ""human life"". Upon the release of DSOTM, this album was met with both, critical and commercial success.\n\nDespite the conceptual intellects behind this album, I feel like there is a silver lining for the people who do dislike this project; the repetitive progressive elements disregard what progressive music really is. The album cover for Dark Side of The Moon might just be the most recognisable and iconic album cover in the music industry - the simplicity of the cover seems to make it so memorable. This album ended up on the Billboard top charts for over 700 weeks(14 years+). Why wouldn\'t it? This chaotic masterpiece diversifies life nihilistically through incredible experimental aspects which end up setting a base for Pink Floyd\'s own career.\n\nThis album kicks off with the track ""Speak To Me"". The eager heartbeats are followed up with pennies falling down, symbolising greed and setting up the theme for the sixth song, ""Money"". As the billing continues, we can hear a man begin to talk comfortably, soon, the words turn into ominous laughs. When these laughs become intolerable, the screams escape from the person\'s mouth, sounding similar to the ones heard by a newborn baby. The intellectual skit is followed up by a progressive masterpiece, ""Breathe"". As the continuation to the album’s opening track “Speak to Me,” which seamlessly segues into “Breathe,” it is the first time we hear any lyrics. The track utilises a soothing Uni-Vibe Guitar Foot pedal-operated phaser. The haunting vocals carry the percussive drums, the synth influence gives this track a commercial boost. Conceptually speaking, this track tells the \'baby\' from ""Speak To Me"" to breathe - the first command any human would get after being born. In the beginning, life is as simple as taking a breath. As you grow, you begin to establish yourself while still building bonds with others. There’s resilience in your youth. This concept is later followed up by ""On The Run"" and ""Time"". The non-vocal “On the Run” is a standout with footsteps racing from side to side successfully eluding any number of odd malevolent rumbles and explosions only to be killed off by the clocks ticking that leads into “Time.” The rhythemic electronic influence does result in negative repetition, making the track boring, nonetheless, it perfectly lines up with the album\'s track-list.\n\nTime follows up the previous track, ""On The Run"" with a commercially appealing production, utilising the sounds of stacked-up clock ringing as an intro, Pink Floyd sets the theme of the track, telling us that time can easily slip by, but most of us do not realise it until it\'s too late. The clever percussive instruments laid over a subtle guitar solo complements the gritty atmosphere of the track, boosting its calibre as a commercial hit. The desperate vocals work very well with the guitar solo, I absolutely LOVE the sudden drop of the vocals after the first few seconds of the song. The guitar solo on this track might be my favourite guitar solo of all time, along with ""Comfortably Numb"". The Great Gig Sky complements the previous track nihilistically, telling us that we all are going to die one day regardless of who we are. The fear of mortallity is perfectly displayed through this cut. I love the soothing melodic vocals stacked over haunting harmonies and percussive synths. The title of the track refers to Heaven. This most important aspect of this song, in my opinion, is the way Richard’s organ shines through and beautifully accents Clare’s jaw-dropping vocal performance. This combination makes for the most exhilarating musical piece my ears have ever been exposed to. Money utilises a clever execution cash registers ringing while the coins were clinking. This execution blended in with the bassline and a soothing drum beat. The track symbolises greed, following up the intro skit, ""Speak To Me"". The track discusses how humans are willing to do anything in order to gain money. The notorious Sax solo might be the best part of this entire album, it was so damn smooth. I loved the atrocious guitar solo, it perfectly captures an esscense of the vintage era of Rock.\n\nAs the instruments from ""Money"" start fading away, a new set of synth notes start playing, introducing us to one of the most under-appreciated tracks of all time - ""Us and Them"". The bliant echoes seem to complement the peaceful Sax solo, which is layered over guitar synths. The passionate harmonies drove my ears crazy(in a good way). The song criticizes the cut and dry narrative that is given in a time of war. This song reveals that we’re all just ordinary people, and when one takes a deeper look, war is senseless death. Basically, the track shows a beautiful representation on why wars are useless. I love the transition from ""Us and Them"" to ""Any Colour You Like"". An instrumental track featuring keyboard and guitar solos, “Any Colour You Like” has no lyrics or sound clips but many can interpret the song’s message to be – you are the master of your universe, your own destiny so make it any colour you like. Ironically, the actual meaning of the title is the complete opposite – it refers to the illusion of choice. Any Colour You Like…Would that explain the rainbow on the art cover? On the previous instrumental, you can hear running that never stops in a panicky mood somewhat. I believe that instrumental represents the bland white line while this groovy instrumental represents the rainbow. The beauty of this track is resembled through the instruments - there are merely infinite interpetations you could percieve after listening to this track. The ending of ""Any Colour You Like"" cleverly transititions into a synth heavy track, ""Brain Damage"". The overall message of this track provokes the fact that we ALL are lunatics. I love the creative usage of percussive drums and guitar synths - it creates a gloomy atmosphere, complementing the concept of this track. Eclipse is the outroduction of this beautiful album. During an Eclipse, the sun is covered by the moon, thus showcasing the ""Dark side of the moon"". As the climax of the album, “Eclipse” highlights simply that the summation of everything you are, as much as it matters to you, as hard as it is to get it all “in tune,” eventually it’s “eclipsed by the moon” - therefore, not really important at all. The pessimistic outlook on this album ends with heartbeats - conveying the end of a person\'s life. ""There is no dark side in the moon really Matter of fact it’s all dark”, possibly the most pessimistic and nihilistic ending to an album.\n\nTrack by Track Rating:\nSpeak To Me - 10/10\nBreathe - 10/10\nOn The Run - 8/10\nTime - 10/10\nThe Great Gig In The Sky - 10/10\nMoney - 10/10\nUs and Them - 10/10\nAny Colour You Like - 9/10\nBrain Damage - 9.5/10\nEclipse - 9.5/10\nOverall Score: 96/100\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is an album about how terrible some aspects of human life are. Even knowing how terrible life is, the album as an optimistic view, a kind of “happy sad” view, as shown in Breathe in the Air. I think, The Dark Side of the Moon is a metaphor for “The Dark Side of Life”, and when they say “matter fact it’s all dark”, I think they’re saying there’s no good part of life. I love the sequenced track-list and the minor details connecting the entire album together while also covering an extremely unique subject. In my opinion, this album is the best conceptual album of all time; Yup, better than ""In The Aeroplanes Over The Seas"", ""Wish You Were Here"", and ""OK Computer"", conceptually speaking.']",5.00 stars

LukaB16,"['Quite often with these albums that are monolithic in reputation I tend to say the vacuous statement of ""what more is there to say about this album"" because there reaches a point where it\'s difficult for more to be said. There\'s a wall of comments that end up being inevitably repeated into oblivion. As such, I try to just move past it and say something that was more personal when it comes to my listening experience. Saying all this, despite not being rated as highly as another of their albums, this album is arguably the most famous album ever made. As such, in a cruel twist of fate, the cliche thing to say here is not my opinion, but it is in fact to say ""what more is there to say about this album?"" It\'s reached a level of self-awareness that warrants a lack of opinion.\n\nI can\'t think of many instances where the album reaches such stature, yet here we are, it\'s an album that\'s undoubtedly grand and massive. Now, I don\'t think I\'d say it\'s their best but then again, it\'s not too far off. It\'s got my checklist for Pink Floyd, David Gilmour singing, dense atmosphere and incredibly wanky guitar soloing. It\'s a low bar they have to cross frankly yet they\'ve failed to miss it so far. As expected, the peaks of this album are undeniably epic. Time is probably the peak for me, going toe-to-toe with tracks like Echoes and Shine On You Crazy Diamond. Maybe this album occasionally shows it age, sure, but when it\'s good it\'s so. fucking. good. It never breaks that barrier of consistently outstanding to launch it higher but man, it does enough to be really enjoyable from beginning to end.\n\nThe flow, the performances, the production, everything is done so well.

Vernon_Warez,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(Review #95, July 14th [2021])\n\nPink Floyd\'s most popular and arguably most acclaimed release is undoubtedly The Dark Side of the Moon. I suppose I have a few ""controversial"" takes on a variety of things in music, but the opinion I\'ve gotten the most flack for from random people is that I think this is the worst of the ""classic"" Floyd releases. I even find releases like the less than acclaimed Ummagumma to be superior to this record. I could even go a step further and say that some of their post-70s releases such as The Division Bell are equal in quality. I just genuinely cannot understand the popularity of this album.\n\nStrangely enough, I think the instrumentation is great here. Nick Mason is a strong drummer who does some very interesting work on ""Time."" Roger Waters is rightfully remembered as one of the most gifted bassists of all time, as heard in places such as the iconic ""Money"" riff. Richard Wright wonderfully demonstrates his organ and piano abilities on this release as can be heard on cuts like ""Eclipse"" and ""Any Colour You Like."" Elsewhere, David Gilmour does some impressive guitar work although I do find him a bit overrated. Overall, the instrumentals found on The Dark Side of the Moon are quite fantastic and virtually perfect.\n\nHowever, said perfection is what bothers me so much about the instrumentation done here. Everything is incredibly clean and smooth sounding. While I understand the appeal to this type of sound (I even find that tracks like ""Great Gig in the Sky"" utilize it well), I find that it makes much of the record sound somewhat musically average. Everything begins to blend together and sound the same to my ears; and not in a good ""concept album"" sort of way. These completely flawless instrumentals just seem to suck the majority of the life out of the album. Tracks like ""Breathe"" could have been absolutely lovely pieces, but they sound totally passionless to my ears.\n\nAs such, the album sounds completely dull in many parts. Take, for example, the instrumental ""On the Run."" Many have praised it as one of the greatest rock instrumentals ever created, but I can\'t help but find it a barely decent interlude that completely overstays it\'s welcome. Other songs such as ""Time"" drag on for much too long. While I can appreciate a good progressive-based and spacey track, the length of every song on this album that exceeds four minutes could be cut down. Every time that I think a certain track is about to blow me away, it continues to persist until I grow completely tired of it. This results in more of an uncomfortable slow crawl through the album than a pleasant listen.\n\nThe vocals here are also quite weak in my opinion. Most of the tracks here are sung by guitarist David Gilmour, who I simply don\'t find to be that interesting of a vocalist. While he does quite well on songs like ""Us and Them,"" tracks like ""Breathe"" sound completely underwhelming and average vocally. One would expect completely entrancing vocals throughout The Dark Side of the Moon to accompany it\'s smooth instrumentals. However, Gilmour sounds either completely uninterested (""Breathe"") or needlessly angry (""Money"").\n\nHowever, on the final two tracks, Gilmour\'s vocals are replaced by those of Roger Waters. Waters is an incredibly talented bassist and rhythm instrumentalist. While his vocals aren\'t very technically impressive, I prefer them over Gilmour\'s. Waters\' vocal style is slightly more fitting for the spaced out instrumentals presented on The Dark Side of the Moon. Both songs Waters is featured on, ""Brain Damage"" and ""Eclipse"" have some vocals that are fitting and reasonably pleasant. Waters isn\'t the most outstanding vocalist I\'ve ever heard. He is far from it, actually. However, I prefer his vocal abilities to those of Gilmour.\n\nThe production and mixing here is quite wonderful, I will admit. The production was primarily done by the band themselves. It is obvious that the group knew what they were doing, as tracks like ""The Great Gig In the Sky"" have some excellent production that makes them sound smooth yet very grand. I suppose one could argue that the production is a heavily contributing factor towards my previously mentioned dislike for the overly suave sound of the record. However, the production is undeniably a massive achievement in the history of music production even if I think it contributes to the album\'s worst factor.\n\nOverall, I personally find The Dark Side of the Moon one of the most painfully overrated albums ever recorded. I just simply do not understand why people consider this a masterpiece. It sounds like nothing more than a good-not-great but overly polished psychedelic-progressive rock album. Nonetheless, The Dark Side of the Moon is an incredibly important release that influenced thousands of future artists. To dismiss it\'s influence and importance would be foolish. This is a defining release of the 20th century, no matter what I think of it.']",3.50 stars
Dylan14,"['This review was requested by the user BruhingtonBruh on the ""Go Review That Album Game"".\n\nWhen I initially rated this album way back when I first joined the site (nearly 7 years ago at the time of posting!) I gave this a 5 star. Per my rating system, an album has to meet one of 3 criteria to get this:\n1. It has to be perfect (no flaws, or if there are any, they are not noticeable to me)\n2. It is a groundbreaking work\n3. It shapes my life or my music tastes permanently.\n\nSo let\'s go through each of the points I have made. Does this still satisfy the criteria for the 5 star rating?\n1. It has to be perfect. Yes.\n\nThe one thing that Pink Floyd do right time and time again in their heyday (being roughly from Meddle-The Wall) is the way they weave together various themes and seamlessly connect the tracks. Here the connections are very fluid - every song connects to the next. This can make you think the album is just 2 long songs with several movements, not unlike a classical composition. In fact that is a perfect way to describe it, and it\'s the ideal way that a concept album should be.\n\nThere are also some various good elements throughout the songs, which have been covered in great depth in other reviews here and elsewhere, including, but not limited to,\n* David Gilmour\'s guitar solo on ""Time""\n* The vocal improvisations on ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" sung by Clare Tory (which was done in a single take)\n* The ratatom in ""On the Run""\n* The lyrics of Brain Damage, which, although not explicit, seem to be referring back to Syd Barrett.\n* and so on...\n\nNow, previously I mentioned this is a concept album, which it is. It focuses quite a bit on the corporate world (Money, Us and Them) and the idea that your time here is limited so don\'t waste it toiling away (Breathe, Time), else you go all insane, potentially through the use of drugs (Any Colour You Like, Brain Damage).\n\nAll this tricks here make for a very well manufactured record which tickles the fancy of many listeners, with no flaws that I can notice.\n\nThat\'s point 1 done, which is enough to give it the 5 star rating. But what about 2 and 3?\n\n2. It is a groundbreaking work. No.\n\nThis is a bit of surprise. You would think that being such a popular album means that it does some that\'s new to the music world, but alas it doesn\'t. The idea of a concept album was done before, prominently with the Who\'s Tommy released 4 years prior to this.\n\nAnd even if we ignore other artists and consider only the Pink Floyd discography, there isn\'t so much experimentation. I would even argue the next album, Wish You Were Here, is more experimentive than this. Of course, Piper blows both of these out of the water in terms of this.\n\n3. It shapes my life or my music tastes permanently. Ehh...\n\nFor the Floyd, it\'s the next album, Wish You Were Here, that shapes me, and more specifically, the title track. While the title ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" describes where I think people go to in the afterlife, the song itself doesn\'t shape my thoughts. This is why Wish You Were Here ranks above this, in my opinion - the personal connection.\n\nBut anyway, this is an essential album that should already be in your library. If not, what are you waiting for?']",5.00 stars

adamtb24,"['I can\'t recall what mood I was in when I first listened to what is arguably considered Pink Floyd\'s magnum opus, The Dark Side of the Moon. When it came to Pink Floyd, I was only familiar with The Wall and songs like Money. Then I listened to this album, and it hypnotized me from start to finish. This is quite the equivalent of an album that feels like an acid trip but in the best way possible. From the opening sound of the heartbeat, you\'re sucked into an album that has the most dreamlike quality possible with tracks like ""Us and Them"", ""Time"", and ""Brain Damage"" just giving an entrancing feel to the listener. My personal favorites are the closing tracks to both sides, with the instrumental ""The Great Gig In The Sky"" feeling larger than life and the album closer ""Eclipse"" building and building to an epic climax. This is one album that lives up to the hype given to it as Pink Floyd and engineer Alan Parsons making music best described as hypnotic. The Dark Side of the Moon is quite honestly a trip, and I mean it in the best way.']",5.00 stars
ColdInEden,"['As you know, this album is highly appreciated among music lovers, but I unfortunately did not like it so much. Progressive Rock has its place in music and I am sure that there are many people who would enjoy listening to it. However, as far as I\'m concerned, Pink Floyd\'s music is nothing more than an imitation of progressive rock. It lacks originality and does not even try to be innovative. This album is just another copy of something else that was already done before. I have been listening to some progressive rock lately and I think that Pink Floyd could learn a lot from the bands like Yes, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, or even Rush. These bands are always trying to create new sounds or at least never seem to be bored of what they are doing. ""The Dark Side Of The Moon"" is a very safe album because it does nothing to push the envelope or challenge the listener. There are good ditties like ""Time"" or ""Money"" on here, but for the most part this album is just boring. I hope you do not think that I am a snob because of this. I realize that many people enjoy this album and are not likely to read this review. I also realize that it is possible that I just did not like this album for whatever reason. I am stating my case regardless. Thanks for your time.\nRate: 3/5']",3.00 stars
marsb,"[""Pink Floyd was not just the least-fun progressive rock band ever, but also the least-prog prog band ever. Insofar as prog rock could be defined as Britain’s very ambitious attempt at making rock high art - expanding on what the Beatles and the Who did in the late-60s on albums like Sgt. Pepper’s and Tommy - by, for example, layering sounds into symphonies and making albums play like ‘more’ than a collection of songs, and most obviously, by integrating classical music’s complex time signatures, then of course Pink Floyd is prog rock.\n\nHere’s the thing: I think that’s a very shallow read of prog rock, and while a lot of prog is very consciously complex, prone to being bogged down by overconceptualizing and ‘look at me' classical sections, the very best prog still ripped, plain and simple. It appealed for the same reason that rock originally appealed: base desire to hear music with a good fucking beat and a flashy solo, and its additional desire to incorporate jazz and classical (i.e. music your parents listened to) was admirable but perhaps contradictory in nature.\n\nPink Floyd never ripped, at least, not until Animals which was their last great album anyway. To use a point of comparison, Radiohead rocked more; an embarrassing prospect. What Pink Floyd did instead, either under Syd Barrett or Roger Waters, was pure atmosphere: a lot of long build-ups and cathartic releases (they’re the original post-rock band) and David Gilmour as a guitar player was more about tone than anything else; notes-wise, he was as economic as they come.\n\nWhat I love about Pink Floyd and the other prog rock acts is that they represented a time when complex music could actually be popular, the last gasp before the dumbing down: that The Dark Side of the Moon managed to sell some 40 million copies as one of the best-selling albums of all time is no small feat for an album with barely any individual songs or distinct tunes. (Of course, having iconic art that could easily be put on a t-shirt or converse shoe didn’t hurt either; Pink Floyd’s secret weapon was Storm Thorgerson’s artwork and I hope they paid him millions.)\n\nThe atmosphere of Pink Floyd’s major prog rock albums is unfortunately offset by Roger Waters’ puddle-deep philosophies and overbearing ego. Jean-Paul Sartre actually got it wrong, hell is not other people, hell is being trapped in a room with Roger Waters, Eric Clapton and Van Morrison to talk about politics, immigration and life-saving lockdowns. (If I had a gun with two bullets, I’d shoot Roger Water twice.) Topics like money, the music industry, politics and (um) walls, are all worth discussing, yes, but it’d take a smarter person than Roger Waters to pull them off. The smug irony of “Money” has made it so that I’ll never enjoy that 7/4 riff backed up by cash register sounds: I get the same reaction to “Money” that everyone else does to “Imagine,” and all that talk of John Lennon’s hypocrisy can be easily leveled at multi-millionaire Roger Waters too. (Irony is less quotable, and thus, harder to make fun of, than sincerity.) All told, I don’t agree with the less popular but still mild take that Pink Floyd was a better band when they were ‘dumber,’ politically - or just apolitical - under Barrett, but I see where that thought comes from.\n\nBecause Roger Waters was so shallow, it bled into the concepts of Pink Floyd’s four major post-Meddles albums too. Case-in-point is that The Dark Side of the Moon doesn’t even have a concept and yet consistently ranks among the best concept albums of all time: there’s no story like Quadrophenia or The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, and if all it has going for it are themes (that don’t interact with one another from song to song), then The Velvet Underground & Nico, about heroin and BDSM, is my favourite concept album. See how that works, or rather, doesn’t? By the same token, Wish You Were Here, Pink Floyd’s lovely tribute to Syd Barrett, has two songs about the music industry (wow, I wonder what Roger Waters has to say about them! I bet they’re nuanced takes!) that both feel like they disrupt that album’s emotional resonance (and flow), although I get why they’re there; Animals is basically a spark notes’ version of George Orwell’s Animals with no actually characters (because Roger Waters doesn’t have anything more to say than ‘government = bad’) and I don’t even want to get started with The Wall. (Okay, here’s some faint fucking praise for it: I’d rather listen to Roger Waters’ “Mother” than Andy Summers’ “Mother” on Synchronicity.)\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is clearly the work of the full band though, whereas The Wall is very much Roger Waters’ album or A Momentary Lapse of Basic Human Decency and The Division Bonghit are David Gilmour solo albums in all but name and both different varieties of unlistenable. Since Dark Side is made up of 10 small(ish for prog) tracks, there’s more ‘musical moments’ for your ears to bite onto than Wish You Were Here or Animals. (But on the flip-side, The Wall is made up of 26 small tracks and there are far less?)\n\nAnd it ultimately works to the album’s advantage that there is even less focus on words than there are on Animals and The Wall: not only are three of the 10 songs instrumental (including “Any Colour You Like” which includes some scatting), but there’s no words during Clare Torry’s outpouring on “The Great Gig in the Sky” either. (And so to hear Roger Waters drone on and on about how everything will be eclipsed by the moon on the final song is kind of a letdown.) The best parts of this album are purely instrumental - not surprising; Waters was neither a tuneful or powerful or particularly noteworthy vocalist - but also not any Gilmour solo either. Here are some of my favourite moments on this album: Gilmour’s pedal steel guitar on “Breathe” moving out of 60s’ country and into 70s’ space (it’s a neat trick that only a few artists figured out, which is that the pedal steel guitar - more than any synth - has a naturally spacey sound); the spacious mix of the mini-symphony of clocks and Waters’ muted strings that open “Time” that give way for that piano to float you home from space; the wash of synths in the intro of “Any Colour You Like” (they should have just kept it to just those synths.)\n\nMy favourite song here, and has been the case since as long as I’ve known the album, is “On the Run”: a brooding instrumental that predates a lot of art rock instrumentals near the decade’s end (ie. Bowie, Japan) but with absolutely zero German connection - truly, good on Floyd! “On the Run” is mostly just a synth and a lot of studio gimmickry, but the additional effects - a metallic groan, the whirr of a helicopter overhead, a laugh - creates an illusion that you’re actually on the run. You could say that the majority of songs from The Dark Side of the Moon ‘work better in the context of the album,’ which is true: almost all of the songs aren’t meant to be played on their own, but I’ve always enjoyed “On the Run” by itself, and the same goes for “The Happiest Days of Our Lives,” the intro to “Another Brick in the Wall Part II” on The Wall. These are both interlude-style tracks that have been given such care that only a complex atmosphere band could have given that they shine plenty on their own. They are both among my five favourite Pink Floyd songs.\n\nI guess what I’m about to say makes no sense since I just espoused several paragraphs about it, but I find this popular album boring to think about: it truly feels like there are no interesting takes to be had about it, or Pink Floyd as a whole. Perhaps the biggest limitation for a band like this with someone who thought he had as much to say as Rogers Waters is that the majority of their songs play like this: Roger Waters going ‘This thing is bad!’ and then David Gilmour dropping a 5-minute guitar solo.\n\nA-""]",4.00 stars

Zachvision,"[""Pink Floyd’s 1973 album Dark Side Of The Moon is no doubt the most iconic rock album of all time, and for good reason. Its cover art is instantly recognizable, and the songs within the somewhat simple-looking facade for the album are nothing short of spectacular. Forming in 1965 as “The Pink Floyd Sound” the bands’ original members, most notably Syd Barrett, would produce 2 albums until 1968 when Syd was kicked out of the band for schizophrenia complications due to excessive LSD use. Though gone, Barrett was definitely not forgotten, with themes of insanity and isolation playing major parts on Dark Side and their latter album Wish you were here; which serves as a melancholy tribute to the crazed Guitarist. Dark side’s first track “Speak to me” creatively sets the scene for what’s to come; with a bass drum replicating a heartbeat, followed by a conglomerate of clocks, cash registers, coins, and maniacal laughter, all preludes to songs featured later on the album such as Time, Money, and Brain Damage. “Breathe” acts as a blended part two, and in my opinion is one of the crowning tracks on this album, particularly showcasing the fantastic work of drummer Nick Mason and Keyboardist Richard Wright by using escalating scales of organs. Described by Bassist and creative ringleader Roger Waters, “(Dark Side) is about all the pressures and difficulties and questions that crop up in one’s life and create anxiety, and the potential you have to solve them or to choose the path that you’re going to walk” Though the album’s narrative explores the life of a rock star, (Money, On the run) it also touches upon much deeper, philosophical topics such as War (us and them), existentialism (time) death (the great gig in the sky) and insanity (brain damage). Somewhat ironically, Dark Side’s most successful single “Money”, which is a snide attack on the greedy rockstar lifestyle, permeating sexy guitar and sax solos, and a earworm of a baseline, would come back to haunt the rockers after the very song boosted them to superstardom; making it the only song in the 7/8 time signature to ever spend 741 weeks on the charts. It’s truly a surprise Money was this successful in radio performance, as Pink Floyd are notorious for their psychedelic, avant-garde, 20 minute plus ballads (the songs “Atom Heart Mother”, “Echoes”, and “Shine on you crazy diamond” are great examples). Many find Dark Side to be a tough listen, with none of the songs able to stand out on their own. That being said, it’s not an album full of songs, rather an experience to be indulged in. Personally, I recommend listening to the entire album in full, as it makes the experience seamlessly special. Recorded in an 8 month period at Abbey Road’s legendary Studio B, Roger Waters took it upon himself to interview people working around the studio such as the doorman to use as disembodied dialogue throughout the album. At the time of recording, Paul McCartney was recording the “Red Rose Speedway” album with Wings. Waters asked Paul a few questions recording their conversation on his 8 track recorder, thinking listeners would enjoy a hidden Beatle cameo, however, his responses were “trying to hard to be funny” and were therefore scrapped. Another interesting story is the conception of “the great gig in the sky” when a 25 -year-old session singer Claire Torry walked into the room and sung her soul out.

KARTERVANGOGHZ,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""— A fraction of my journey through the eminent RYM Top 100 as of 2021: The Dark Side of the Moon at #7\n\nThis album’s popularity in recent years is more apparent on t-shirts than it is on actual print. How many people have you seen donning that classic triangular prism? I’ll give an anecdote. I remember a classmate in middle school had worn a hoodie with the likes of Pink Floyd on it. In my head I contemplated asking if they had actually listened to the record or not. Future me is ever thankful I tucked that thought away in the back of my mind. What’s worse than someone coming up to you and querying “Hey, do you know the band on your shirt? What’s your favorite Pink Floyd song? Can you name three Pink Floyd songs?” I look back and laugh at how much I cared about what other people wore.\n\nNevertheless, that rainbow light beam is iconic. Even if you haven’t listened to Floyd, you are guaranteed to have seen it. Though, the consequence of an outwardly emblematic album is the daunting expectation that is put onto it. My first listen oh so long ago had me stupefied. I anticipated that it’d sound different... I originally believed that it would be similar to the The Beatles. Both equally iconic musical figures. But the intermingled tightrope act David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Roger Waters play of silence and sound is its own classic.\n\nThere is quite mixed reception. I mean, I do follow people with widely different palettes than I, but I saw a great chunk of scores lower than 3.0 stars. The Dark Side of the Moon is the rocking of gentle, delicate waves against an inanimate vessel. A mellow noise that you only briefly notice. It is a sound that floats away from the foreground the more focused you are on a pastime. Factually, there isn’t much substance in each song. Even prominent tracks like ‘Us and Them’ and ‘Time’ are pretty non abrasive. But it's the fact that the sound is engaging. It envelopes you into a bubble of space wars and moon craters. At the same time, my love for The Dark Side of the Moon derives from safeness and nostalgia. I’ve had this release in my repertoire for years now and it is my go-to spacesuit when I wanna rocket off of this earth. To put it bluntly, there is something so forgettable about each track that I can listen to it again and again and get a new feeling out of it each time.\n\nI’ve stated beforehand on my Wish You Were Here review that Pink Floyd is a band you either love or hate. And it most definitely applies here.""]",5.00 stars
aaoi,"[""Classic album for a reason. Simple and relatable lyrics about things we all deal with, amazing production and instrumentals which are endlessly atmospheric and spacey. I haven't seen this discussed elsewhere, but I also like how the album - more specifically the A side - frames itself around the experience of a human life.\n\nSpeak to Me is the protagonist being born, Breathe is sort of a life advice - perhaps from a parent to their child, tracks 3-5 are this person getting caught in the rush of life and eventually dying finding their time has been misspent. The Side B covers more abstract, man-made topics as if the narrator's death has allowed them to see the bigger picture with more clarity."", '']",

This segues perfectly into Breathe, a gorgeous song about being alive, albeit a bittersweet one. On the Run is a hodgepodge of experimental noise, essentially the reason this album needs to be listened to on headphones. Time is perfect; with an incredible alarm start, slow ticking buildup, explosive guitar solo, and brilliant lyrics, there are few better Floyd songs. Great Gig in the Sky carries itself with some gorgeous female vocalizations, and feels like a trip around the galaxy. Money is the greed song, with a killer bass riff and some great sardonic lyrics. Us and Them is the second most gorgeous song on the album, with some smooth saxophone and relaxed pacing but a powerful and life-affirming chorus. Any Colour You Like is one of the best instrumentals Pink Floyd has. Brain Damage begins the finale well with another great chorus and some really unsettling lyrics. Eclipse lets the album sail off into the stratosphere, with the heartbeat from the start of the album slowly fading off into the night.']",5.00 stars
SnailBob2,"[""Not actually their best album, but a great solid record with no bad cuts. I always think of this as sort of a turning point in rock - it's honestly very modern sounding. Stylistically Floyd had been on this for a while, and so had a few other artists in the prog-and-psych realm, but it can't really be disputed how solid of a statement this album is.\n\nIt's atmospheric, spacy, emotional & grand but decidedly eschews jam. There are fewer notes, but more textures building these massive structures out of what notes are played. For the most part it's not very blues or 'n' roll, despite having plenty of pentatonic it ends up leaning as much into jazz, modern classical sort of territory as to the influences evoked.

kylejohnson7,"['Ok, so you know how every class has those 1-2 kids that don\'t talk at all? Like to anyone or the teacher? They just kinda sit there and don\'t really do anything, yet they get A\'s on every test? Yeah, that\'s how I\'d describe me (except not the \'get all As on every test\' part). So, being one of those people, I know that all of us always have something to say. But, we just need some incentive to do so. We would rather observe than to speak, instead of just being one of those people that love to hear themselves talk all the time. For me, I use this website to talk about my opinions on stuff (mostly music), and it\'s great. But, outside RYM, I\'m pretty much that silent kid. But, I assure you, if anyone asks me a specific question, I will give them a well thought out opinion on that subject, and not hold back.\n\nSo why did I tell this pointless story about myself to a bunch of strangers? Because I feel that\'s the way this album has been rated over the years. The silent kid, including myself, just nods and says, ""Yeah, Dark Side is the best album in all of music! If God\'s exists, Dark Side is proof!"" Yet, if asked privately, the kid may say the following, ""It\'s overrated! Genesis is WAY better! What the hell are they even trying to preach! I hate the album cover, BRING BACK THE COW!""\n\nThis album has SO much acclaim that it has become an unwritten rule, that\'s apart of society, to not say anything bad about it. If you do, you are shamed beyond belief. You are immediately judged and given ""the"" look. The look of utter disgust, utter contempt, and utter distaste. At least, that\'s how it works at my school.\n\nBased on how this review\'s going, you may think that I hate this album with a passion. I honestly don\'t. I think it\'s a damn good album, but is it the masterpiece that everyone makes it out to be? No. And that\'s okay.\n\nThe number one thing I do love about this album is the concept. The concept is amazing. I absolutely love the way Floyd constructed this album. Each of the five songs, on each side, flow between one another and the album begins and ends in a heartbeat. They could not have hit this out of the park any better than that. In addition, the themes they explore are insane. I don\'t mean insane as in good, I mean literally insane. I mean seriously, how does a band explore so many concepts such as existentialism, conflict, greed, the passage of time, death, insanity, hedonism, AND nihilism, yet have the album remain so cohesive and inspiring at the same time. That in itself is incredible. The depth to Floyd\'s music is unmatched and that continues to be the case.\n\nNext, the song writing on this album deserves all the praise it garners. ""Time"" is a fucking masterpiece of the entire English language. Like holy shit. There is no doubt that millions of people have had some sort of epiphany or existential crisis about life because of that one song. I know I sure have. And ""Time"" is just the highlight among the nine other incredibly written songs on here. So yeah. On a side note, a friend of mine told me in 8th grade that ""Money"" is about Donald Trump. I laughed and shrugged it off, at the time, as if it was nothing. Nowadays, there is no doubt in my mind that may be the case. There has to be a conspiracy theory on that because the similarities between the lyrics and Trump are undeniable.\n\nNext, the music. What is there really to say? It\'s Pink Floyd. Their musicianship in off the charts. So I\'m just going to state some highlights of mine. For one, the whole ""Us and Them"". Okay, next. The way David Gilmour changes time signatures mid guitar solo in the middle of ""Money"" is mind blowing. Obviously, Clare Torry\'s vocals on ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" are inspiring and, if you\'ve listened to this album enough, there is no doubt in my mind that you\'ve tried to recreating those vocals in your car. Probably not to great success, but it\'s the thought that counts people. That\'s what I tell myself when I attempt such a feat. Next, the transition between ""Brain Damage"" into ""Eclipse"" is one of the best I\'ve heard. Nothing beats, ""Fly On a Windshield"" into ""Broadway Melody of 1974"" by Genesis but, this is a close second. Lastly, the synthesizer solo intro to ""Any Colour You Like"" is incredible. The guitar solo at the end is great too, as always. But, that intro gets me every time.\n\nSo, now you may be thinking, ""Why does this only have four stars if you give this album so much praise?"" I\'m getting there. Like every long convoluted anime, this album suffers from one central thing: filler. Why the hell is ""On the Run"" on here? For that matter, why is ""Any Colour You Like"" even on here too? They add nothing to this album\'s main driving force: the concept. These are just instrumentals that show off the bands technical prowess. Now, if you\'re into that stuff, I have no problem against it. As a prog nerd, I have no choice but to respect that opinion. Honestly, I just think it\'s hilarious that even in music, stories have unnecessary bullshit mixed into them that serve no purpose. I thought that was only in anime, but I\'m clearly wrong as Dark Side isn\'t the only famous concept album that suffers from this. For example, take The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway by Genesis. That album has four to five instrumentals throughout that album. Now you know why I give them a pass? Because the album contains twenty-three tracks. These four to five tracks actually have a purpose: to ease the listener between the songs that actually explain the most complicated story ever written (thanks Peter Gabriel). Here, with only ten tracks, you better hope that album uses all ten of them to their full potential. This album only uses eight.\n\nThat\'s not the only reason for the four star rating. And this isn\'t even Pink Floyd\'s fault. It\'s just that my expectations for this album were high beyond high. Like, Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters high (and that\'s pretty damn high if you know what I mean). I expected all ten tracks, back when I was a sophomore, to be undeniably life-changing songs. Instead, I\'m left with four of those, and a life-changing concept that will always hold a special place in my heart. In the end, I\'m more than happy with what I got.\n\nI still love Dark Side of the Moon. It was essential to my music journey and education when I first started out. I will forever be grateful to the album for that. Now, with some more years of experience under my belt, I know that this album is great, but it is flawed. But hey, it\'s Pink Floyd. They wouldn\'t been regarded as one of the greatest bands of all time if they only had one classic. And spoiler: I like those ones more (except The Wall).']",4.00 stars

Most of the album is the kind of music that happens when you smoke too much pot. It seriously sounds like they were high when they were recording it. Most of the time they sing at the speed of a snail and with the emotional capacity of a rock, before breaking out into a screaming chorus or going into a climax with the instruments. The instrumentation saves the album. Their rhythm is slow and steady, and they overlay progressively more instruments as a song goes on. The instrumental climaxes are down right good, musically complex and interesting to listen to. The Electronic Keyboard climax in Any Color You Like is particularly good. Unfortunately this comes bundled with the vocals of sleepy pot heads, so I have to give this album a 2/5. Unplugging my headphones brought immediate relief.']",2.00 stars
wesanity,"['I honestly have no idea what to add about this album that hasn\'t already been said, as the iconic color prism that dons the front cover has loomed over all music discussion for nearly the last 50 years. Oftentimes regarding as the best album ever by mainstream music publications and its greatness constantly touted by music lovers all over, it can be easy to just get sick of hearing about this thing.\n\nBut ""Dark Side of the Moon"" really is a phenomenal album. There is not a single lull in the tracklist. Nothing overstays its welcome. And yet, the album allows itself to be wildly expansive, completely ignoring typical 3-minute long pop song structures. I have a distinct memory when I was 13, just starting to get into music: My parents were sharing their CD collection with me in the family room, and my dad pulled out the immediately recognizable cover of this album, and played ""Money."" I was instantly grabbed with the groovy bassline rolling along to the odd jump of a 7/4 beat, complete with raucous guitar solos and a saxophone solo. Oddly enough, it took me years to actually listen to the album in full for the first time, as the constant praise and discussion of it made it feel like an insurmountable beast that I just wouldn\'t ""get.""\n\nThat\'s the thing, though. For as out there and experimental as ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is, it is incredibly accessible. There\'s a reason it has the stereotype of being the album that showed people through multiple generations that music could be more than simple pop songs. It has a tight runtime of 42 minutes, and it packs so many interesting musical ideas in without feeling obtuse or overly simplistic. The songs are all distinct, and yet flow into each other so well. ""Breathe (In the Air)"" is a chilled-out, spacey opener whose musical themes and motifs get loosely reflected throughout the whole album, notably in the expansive and explosive ""Time,"" and the triumphant ""The Great Gig in the Sky,"" boasting an incredible wordless vocal solo that no doubt is an ascension to musical heaven.\n\nMeanwhile, ""Us and Them"" in 8 minutes takes you through so many interesting changes it never gets stale, despite its simple construction. Of course, the chorus is absolutely grand. And to top it off, it flows seamlessly into ""Any Colour You Like,"" which takes the previous track into space with a glorious night sky of synthesizer. Even here, you can here the echoes of the base musical motif from ""Breathe (In the Air)"" floating around. And to the very end of the closing track ""Eclipse"" it just flows naturally.\n\nI know this album can feel imposing and terrifying to actually listen to given how much cultural baggage is wrapped up in it, but it really is easy to get into, and easy to love.', 'https://listnd.com/review/17367']",5.00 stars

bluenile_21,"['The most interesting thing about The Dark Side of the Moon is how obvious it becomes that Floyd used to be a psych-rock band - I mean, listen to it, it\'s all cyclical rhythms and gliding guitars and pithy half-formed pseudo-philosophical ""poetry"". Made me feel right in my comfort zone, at least in that regard. But the album itself is not amazing, and that concept (of Dark Side of the Moon sitting up there with Sgt. Pepper and Blonde On Blonde) seems to be more of a general \'willing into existence\' than an objective, measurable truth. The songwriting is, you know, fine, but not even at Syd Barrett solo work level most of the time, and the sin of expelling him will haunt this album forever as their first worthy work post-Piper, at least for those who lean more psych than prog. Anyway, anyway, anyway. That\'s what this is, it\'s psych-prog, and often unholy in that regard. The production is the real star here, and that was all done by the band themselves, so thank god that at least it\'s not a Visconti/Bowie/Iggy situation. Undoubtedly the LP is successful, it just doesn\'t go to the moon and back. More like to Pentangle\'s Basket of Light and back, or some other such half-psych half-whatever work that were so deeply critically popular in \'68-69, when this album probably should have come out. Unbeknownst to most at the time, psych and prog were a back to back deal - I mean, re: prog, has anything beat Crimson King? No? Thought not. Knew not. Anyway, it\'s too American and much too commercial for a band like Floyd, who came onto the scene with \'Interstellar Overdrive\', \'The Gnome\' and \'Bike\'. I swear I heard David Gilmour say, ""don\'t give me that goody-good bullshit,"" as if he were some sort of cowboy ... um, excuse me, boys, but what happened to Grimble Crumble?\n\n5 February 2021.']",4.00 stars

Fabro10,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'After years and years - particularly after a long time of standing for The Wall, an album which I now recognize is 90% heavily diluted smoke and only 10% actual genius - I\'ve come to accept that Pink Floyd\'s big four albums of the mid-late \'70s are ranked by this site in the correct order, descending with time. The Dark Side of the Moon works a tad better as a whole-listen experience than Wish You Were Here, which in turn is much more preciously atmospheric music than Animals (which I very seriously considered for this list: ""Dogs"" and ""Pigs"" are very solid work and one of prog-rock most tasteful responses to the rise of punk), and The Wall is by far the most inconsistent of them all. I\'m not a fan of their earlier work but I\'m willing to give the benefit of the doubt to all those albums (I could be just missing the point when I get irrationally angry at the masturbatory experimental psychedelic stuff) except for Meddle, which I\'m more confident to say is embarrassingly overrated (If ""Echoes"" really sounds like divine music to you then you\'re probably beyond salvation; keep listening to Steven Wilson and The Mars Volta).\n\nMy theory has always been that the main source of genius here, or at least the key source of it, is Alan Parsons. Not Roger Waters, not David Gilmour. All these new detailed and imaginative textures, this sonic palette that layers beautiful beams of light ones over the others above darker backgrounds, that\'s Parson\'s main addition to this band of talented musicians that, however, had been lost for some years. The whole level of sophistication at which the band recorded and produced their music changed from Meddle to this one, nothing here sounds dadrock-y anymore. Parsons is even the guy responsible for getting Clare Torry to sing in ""The Great Gig in the Sky"". Couldn\'t be more transparent! Waters and Gilmour have their moments, of course. Waters, with all his pompous metaphors and stuff, sometimes hits right in the target (the lyrics to ""Eclipse"" are the perfect thing coming at the right time). Gilmour, although he gingerly paces his additions through the album without calling attention to himself, did write one of the best guitar solos I\'ve heard in my entire life for this record (it\'s, naturally, the one that obstreperously comes in at the 3:29 minute mark during ""Time""). But the album\'s flaws are generally their fault as well, Parsons\' had no way to fix them: Gilmour\'s vocals are usually too on-the-nose, the album\'s flow at the beginning is a tad too low-key (of the first ten minutes of the album seven are interlude-like stuff), and Waters\' occasional corny lyrics stand out, among other things. The compositions themselves can have their weaknesses too, for they are repetitive (excessively many i-IV progressions), waaaay too reliant on emotionally-ambiguous climaxes, and ultimately kind of forgettable, for too many listens are necessary to become able to distinguish some songs from the others. This album, in the end, simply lacks a big meaning. It dissolves as fastly as it came into existence. It is all \'in your head\'.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is commonly referred to as the kind of album that is truly an album; the sequencing of this music elevates it, the flow is so satisfying it gives the impression it could not have worked any other way. In a theoretical way, I don\'t quite get why it is that the different pieces had to be divided into independent tracks - precisely one of the interesting ideas that progressive rock had brought forward was the concept of unifying different musical sections into single tracks to give this idea of continuity, and here Pink Floyd just get rid of it for no clear reason - but that\'s probably a very lame complaint. In the practice it all shines: The way the first few sounds of ""Speak to Me"" flow into ""Breath"" is more than just clever. The cathartic way in which ""Time"" dissolves, leaving the perfect piano notes of the fifth track to come in, so softly and beautifully that it\'s impossible not to hear both tracks in a row, even if that was not your intention in the first place. Listen to the organ that opens ""Us and Them"", and think about how it feels like just a continuation of ""Money"".\n\nBy the way, ""Money"" is almost idiotically overrated. Let\'s cut with the bullshit, shall we? Boring groove. If this is your idea of funk you are probably an incel who deserves it. Gilmour is at his most annoying, almost as much as Waters has ever gotten to be, and his hook just doesn\'t work because it\'s too fucking damn complex - how\'s that such a long and non-melodic line is supposed to be catchy goes beyond my understanding. Same as with ""Have a Cigar"" from their following record, there was a need to have a commercial cut to promote the album, and they forced it in. When your album is supposed to flow naturally, that\'s a bit of a bad deal. Hurts more than it adds. I do like the sax solo, though, not gonna lie. And the thing of using cash register sounds as percussion is... well, that\'s at least an idea.\n\nThere are plenty of sections that do flow naturally all along the record. Sections that I love because, even if I have trouble focusing on the album for 40 minutes due to my short attention span, they still call my attention every time they play. The transition from the chorus of ""Time"" to the guitar solo, like a rush of hormones flowing to your head, is one of the most impactful moments on the record, and it\'s followed by a chord progression that triggers the entrance of the gorgeous backing choir. This is the one section of music in the album that doesn\'t feel brainy at all: it\'s just an earnest outpour of emotion, something that can\'t be stopped and has to be let out. Another great moment comes with the chorus of ""Us and Them"", which would be a perfect section of music if it wasn\'t for the sudden C major chord that in theory offers cathartic \'closure\'. It does not conclude any shit, it just sounds awful. It breaks the momentum. But let\'s not focus on that mistake, let\'s focus on those space-like piano and guitar notes, that, at the moment just before the chorus comes in, start creating tension without actually playing any single chord that implies tension (first happens around the 2:43 minute mark, the signal is that loud bass piano note). This is bloodily brilliant, and the impatient monumental sound of the chorus itself lives up to this created tension (LimedIBagels once described The Dark Side of the Moon as an album that gives the feeling \'like you\'re running away from something\', and sections of music like those are the ones that make me understand that description).\n\nMore captivating stuff: The bent and then released guitar note in ""Brain Damage"", the very first synth sounds from ""Any Color You Like"", the rise of the organ at the beginning of the second verse of ""Breath"", the slide guitars during ""Breath"", the lovely first sax solo from ""Us and Them"", the piano solo in that same song, the sonic raindrops that make the intro to ""Time"" (Mason\'s rototoms: fuck yeah!), the album\'s last couple of lyrics. All these musical ideas bear witness to the remarkable level of care at which Pink Floyd was working on when writing these songs. They did forget about the whole, but the small details, the immediate parts, are all beautifully presented. The whole is covered by the fact that all the small parts flow seamlessly, so there\'s no room to notice the general lack of purpose.\n\nSumming up my thoughts on The Dark Side of the Moon gets hard. Very overrated record. Very beautiful music. Very annoying concepts. Very inspired execution. I guess in the \'70s you could get away with that because the product would almost end up being iconic if you tried to reach far enough. My thanks to Alan Parsons, and my thanks to Clare Torry. The most unique of things, a piece of art that stands as the face of what a ""serious"" approach to art is but which, after closer inspection, cannot be said in good faith to be all heavy-hearted. When I hear ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", that overwhelming entrance of the vocals, I cannot imagine any other thing but that Torry was taking it like a bit of a joke. In some interviews, the band members claim that, even though they instructed her not to sing any lyrics, she started singing something like \'Ooh-aah, baby, baby, yeah\'. Something dumb. And they had all fun. You get to art more easily when you\'re not thinking about making serious stuff and, instead, you just let go and explore the possibilities you have. It\'s terrific music because it\'s not trying, it is run by intuition and intuition alone.\n\n\'There is no dark side of the moon really. As a matter of fact, it\'s all dark.\'\n\n9.0']",4.50 stars

Probably not when you think about it.\n\nThere\'s no two ways about it, The Dark Side Of The Moon was a ground breaking album, and with it Pink Floyd effectively changed the way that we listen to rock music. Like the other huge band of the era, Led Zeppelin, Floyd managed to conquer the charts without the aid of hit singles, and suddenly the underground was overground, and we were all wombling free. It was no longer cool to listen to music that was released in the seven inch single format, and to enjoy a single that actually charted could get you laughed out of the student common room. Even four and a half decades later, there are those that still cling to the notion that the more obscure something is, the better it gets, which of course is absolute rubbish.\n\nWith its use of samples, loops, fiddly electronics, and lyrics on the human condition, The Dark Side Of The Moon sounds a world away from the universe of orcs, goblins and wise old men that the majority of other progressive rock bands were obsessed with, which inevitably made Pink Floyd a damn site more progressive than most other bands that carried the same tag. Sure, occasionally their pretensions would get the better of them, and there are certainly times that they would obscure a great song with all kinds of instrumental experimentation, just so it wouldn\'t sound like a \'normal\' rock song, but you can\'t deny the quality of the lyrics. For me the best tracks on The Dark Side Of The Moon are ""Brain Damage"" and ""Eclipse"", where there seems to finally be some kind of compromise between the great tunes and the desire to sound as experimental as possible.\n\nOf course The Dark Side Of The Moon has suffered the same fate as Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, in that its heavy weight reputation as \'an important album\' has ultimately been its undoing, and that it has now become so familiar to so many music fans, that it has lost almost lost all of its impact and its ability to surprise unless you\'re somehow hearing it for the first time.\n\nThe Dark Side Of The Moon is unarguably an important album, and one of the key milestones in rock music. It\'s also an album that has been re-released every time there has been any microscopic improvement in audio technology, which means that it is promoted yet again. As good as The Dark Side Of The Moon is, there are better Pink Floyd albums out there that don\'t get a quarter of the airplay or press coverage that the material on this album has had. Personally it would be no hardship to me if I was restricted to hearing The Dark Side Of The Moon just once a year.\n\nOh, and if you try and synch The Dark Side Of The Moon up with The Wizard of Oz, you really should get a life.']",3.50 stars
xmatanuix,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""I'm not even sure where to start with this album so I'll just start with the first half. The A Side of this album quickly envelopes the listener in its slow, bouncy basslines and floaty synthesizers that more or less instantly make me think of those scenes in shows where they're floating through endless space, and that's how it feels to listen to the most of the album. There are some major highs to it as a whole, and subjectively, one or two lows as well.\n\nOne of the most notable highs from the A Side is the solo in 'Time', which blows me away a little more with every listen. However, the vocal part in the following track feels a little drawn out for my taste, which takes me out of it for a second.\n\n'Breathe' reintroduces the bassline from the second part in 'Time' which is also in the second to last track on the album. Personally I thoroughly enjoy the motif and wish that more modern artists would do similar things, it makes the album feel much more like one big piece made up of single tracks and brings it all together very nicely.\n\nThe B Side starts with 'Money' a classic track that, despite its very high quality songwriting, feels kind of out of place on this album to me. The first half of the album builds up this very calm, trippy atmosphere which is then partly undone by this song's funky and high energy sound.\n\nFinally, the last 3 tracks tie up the album in an overwhelmingly good crescendo. I'm not sure I can really describe what makes me feel so strongly about these final tracks but its almost as if the entire album builds up to this peak, and because of this it feels incredibly powerful to me.\n\nOverall an immensely good album. Deserves its high rating and an album I find myself returning to over and over""]",4.50 stars

KQKHereComesThePain,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Modern life is a bunch of bullshit. It has always been bullshit. You wake up. You have breakfast. You travel to work. You either get stuck in traffic in the car, or on the buss, or you are subject to train delays. You work nine to five in an office for a company you don\'t care about. You go to lunch. You watch people from afar. You go back to work. More work and more apathy. You are just that little bit late coming home. You have dinner. You barely have time to spend with your loved one, if you even have one. Go to bed. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThat\'s the definition of madness. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. Maybe that is the English way, a silent desperation for things to be different whilst sticking rigidly to routine so as not to rock the boat. Trust me, I\'m English, I know this too well because I do it too well. It drives me up the wall, and this has been ongoing since I turned from a child without responsibility into a man who suddenly had to do everything. Which means, yes, I\'ve been mad for years.\n\nSurely Pink Floyd were no different. After all, come 1973 when they released their most famous album and one of the most popular of all time - The Dark Side of the Moon - they had changed quite a bit since their early days. Syd Barrett was no longer in the band, and with his departure, his fascination with childhood regression and innocence was replaced gradually with a growing cynicism that would be taken to extremes by the end of the decade. It is an album whose concept only appears high and mighty to those who either revere it too much, or those who don\'t get it.\n\nReally, The Dark Side of the Moon\'s concept is pretty damn simple to understand. It\'s about how modern life drives people barmy. The true wonder is how seamless it is, how easy going the music is, how it slips through difficult and arguably taboo subject matter with calm and relaxing music. You can just put the album on and its forty-two minutes fly by, yet you can still remember every moment. You can still decipher every note.\n\nThe opening Speak to Me offers the first piece of the puzzle. Every sound effect you will come across on this album is played back, from the heartbeat, to the cash machines, to the laughter, to the dialogue, to this sense of foreboding tension. You hear the sound of a lady screaming as if about to meet her untimely demise, before a whoosh sweeps the listener into a trance with Breathe, one of the best album openers ever. It sounds like literally coming into being, Roger Waters\' bass thumping on octaves, David Gilmour\'s slippery guitars against Nick Mason\'s jazzy, cool-breeze of the drums, how Richard Wright\'s keys just soar and levitate. The slide guitars that pop up occasionally. And then, after a brief bridge, comes harmonised vocals that act as a narcotic against thinking too much and living too fast:\n\nCome the second verse, the music sounds a little more dynamic, much more intense as Gilmour implores the listener to ""rabbit run/dig that hole in the sun"". There are more organ and synth noises that subtly creep into the mix, before a repetition of the more bittersweet bridge, as Gilmour warns the listener that they\'re ""rac[ing] towards an early grave.""\n\nAnd with that, the game is afoot. On the Run is another interlude, this time one that is much more kinetic and full of more solid movement than the free-flowing Breathe. Its entire existence is to serve as a furthering of the album\'s concept - you hear announcements of planes leaving, you even hear one, you hear businessmen laughing and joking as they wait to go on board. All the while, the repetition of it all drives home the point well - for me, I use the bus all the time to get to work, and it\'s almost as if the monotony of the journey was written for On the Run, not the other way around. A precursor to Waters\' fascination with crashing planes leads to a mass explosion and a whimpering ambience for the last thirty seconds, before an alarm clock sounds and scares the hell out of me.\n\nTick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock. The clock is going on and on in Time. A single note strikes, drums avoiding snares at all costs, twinkles from Wright again. It\'s pretty dark and foreboding, uncertain of how things will go. It feels like millennia before the main chord sequence comes, and when it does, Mason signals the song proper with a simple fill. Offbeat guitars enter, the bass starts to slink along, the keys start to decorate. And Gilmour opens his mouth, more intense and agitated than on Breathe, with his guitar bending and sliding in a delicious fashion, before the sound of backing singers, quiet and minimal, and Wright\'s voice provide further exposition, being the messenger to Waters\' doom and gloom: ""no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun"".\n\nThe guitar solo that follows is one of the best of all time. Gilmour bends, he snarls, he cries, he lets it all loose against the clock. It\'s a monumental achievement in playing, and try as I might to play it or cover it, I can\'t. The bends are insane. After it roars out of life, Gilmour is back behind the mic, going on and on about things are the same except you\'re older - ""shortness of breath/one step closer to death"". Even Wright sounds tired, ""hanging on in quiet desperation is the English Way"" - that lyric right there is so bloody true - and he runs out of steam, slowing down, ""thought I had so much more to say"".\n\nThe reprise of Breathe then drives the point further home how interconnected these songs are, how the narrator of Time is now breathing, coming to the same epiphanies as the previous one. There is pleasure in Gilmour\'s voice as he ""warms [his] bones beside the fire"", before almost warning against the ""iron bell"", the ""broken magic spell"". An organ note of Bm hangs in the balance, until...\n\nRichard Wright behind a piano. Since his death, there has been a lot of retrospective praise for him. Most of it is due to his work on songs like The Great Gig in the Sky, which he got a credit for, and so he bloody should have gotten. It\'s easily the most intense and cathartic song across the entire album, and it doesn\'t have any words - aside from the spoken word sample. It starts off with introducing the slide guitar and the bass against the piano, sticking first with Bm to F to A# to Am w/ added F. The main chord progression, Gm to C, brings a sense of familiarity to the piece. Another bridge - F, A#, D#, C7, F - with that infamous sample;\n\nAnd I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don\'t mind.\nWhy should I be frightened of dying?\nThere\'s no reason for it, you\'ve gotta go sometime.\n\nAnd then another - A#, D#, A#. And then boom. The song explodes into life, sticking rigidly to its main two chord sequence. Session singer Clare Torry, who was paid a measly fee for the song and since went on to get a handsome cut of the album\'s sales later on down the line, belts out in a series of vocalisations that do border on wankery at first. With each listen, it\'s clear this voice is the sound of death and turmoil. The gradual layers of organs complimenting more drum fills, slide guitars going crazy, the bass just cruising along. Toward the end, the familiar sound of her hitting the G note so high and so mightily, as on the album intro, ushers forth a new chord sequence - D, C#, F#, B - directly leading back to the intro. This time, no slides, no drums; just piano, bass and Torry\'s horror as conveyed in her singing.\n\nThis goes on for close to two minutes. It\'s a long goodnight. Waters bass playing is also contemplative, sometimes playing octaves and slinking along. Wright\'s playing is fantastic, measured and controlled, enough to rival classical composers\' chops. A woman whispers how she\'s never been afraid of dying. Honestly, I\'m not either.\n\nCash registers clinking and clanking in an odd time signature. Palm muted bass and guitar. Drums pushing forth from the ether with echoing chord strikes, and more organ play. A sleazy number named, appropriately enough, Money. Ironically, a song denouncing the power that comes with wealth - the nonsense of buying a football team - ended up being a huge hit for the band. People would come to their shows just to hear it and leave. In a way, it\'s fitting, because it\'s so easy to misinterpret. The band almost know how much this album will make, and are both impressed and horrified by money. How it makes governments do arguably unethical things with it, whether its payouts or obscene tax rates (""keep your hands off of my stacks"" may read as greed, and it does, but bare in mind the progressive income tax in Britain at one point was 95%. Yes, 1 for you, 19 for me, indeed). The song revels in its own success, complete with Dick Parry\'s saxophone and its cock rock, shuffling bridge sections.\n\nAnother classic Gilmour solo that is interrupted by a build-up. Jittery, scratchy guitars against hollowing organs are further anchored by Waters\' trebly bass and Mason\'s tom fills, before finally settling back into the groove. Gilmour\'s guitar mocking the wealthy and, with harsh hindsight, the band itself. People were shocked at the lengths the band went to in regards to discussing their contempt for the music industry, but you can hear it on Money, how self-aware and cynical the band are, conveyed through their music. They ain\'t riding the gravy train on Money, they\'re driving it, and the last verse conveys this perfectly, as Gilmour fades out with some vocalisations. The drums are easy going. Then, more soundbites about fighting and conflict, and appropriately enough -\n\nUs and Them. A calming, unnervingly quiet song against the backdrop of lush saxophones, spiralling synth work, repetitious ground bass, and silky guitars. Lyrics about the hypocrisies of war and the generals leading the common man to his death, not unlike politicians driving the working class into the ground. At several points across the song\'s nearly eight minute track length, there are ascensions in volume across backing vocals, crashing cymbals and loud barre chords. There is also another vocal sample during the song\'s bridge section:\n\nI mean, they\'re not gonna kill ya\nSo if you give \'em a quick short, sharp, shock\nThey won\'t do it again. Dig it?\nI mean he get off lightly, \'cause I would\'ve given him a thrashing\nI only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion, but really\nI mean good manners don\'t cost nothing do they, eh?\n\nAnd from the aftermath of this battle comes a proposition. Out of the settling dust. Any Colour You Like bursts it in all of its Technicolor glory. Ostensibly a jam with the same chord progression as Breathe, down a whole tone (Dm to G), it showcases Richard Wright\'s importance to the band. It\'s the closest thing to funk the album has, and Wright\'s synthesizers muddy the mix with intent. The rhythm section is tight and muscular, whereas Gilmour\'s guitar is slippery and gorgeous, falling out of place at times. The track gets further and further into the groove, and after some scat singing and a mini solo from Gilmour, the closing of Breathe - at least in terms of sequence of notes, again down a tone - sours the composition. And so it goes that the listener bumps their head and thus has...\n\nBrain Damage. The soft arpeggios of the open chord, against some bends and slides. The bass playing octaves ever so softly. Mason\'s hi hat delicately pressed at the right time. Roger Waters, the tall and imposing self-appointed leader of Pink Floyd, opens his mouth for the first time and has the last word toward the end of the record. An ode to lunacy and crumbling self-identity, Brain Damage is the logical conclusion to the album. The narrator(s) are going insane (""the lunatic is in my head"", complete with mad laughter). The two choruses, again, are subtle uplifts and crescendos. Ride cymbals, guitar strums, organs, backing singers. Both times, Waters looks forward to the listener joining him as they both go insane, as they both (eventually) become two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl. Also includes a juicy album title drop.\n\nEventually, with no warning, the Eclipse occurs. A thrashing away with no abandon and an epic, yet miniscule, closing to the record as Waters pulls out one of his favourite tricks: repetition. He\'d use this again on future songs such as Dogs. Here, the lyrics represent the end of the mental wellbeing of the listener, finally succumbing to modern life\'s insanity and being left in the lurch. (""all that you touch...and everything under the sun is in tune/but the sun is eclipsed by the moon"")\n\nYou hear that heartbeat again. A man\'s voice. ""There is no dark side of the moon really, matter of fact it’s all dark."" And then you find yourself compelled to press play again.\n\nAllow me to put this into perspective: The Dark Side of the Moon is not the best Pink Floyd album. The two albums that proceeded it are better. However, as much as I love Wish You Were Here and Animals more, it\'s clear to me that there was a pre-DSOTM and a post-DSOTM. It\'s that seminal of an album that it draws its own line in the sand of Pink Floyd\'s career, and indeed popular music at large. It was the nail in the coffin of the sixties in many ways. It was one of the first albums to finally proclaim, ""the dream and utopia failed and this is why, this is the result, and we need to do something about it"".\n\nIt was also the very first album by the band I checked out. Listening to this album for the first time in the dark, hearing it just oozing cool whilst conveying some damn near unsettling lyrical themes, was a cornerstone moment in my musical life.\n\nModern life sucked then and it sucks now.

Besides that, this album is outstanding. I don\'t know how to explain it, but this album has stool the test of time as one of the greatest, and if not the greatest LP release of all time. Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason put this album together after finding their sound after their 23 minute epic, Echoes.\n\nSIDE ONE:\n\nThe record opens with a heartbeat leading into a collage of sounds and motifs heard in the record, (Heartbeat, Money, Clare Torry, and studio talk ""I\'ve Been Mad For Fucking Years."") and it leads into Breathe(In The Air), an amazing opener to an amazing album. This talks about the birth of the protagonist, talking about the life ahead of this protagonist. ""Breathe...Breathe in the air. Don\'t be afraid to care. Leave, but don\'t leave me. Look around, choose your own ground, for long you live and high you fly, the smiles you\'ll give the tears you\'ll cry. All you touch and all you see, is all your life will ever be."" and talks about struggle in life with ""Run, Rabbit, Run! Dig that hole, forget the sun! When at-last the work is done, don\'t sit down it\'s time to dig another one."" The song continues on talking about life and it\'s long and winding road and throws the listener into a pulsating song, presenting another factor of life, Fear. To be more precise, Roger Waters\' fear of flying, as they have been touring via air to support Meddle. This song is a droning, pulsating song that shows fear as the song progresses and progresses towards the climax, which is the air vehicle crashing. Ambience is heard and in the back, clocks tick, and all of a sudden they all go off, jarring the listener back into reality. The song opens with a dark slow riff by Dave and a fantastic Nick Mason Rototom solo (which earns his credit on the track, making Time the only track credited to all members of PF on DSOTM). This song touches upon the quick reality of life, reminding the protagonist on how he/she has wasted the prime years of his life. ""Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home-town, waiting for someone or something to show you the way!"", and then Rick Wright\'s beautiful assuring voice comes in to join in, ""Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain, and you are young and life is long, but there is time to kill today..."" after this, David unleashes an ungodly guitar solo, which makes anyone cry when listening. It\'s one of his best works. The next verse is as if Dave makes a rebuttal towards Rick, ""You run and you run to catch up with the sun but it\'s sinking. Racing around to come up behind you again...Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death."" and Rick comes back with ""Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time, plans that either comes to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines."" I always took Time as a call and response song, as Dave warns, and Rick tries to soothe. Time ends with a lost thought and back into Breathe, about to introduce the greatest fear of all. Death. The Great Gig in The Sky\'s working title was originally, ""The Death Sequence."" Rick and Roger wanted to paint a beautiful ascension into the heavens, beginning with Rick Wright\'s piano work, the band comes in after a period of time where Rick plays a beautiful piece that leads into the climax, where singer, Clare Torry belt\'s her heart out, symbolizing the journey into the after life. It\'s beautiful, It\'s lyric less, but speaks so much. The song falls into the end of side one.\n\nSIDE TWO:\n""Cha Ching"" opens side two. Introducing ""Money"", a collage of money sounds in a 7/4 rhythm introduces the time signature of the song and beat. Then Roger\'s iconic bassline comes in for 4 bars and then the band comes in joining the rhythm. ""Money! Get away! Get a good job with more pay and you\'re okay!"" This line has always stood out\nto me as a the most damning line out of the entire song. We haven\'t been introduced yet, but we\'re told to fuck off and get a job! The song itself a great groovy song, It\'s really fun to jam out to. The song leads into the Saxophone solo by Dick Parry and into Dave\'s monstrous and loud wailing guitar solo, leading back into the main groove. ""Money, It\'s a crime, share it fairly but don\'t take a slice of my pie. Money, so they say, is the root of all evil today."" - Us And Them is introduced by Rick\'s organs and Dave\'s beautiful clean guitar tone. The song discusses how peaceful humans are and their unwillingness to fight, but due to the greediness of leaders and generals, they watch citizens fight for that ""Forward"" he cried from the rear, And the front rank died. The general sat and the lines on the map, moved from side to side!"" This song is very very soothing, the use of Dick Parry\'s soft but powerful saxophone work, and the soft vocal work by David Gilmour. It reaches a final climax and goes onto Any Colour You Like. Another Rick song, which primarily is based off of Rick Wrights Organs and Moog keys. It\'s a very groovy song, which basically tells the viewer to take advantage of the life their given. I can\'t really exclude of the rest of the band too because they make this song even better. Brain Damage is then introduced with a guitar rhythm and Roger\'s introducing line... ""The Lunatic is on the grass."" This song is an ode to their long lost member, Syd Barrett, who had fallen into lunacy due to extensive LSD use and developing Schizophrenia. Eclipse really doesn\'t require an explanation. Rather an excerpt.\n""All that you touch and all that you see\nAll that you taste, all you feel\nAnd all that you love and all that you hate\nAll you distrust, all you save\nAnd all that you give and all that you deal\nAnd all that you buy, beg, borrow, or steal\nAnd all you create and all you destroy\nAnd all that you do and all that you say\nAnd all that you eat and everyone you meet (Everyone you meet)\nAnd all that you slight and everyone you fight\nAnd all that is now and all that is gone\nAnd all that\'s to come and everything under the sun is in tune\nBut the sun is eclipsed by the moon"" This song perfectly encapsulated the human race (in my opinion) and ends where the album started. A heartbeat, with a man saying for the final time...\n\n""There is no dark side in the moon really, matter of fact its all dark.""', '']",5.00 stars
IrritableSatirist,"['What is human experience in the modern world? A heartbeat exploding into life, the ever-looming threat of madness, the catchy consumerist dystopia, and the anthropological phenomena that have shaped our consciousness. Pink Floyd explores all these aspects, in the context of Syd Barret’s mental decline, in their 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nWhile not as emotionally compelling as later Pink Floyd works, the album certainly deserves a spot as one of their best works. Every sound blends together effortlessly, into a phenomenal technical achievement. It also transcends the progressive rock, reaching iconic stature through the groovy tunes of “Time” and “Money,” and exalted heights of “The Great Gig in the Sky” and “Brain Damage.”\n\nOne of the greatest rock albums ever made, no doubt.']",4.50 stars

If it wasn't regarded as one of the best albums of all time I would probably have given it a 2 star ranking as there are some good bits like on the run but other than that everything else is pretty gay. Wow, these rich rockstars are crying about getting older or dying. Money is the most insulting song on the whole album. Rodger Wateris and Gilmore are clearly armchair socialists with their drivel about how money is a crime. Yeah.. okay? Have either of these guys actually ever worked a day in their lives? I know Gilmore had it rough on the streets at one point but come on mate and don't even get me started about old horse face. Seriously the guy went to a nice school and then went to architecture school and he still has the audacity to pretend money is some great plight on society while raking in millions. Here's an idea rodger, if you love Palestine so much why don't you go and help build schools or something over there instead of whinging about Israel all the time and crying because you could only afford a Gulfstream G100 private jet instead of a G150.\n\nOther than shitty - oops I mean money the other songs are pretty boring. Although Rodger and Dave's harmony on Us and Them is pretty good. But yeah pretty shit album all around. If it weren't so damn insulting I wouldn't even bother reviewing it because it isn't worth a thought but okay. But if you value your time at all (no pun intended) give this one a hard skip.""]",0.50 stars

Ismalva065,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Although everyone considers it a pinnacle of progressive it seems to me that this album is closer to styles such as Art Rock, there are even several jazz moments and why not say it the truth is that the interventions of ""Dick Parry"" on the saxophone and the Incredible voice of “Clare Torry” in several of the songs were coupled in a fantastic way to achieve a very peculiar sound, unique and present only in this album. Although it is supposed to be a concept album, its songs can be heard separately without problems, except for the first two and the last two that I suggest always listening together: ""Speak to Me / Breathe"" which would represent birth and childhood and ""Brain Damage / Eclipse ""that would represent madness and death, the former with a resemblance to a jazz band and the latter a minimalist theme that contrasts brilliantly with the rest of the album. There are two instrumentals that some consider weak points but they are not at all: ""On the Run"" and ""Any Color You Like"" and they fulfill their function of giving fluidity very well. The other songs: ""Time"", ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", ""Money"" and ""Us and Them"" are simply genius and anyone can be considered the jewel in the album, personally I prefer Time and Money but I don\'t blame anyone without considering ""Us and Them"" or ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" as the great songs on the album. Many things are said about this album, that if it is overproduced or if it had a bad influence on the market and would discard punk as an answer ... etc, simple speculation, better why not listen to it from beginning to end, after all it is a masterpiece.']",5.00 stars

Splinteredsilhouette,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'I thought long and hard about if I should bother reviewing this album. It’s The Dark side of the Moon, anything that can ever been said about this has already been said, and I’d be surprised if I could add any insight that hasn’t been said better before. But then what else will I do to waste away the hours that make up the dull day? Apologies… I am sure this review will be full of awful bits like that. So anyway, The Dark Side of the Moon – The greatest record ever recorded and it’s not even Pink Floyds greatest record.\n\nSo why is it considered the GOAT? Or at least one of at any rate. Well, it just has such universal appeal. The album is just about life, or at least it is to me. Opening with the double whammy of Speak to Me and Breath (In the Air), the mood of album is set early. The beautiful melodies and laid back sound, and the lyrics that speak to nearly every single person on a deeply personal level.\n\n“For long you live and high you fly,\nAnd smiles you’ll give and tears you’ll cry,\nAll you touch and all you see,\nIs all your life will ever be”\n\nWhat an incredibly beautiful and succinct description of life. The ups and the downs, everyone you know and love, that is your life. And yet, it’s not all like this…\n\n“For long you live and high you fly,\nBut only if you ride the tide,\nAnd balanced on the biggest wave,\nYou race toward an early grave”\n\nAgain, beautiful, poetic and it speaks to me, to everyone, on a deeply personal level. It moves me. And what more is there to get from music? Art should move us, or else what is the point? Roger Waters is truly one of the most incredible lyricists I have ever had the pleasure and honour to experience. The album then takes a turn for the experimental. On the Run is one of those songs that was made on a synthesiser, which was basically brand new at the time. It was a new sound, and though I do think it somewhat dates the track to the time it was made, it has such a manic feeling to it that the album just wouldn’t be the same without it. Life is manic. The song fades into what many people, my self-included, consider Pink Floyd’s masterpiece – Time. A song with such universal themes, so delicately and beautifully put that it is difficult to think anyone could find no pleasure in listening to it. David Gilmour opens the song\n\n“Wasting away the hours that make up the dull day…”\n\nAnd it is just one of the most stunning, life affirming songs I have ever heard.\n\n“Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain,\nYou are young and life is long and there is time to kill today,\nAnd then one day you find ten years have got behind you,\nNo one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun”\n\nGod that hurts. Have ever truer lyrics been written? I remember being 16, going to the air show with my girlfriend at the time and lying on the grass, my whole life ahead of me. I’d just left school, I had a 12 week break before college started, I was in love and life was good. Next thing I knew, I was a 26 year old drug addict with no career, no prospects, nothing. In the blink of an eye I was stranded in my own life. No one told me life was passing me by, or if they did I wasn’t listening. Ten years goes in the blink of an eye, as anyone older than 20 will tell you. Listening to Time, those lyrics hit like an emotional hammer to face. They leave me reeling, cast adrift in momentary despair until David Gilmour arrives with the most heavenly guitar solo you are ever likely to hear. Calling it a guitar solo doesn’t really do it justice to be honest. It’s a sound that lifts you from the pit of despair you have just fell into, soft as a cloud and it lets you know that it’s going to be OK. You can still make something of yourself. Another blink of the eye later, now aged 36 I am married with a beautiful daughter and the greatest wife imaginable. She lifted me from what I had become and moulded me into what I am. I often think of her when listening to that guitar solo.\n\nTime is something that we all have a limited amount of and the song its self fades into The Great Gig in the Sky, a song about Death. But it is just another part of life, one we all must experience, and the song is simply beautiful. It is famous for the vocals of Clare Torry, and they are absolutely stunning, but it’s the piano of Richard Wright that ultimately makes the song what it is. Just a stunning piece of music. It concludes the first side The Dark Side of the Moon in just the most amazing way. This isn’t just an album of songs, this is an album of themes and the first side simply encapsulates so many feelings of life. Life is beautiful and ugly and happy and sad. We think we have all the time in the world, but the world is manic and it passes by in a flash. We all die in the end, but it need not be something we fear. Surely these themes are nigh on universal? Utterly timeless, as relevant in 2020 as they were in 1973. No one on this planet will ever convince me that someone will not listen to this record in 3073 and not be moved by it, so universal are the themes, so well presented and simply jaw dropping to listen to.\n\nThe second side of the record opens with one of the bands most famous songs Money. Even if you have somehow never heard Pink Floyd in your life, you have heard this bassline. There is no way on Earth you haven’t. That looping classic bassline is so engrained in the history of Rock music. The song is what I consider the weakest track on the album, but it’s still an utterly perfect classic. The themes on the second side of the record are a little more specific than those on the first side. The opener dealing with Money and our endless pursuit for it. I feel Dogs from Animals is almost a sequel to this song, at least in terms of themes.\n\nUs and Them is a song about War. Roger Waters’ father was killed in World War 2 when Roger was just a boy, and this affected him to a huge degree. He may be one of the greatest song writers of all time, incredibly rich and a key member of one of the most famous bands to ever exist, but that doesn’t make him happy. The song details the unfairness of War, the pointlessness of it all and how it is part of human nature.\n\n“Forward he cried from the rear,\nAnd the front rank died,\nAnd the general sat,\nAnd the lines on the map,\nMoved from side to side”\n\nMany bands have delivered this message, and Pink Floyd certainly weren’t the first but I would always rank Us and Them as one of the greatest anti-war songs ever written. Again, it just moves me. The swell as the afore mentioned lyrics are sung is simply incredible. The song fades into Any Colour You Like, a pretty funky and upbeat instrumental before the album before the album lurches into a song about mental illness – Brain Damage, the song from which the album takes its name. Is it a tribute to Syd Barrett? Is it just a poem about how life makes us all a little mad? How it changes us to its course rather than vice versa? The song eventually fades into Eclipse, which I believe is bringing back the themes of the first side of the record, except this time, Roger Waters is singing, and that cynical sounding voice of his completely changes the feeling of it. I think the closing song is open to interpretation.\n\n“All that you touch\nAnd all that you see\nAnd all that you taste\nAnd you feel\nAnd all that you love\nAnd all that you hate…”\n\nThe song is essentially a list, and it recalls the beginning of the album\n\n“And all you touch and all you see\nIs all your life will ever be”\n\nEclipse expands on this but instead of saying “This is your life” it ends with Roger Waters saying\n\n“And everything under the sun is in tune\nBut the sun is eclipsed by the moon”\n\nNow, I love Pink Floyd and how utterly life affirming this album is, but the cynicism at the end is what elevates from jaw dropping to simply Godlike for me. To me this means that indeed, “all you touch” is “all your life will ever be”, but bringing back the lyrics from Brain Damage about the moon, and its symbolism with lunacy (The world its self is obviously derived from Lunar) to me just means that life its self is everything, but it will drive you mad. Is this referring to dementia? Is it referring to life just slowly breaking our minds? I don’t know. I would google it, but what’s the point? This album means too much to me for it to be spoiled by someone else’s opinions on the lyrics.\n\nI didn’t set out to write a Track by Track of this record, but I felt it was the only way my limited writing skills could begin to convey the depth of emotion contained within this. I mean, like I have said, its The Dark Side of the Moon. What else can be said about it?']",5.00 stars

KindOfBleu,"['Far from the greatest album of all time, but The Dark Side of the Moon holds up as one of the greatest rock albums in its long, diverse history, and clearly, one of the best prog albums. I think it\'s easy to deride this as boring or boomer-esque, but I think it holds up better than most albums released around the same time. Sometimes its production is a bit too smooth for its own good, but when it hits, it hits. Everything about ""Time"" is the best example; sure, it\'s long, but it\'s a damn passionate and hollowing song, and its production brings out that dreadful atmosphere and pain. ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" also works out much better, because I\'m pretty sure it would be a snoozefest had the band chosen a worse engineering team.\n\nLyrics? I try to not care much for them. Lyrics in prog rock? Yeah why should I care again? This album does little for me lyrically; although it\'s certainly well-written, despite its occasionally-dull poetry, the atmosphere and the music is much more interesting. And I\'m fine with that, because this doesn\'t speak to me like it did when I was younger and needed a more depressing and solitary album. And ""Money""? Objectively overplayed on the radio, but that second half still kicks ass as far as jazz-rock-meets-prog goes.\n\nOh, and the final ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"" sequence has always stood out to me for some reason. I guess they figured they needed one final moment of intensity to close the album and fully finish its concept. Whatever its purpose, it\'s quite nice. Great album, probably not their best, and it gives me an incentive to revisit their discography again.']",4.00 stars

Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, etc. All of these records have this sort of bullet-proof recognition for one reason or another. Even then, many of us music snobs could probably find a reason or two why someone might think these albums are overrated. Not to say any of these records are overrated, just saying that one could potentially see why someone might find these albums to be overrated; which leads us to this album.\n\nIt is typically the general consensus that 1973\'s The Dark Side of the Moon is Pink Floyd\'s greatest musical statement, and besides the fact that I always go back and forth between this and 1977\'s Animals, I couldn\'t agree more. I do not see myself getting behind any argument for this album being overrated. To me, this is one of those few “classic” records that TRULY deserve every bit of success they’ve had. This record is a complete and expansive sonic odyssey through the universe.\n\nAn almost completely spoken-word intro, ""Speak to Me"", kicks the album off, and contains interviews from Pink Floyd of random people off the street. These spoken-word samples pop up throughout the record, answering if they are afraid of death, if the last person they punched deserved it, the worst thing they had ever done, etc. This track is an incredible stage-setter and build-up for the rest of this experience. Each track on the first side soars in its atmosphere, from the guitar layers and David Gilmour\'s meditative performance on ""Breathe (In the Air)"" to the subtly tense and paranoid keyboard passage-work that reminds me of a panic on an intergalactic space station in ""On the Run."" ""Time"" is obviously a standout track on this record; the first almost 2 and a half minutes of music on this track sets the stage for the rest of the song with Richard Wright\'s keyboard providing such trance-inducing tension, which leads to this Gilmour-driven anthem of epic proportions. Can I also say, the word ""epic"" is perfect when describing David Gilmour\'s guitar solo wedged in between the two halves of the track. This solo provides the track with so much more body than it already had. Undeniably essential 70\'s rock track. After a short reprise of the ""Breathe"" refrain, just when you thought it couldn\'t get any better, the first side of this record ends with the track ""The Great Gig in the Sky."" After a beautiful piano introduction from Richard Wright, accompanied by a spoken word sample of a man who lacks fear of death, the track absolutely explodes into an unbelievably powerful and passionate wordless vocal performance from guest singer Clare Torry. I think it\'s safe to say that there is nothing quite like this; even at her most frantic moments that should sound ridiculous, it is one of the most euphoric moments on the album. The track eventually dies down into this softer restatement of the original improvised themes, and one could even argue that this softer section is even more euphoric in its intimacy and its held-back energy. She sounds ready to explode into her frantic vocal soaring, but it\'s like something in her is holding back. The album could\'ve ended this way and it still would have probably been one of the more celebrated records in the progressive rock world. But side 2 ends up being just as essential.\n\nSide 2 opens with Roger Waters\' iconic bass-driven groove titled ""Money."" I will admit, this track takes me out of the experience a little bit. If there was any track that separated itself from the spacious atmosphere of the rest of this album, it would be this track. Complete with a verse, chorus, verse, chorus, instrumental break, verse, chorus, outro formula; this track is definitely the most straightforward on the album. But of course, Pink Floyd works to counter that by making this memorable-ass bass groove in 7/4, providing a frantic and wild saxophone solo (played by English session saxophonist Dick Perry), and not to mention the continuation of memorable guitar solos from David Gilmour on this track as well. This track transitions seamlessly into what is arguably my favorite song on this album, ""Us and Them."" Note: to me, the rest of this album from here on could have been one track. It feels like one track to me. But I digress. After a Richard Wright chorale-like organ intro, the rest of the band lay down the absolutely beautiful chord progression that will permeate through much of the track. Dick Perry jumps into scene again with a much more subdued and serene saxophone solo this time, sometimes even blending into the sound of the rest of the band. This leads to Gilmour\'s most intimate vocal performance on this album; a beautiful verse whose chord progression slowly builds into the most explosively gratifying chorus in any Pink Floyd track. Multi-layered vocal harmonies and a colorful explosion of sound from the band that is capable of the highest of ear-gasms. The best part, this explosive chorus happens not once, not twice, but three times! Plus an instrumental version in the middle of the track! SO satisfying. The track transitions seamlessly again into the instrumental ""Any Colour You Like"", which begins with a series of grandiose and echoed Richard Wright keyboard passages. Following this is a choppy and enveloping guitar solo from Gilmour. This track leads to ""Brain Damage"", a somber look into the mental breakdown of an artist (an idea that Pink Floyd explores more than once) and a reflection on former band member Syd Barrett, who suffered from schizophrenia. To me this is truly the final track of the album, as the chorus sounds like the final words of this journey. Maybe that\'s honestly because it says the album title... it\'s entirely possible; but that doesn\'t stop the music from feeling so much like a resolution, even if it\'s lyrically quite the opposite. The final track, ""Eclipse"", musically feels like an epilogue. The explosive quality of the band and layered vocals are absolutely electric. A perfect way to end a near perfect experience. Of course, you can\'t forget the final words of this album: ""There is no dark side of the moon. It\'s all dark, really."" I am at a loss with that final quote, but I am not even going to try to take a stab at what that\'s saying.\n\nSo, yeah. The Dark Side of the Moon mostly is as good as everyone says it is. This multi-faceted sonic adventure really creates an environment and story that is unique to this album. An environment that no band could recreate, let alone create it nearly as powerfully as Pink Floyd. Not only is this album an incredible way to introduce Pink Floyd, but also progressive rock in general. I think many people will agree Pink Floyd are an incredibly consistent band, especially throughout the 70\'s; and people can argue which golden-era Pink Floyd album is the best all day long because they\'re all so neck and neck. But I do think this one has always held such a special place in my heart, simply because of how immediate and singular the whole experience really is.\n\n9/10', '']",4.50 stars

Rapthoughtworld,"['This album is so fucking over-hated. Yes, it is popular. No, it isn\'t the best album of all time like all your uncles tell you. But it\'s still a damn good album. It\'s incredibly cohesive, it has a strong narrative, Gilmour\'s guitar is stunningly gorgeous, the overall instrumentation and vocal performance is vibrant and colorful, and it gains in its brevity. Dark Side is easily the most consistent Floyd record and it shows. Although it may not be ""real prog"" like many of its critics suggest, that doesn\'t really matter, because it\'s one of the best rock albums anyways. Dark Side carries lush instrumentals that cascade around its themes in a very compelling way as it weaves a narrative warning about the pitfalls of life that can lead you off course and drive you mad. The unending march of the clock stops for nobody but if you sit around sad about life\'s end you\'ll waste it (Time). Us and Them beautifully tackles the divided nature of humanity; constantly fighting on two sides instead of looking for unity. Money is pretty obvious in its theme. And it all leads up to the opulent Brain Damage-Eclipse which do a sensational job of driving home the themes of the album, making it feel important and like the strong life statement that it is, and giving a sense of completeness only the best albums have.']",4.00 stars
FreakingJames,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(English isn\'t my main language, sorry if I made a few mistakes)\n\nThere\'s something to be said about an album where people are mostly mocked for not liking it even when the criticism is well though out and meticulously crafted, it seems as people choose to just notoriously agree to call Dark Side of The Moon as ""the best album of all time"" just for the sake of common sense and not because of actual musical reflections and analysis. I\'m not saying there\'s not people who genuinely like this record, I\'m saying that this album has gained a pretty trash and savage following over the years, I guess you could apply what I\'m saying to albums like Ok Computer and MBDTF as well (especially MBDTF) But none of them come even close to the DSOTM following.\n\nThis thing is so far from the best thing in the world. On The Dark Side Of The Moon, Pink Floyd has managed to nail some things they\'ve been missing since The Piper: consistency, and that\'s something I can give lots of credit. Another thing being especially the production engineering which by this point is the most undeniably good aspect of this record, something so luxious and timeless, They\'ve also come off with some of their most whimsical lyricism and a pretty underrated aspect of this record is the use of sound collage, people don\'t think about these passages as actual part of the music, rather they think it\'s merely a intro for the actual music, let me tell you, if the whole album developed these collages to make much more presence in the compositions then I could see the hype surrounding this thing.\n\nDark Side compared to previous works, is focused on the tamest, sparse, most predictable and linear collection of songs they\'ve had (just slightly less than their short folk songs on Meddle), if anything, this album is anti-charismatic performances, This is probably the album that made it common to call Nick Mason a ""useless drummer"" since percussion-wise this is the least present he has ever been, the cosmic keyboard of Richard Wright were limited to atmospheric accompaniment, Vocals were reduced to weak dreamy performances with melodies that do not stand out, the only examples of vocals going in different directions are obviously ""Money"", ""Time"" and ""Great Gig In The Sky"". unfortunely though, the vocal diversity of these two tracks do not compensate for the fact that they work the same way every other track does instrumentally, the entire album even as refined as it is, is structured on repeating the same refrain and the same tempo and the same chord progressions and even same key. None of these characteristics are related to the overall concept so there\'s really no excuse here\n\nTalking about the concept, as much as I don\'t mind it, I can\'t say it doesn\'t come off pretentious, I think it\'s pretty stretching it saying I\'m supposed to feel that The Great Gig In The Sky is about ""death"" when nothing about the track offers a sound that does make me think of that topic, I mean, it is one of the better tracks on the album but it\'s the most oddly placed when it comes to concept. That\'s the main issue I have with the direction this band took; We\'re all supposed to follow a history we can\'t exactly relate to it in visceral degrees. All the sonic decisions and compositions do not emphatize emotion, the meaning and feeling of each and every song is not naturally obtain, the band simply demands that you have to feel certain thing because the concept demands you to do so just to ""get"" something out of it. At the 60s Syd Barrett wrote songs that were both introspective but easier to reach an emotional impact, it didn\'t have to rely on concepts and history tellings; Dark Side Of The Moon is almost an Arrogant manifesto at this point, because if you simply don\'t feel like the tracks reach you the way the band wants you to feel, then it\'s your fault for not ""getting it""\n\nWhat are the moments that this album shines the most other than Great Gig? Let\'s start with ""On The Run"" which It\'s just fantastic how different it is and how it pratically gets the point across to why this album is so basically crafted. Everything I said about the performances is specifically subverted here, the electronic minimalistic synthesizer sound is looped through out the whole thing while the collages make a spectacular contrast. With the sounds of a helicopter, running steps, heavy breathing, subtle fast paced hi hats. by only listing the sounds, can you see how this already gives you a hint about the actual commentary of the track? you don\'t need lyrics for your ramblings. sometimes the ""sound"" is better than the indulgence of directionless liricism\n\nThe Whole intro section of ""Time"" (0:00-2:17) is also really great, this one fix my complaints with the percussions, since this one presents polyphonic rhythms, Martial bass lines, bery organic and clean sounds of Clocks that contrasts the whole atmosphere for something more menancing in a way, this whole section is the future and the past coming together, a tribalistic ritual with futuristic effects. too bad that right after this whole section instead of developing much futher the album comes back to it\'s main cliche structure of basic percussion. It\'s one of the better tracks including that cliche though seems it does throw out the most changes, vocals here are great and catchy. it\'s one of the few times where this formula truly fews inspired\n\n""Any Colour You Like"" is another track were it\'s intro is more amazing than the entire thing. Probably one of their most beautiful uses of the electronic sound, but the rest falls under the redundant funky riff they\'ve used and reused previously.\n\nThe Rest of the album falls under the samey category except for ""Money"", but Money is a special problem, since it doesn\'t fit into the album sonically, and it\'s probably the second most uninteresting track since it just basically falls under a basic uneventful rock song with a unremarkable guitar riff\n\nThe Explosive chorus of harmonical choirs on the backround of the main vocal lines as much as they can sound cheesy (and they do a lot on this record) they are not bad, but the fact the entire album is filled with that makes them way less special. Not to mention that The band has certainly perfected that in a much more satisfying way on the feel good cuts of, A Saucerful Of Secrets\n\nAt the end of the day I could simply call this album a pretty inofensive effort and call it a day, but for some reason this album still carries on with this stupid ""uncriticizable"" pedestal. It\'s far from the band\'s most ambitious record, it\'s far from the most overwhelming, it\'s far from the most interesting, damn it\'s not even their most pretentious work even, this album truly only hits as a middle of the road one for me.']",2.00 stars
JoePickles,"[""How Pink Floyd went from Obscured By Clouds to this in a year is a mystery to me. This album is fairly unanimously praised because it’s so awe-inspiring yet so accessible. Pretty much anyone can appreciate this album on some level. There’s wistful lyrics, powerful instrumentation and catchy melodies to top it off. Each track pursues a different sound, keeping the album fresh. The only issue is the sense of grandeure can occasionally become a little cheesy, but that's not really the point of the record- it's about the experience of the sound, not the message behind it.""]",4.50 stars

BloodPump,"['So, for the past week I\'ve focused on reviewing the three best (or most acclaimed) records from the biggest prog acts of the 70s. Yes, Genesis, and King Crimson. Inarguably three of the most essential bands in the genre of progressive rock. Their best records all came in the first half of the 70s, leaving room for fresher acts like Rush or Mike Oldfield to expand on, while many of their over the barrier peers like Can had a set of classics worth calling masterpieces as well. So, where was Floyd in all this before DSOTM? They were no slouches themselves but the real standout among everything would be the slightly under the carpet Meddle, a generally quiet but excellent album.\n\nFor me, Floyd\'s \'big three\' came later then the other three bands of significance, as well as Cans. Their last in a stream of absolute must owns being Future Days in 73, Floyd\'s dark side would be released on the same year, wywh on 75 and Animals on 77. Much later dates then much of their peers essentials, but essentially no less significant.\n\nAm I over thinking numbers and dates for what is pretty much all about opinions and music? Sure am. It\'s just a curious pattern I noticed. Thought it be fun to talk about, and so too would be to use as a basis to focus on the three ""best"" from the big four of prog (while still relistening to their other stuff on the side). I shall not re review WYWH because I\'ve said all I\'ve meant to on it before and it 100% stands. I won\'t talk too heavily on Dark Side either. We all know the music this record holds, we\'ve heard em all at one point and either love em or hate em. All I\'ve really got to offer is us and them is a perfect ballad and still just as gorgeous to listen too after the 1000th or so time. The record is legendary for a good reason.\n\nStandout tracks: Breathe; Time; The Great Gig in the Sky; Money; Us and Them; Brain Damage/Eclipse']",4.50 stars
JoshuaT0back,"[""For a long time, I fell into the consensus that Dark Side of the Moon was overrated, that it wasn't as good as the world makes it out to be. But after listening to it back and forth a few times, I am very happy to say that those contrarians couldn't be more wrong.\n\nThis album is timeless for a few reasons. I think the main star is not Gilmour, though his solo on Time remains as one of the greatest in Rock history, but rather Nick Mason. Mason's drumming on Money, The Great Gig in the Sky, and Any Colour You Like makes this album FULL. Especially how Mason and Clare Torry's vocals just EXPLODE together into a psychedelic explosion.\n\nThe second reason is David Gilmour, in contrast to a previous statement. Gilmour is IMMACULATE. Time, Money, Us and Them, and my personal favorite song Any Colour You Like, feature perfect guitar tracks and solos. The tones he uses are iconic for a reason.\n\nLet's talk about Us and Them / Any Colour You Like for a bit. Personal bias here. I remember seeing The Third Impact from The End of Evangelion mashed up with Any Colour You Like a while ago, and it's been stuck in my head ever since. That kind of visual with this song will make ANYONE trip.\n\n\nSeriously though, this album is the best in Pink Floyd's discography in my eyes because they feel grandiose without being too complex or weighed down by lackadaisical pauses to lengthen track time. It's 42 minutes long and does not waste a SECOND (if you don't think On The Run is a bit of a weird interlude). While some will say Animals is better, and I won't fault them for saying so since that album is indeed great, Dark Side has a distinct and unique sound that has been easily imitated, but never truly replicated. It's odd to have to go at bat for such a popular album (or THE MOST POPULAR album if you really think about it) but I felt compelled to vent a little.\n\nHonestly, praising this album is like saying good things about The Godfather. It's not new, it's not bold, it's just a popular opinion to like it or not like it. But I think every music fan should at least listen to this once to kind of understand why Rock music dominated the world for so many years.\n\nAlso it goes really well with Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 and I think that's super hilarious. youtube.com/watch?v=y7wyfTsIm1k\n\nBest Tracks: Time, Great Gig in the Sky, Us and Them / Any Colour You Like\n\nWorst Track: N/A\n\nOverall: 10/10.""]",5.00 stars

crawdaddy97,"['I\'m not exactly proud of my taste in music during my high school years. Bands like A Day to Remember, Asking Alexandria, Bring Me The Horizon, and other angsty ""tween"" bands flooded my iPod touch. I first became acquainted with the album art through my older, pot-smoking peers. I mean, c\'mon, there really is no avoiding the famous prism design in all its simplicity. I decided to give it a shot, and I haven\'t gone back since.\n\nMy ears were so flooded by a diverse range of novelty sounds and timbres to the point I had to actually check to make sure this album was over 40 years old. My adolescent mind was so blown that I decided to use this album as the basis for a high school ""passion project"" in which I went into detail about every track and its lyrics, sonorities, and personal impact on me.\n\nOne of my fondest memories with this album was the first time I heard ""Us and Them."" I had just arrived at school, and had to transfer from one building to another to get to my class. It was around eight in the morning during the fall season. The air was a tad bit frigid and several clouds hung over the school. The chorus delivered David Gilmour\'s soaring vocals just as I stepped outside to witness the rising sunlight breaking through the clouds.\n\nThat was the moment I was convinced this album was something special. The beauty of something so simple I had seen a hundred times was amplified a thousand fold by the simple - yet effective - songwriting. Even though it may not be the most thematically complex album I\'ve ever heard, I understand why people (including myself) love it. There\'s something so uniting and universal in the lyrics and rock n\' roll arrangement.\n\nEven though I don\'t return to this album often, I have to thank Pink Floyd for kick-starting my lust for music. They have served as a gateway drug for other fantastic artists like Radiohead, Björk, King Crimson, Boards of Canada, etc. I truly don\'t think my love for music would be as strong as it is now had I not discovered this project at such an influential point in my life.']",5.00 stars
stinkytransistor,"['The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) by Pink Floyd is an excellent example of nostalgia that possesses a music video more than content. Roger Waters has an impeccable understanding of the feelings that the non-believers feel about religion:\n\nThere\'s something that you can do. You can attack this and this and this. You can challenge religious authority, but then again, you\'re challenging the very reason why they were born and bred. They\'re nurtured and supported by their mothers, they\'re nurtured by a respect and a sense of belonging, and that can never be taken away. It\'s taken away from us but it won\'t be taken away from them.\n\nWe agree. And as progressive rock is defined by a confrontational attitude toward religion, so Roger Waters.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon (1973) by Pink Floyd is the most clearly in the line of music that the ending of a rock song is rooted in a particular band, and that the ending itself has a specific social, political, or aesthetic content. The song only became a great success because it is ""outrageous"" and is a prime example of a time in history when a band became so successful that they convinced their fans that they had the solution to all of their social, political, and even musical problems, thereby making them a new fashion icon.\n\nThis song and the four following ones, and all of Floyd\'s subsequent songs from the Dark Side of the Moon, are by no means about politics, nor even about the ""unjust nature of the world.""\n\nP.S.\nThe Dark Side of the Moon (1973) by Pink Floyd is to be adapted for the big screen by another illustrious band: the Rolling Stones.\n\nSinger Mick Jagger will executive produce the play, which will be directed by Ang Lee, the director of Avatar, The Iceman Cometh and Brokeback Mountain.

Mickyt_,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '\'The Dark Side of the Moon\', an album that\'s often considered one of the best albums from Pink Floyd and an album that\'s often considered as one of the best albums ever made, tonnes of people love it and consider it so, tonnes of people don\'t care for it and think it\'s overrated and I can see why for both arguments, where do I sit with it though?\n\nThe first time I ever heard this album was during one of my lectures last January or February, the homie nostalgia got me to listen to it in preparation for a Pink Floyd Worst to Best for our podcast and after I listened to it I really liked it but I felt like it wasn\'t as amazing as so many claimed it to be, I still took away some songs from it and even after doing that episode I listened to those specific songs continuously. I played some songs from Dark Side in the car with my dad on my way home and he loved the shit out of it, so he decided to just buy me a Dark Side of the Moon vinyl for my birthday, when I got the record I spinned it a fair amount, so much so that after a few months of listening to it the album grew on me to the point where I gave it a perfect score, at this stage it\'s probably my most played album in Pink Floyd\'s discography.\n\nNow move along to September when I began my classic albums dive list, it took me a few months to get to 1973 and we begin that year of classics with this particular album, prior to my re-listen I pondered for days on the public\'s perception of this album, as you know Dark Side is massively acclaimed among fans and critics alike but there are also a fair amount of people who don\'t really give a shit about it and think that it\'s highly overrated, and to some extent I agree as this album is the poster child album for those ""born in the wrong generation"" kids but on the other hand I heavily disagree because I genuinely think this album is incredible from its production to its concept.\n\nSo after listening to it again I am dead set on saying that in my opinion, The Dark Side of the Moon is an incredible album, it\'s one of the biggest achievements in musical history and is an album that everyone should at least listen to once in their lifetime even if the outcome of that is with a positive or negative perception, do I think it\'s still a perfect album though? Honestly I don\'t, I have one main gripe with this album, I think that this albums habit of reusing some of the same chord progressions and using the excuse that it\'s a motif is lazy, like the songs Brain Damage and Eclipse are literally the same fucking song, just make them one track rather than splitting them up into two, it\'s pointless and the progression from Breathe returns in the final climax of Time as well, I don\'t know why it bothers me this much but it does, besides that I have nothing but positives for Dark Side.\n\nI think that for its time the sound quality and the grand production is quite impressive, it sounds like one of the most refined projects of its time and the mix is so incredibly crisp, I could only imagine what it was like for music listeners at the time to hear this piece, instrumentally I think that what Pink Floyd do on here is spectacular, despite my annoyance at the reuse of chord progressions and the final two tracks sounding the same, each song prior to those is incredibly distinct from one another, whether that be the grand and often frightening The Great Gig in the Sky, the slick and jammy Money with its incredible bass groove and guitar solos, Us and Them with its slow paced progressions, its explosive chorus and its sweet saxophone incorporations and On The Run is loud with its scuttling synth based passage. I think that in terms of its concept its not that adventurous or emotionally driven unlike some of Floyds other work but I find it to be one of their most compelling, as vague as it sounds this album is about life, its struggles, what we as humans face within life, and each person\'s inevitable end, each moment in the lyrics and some of the song structures are meticulously crafted in such a way that ties in with this concept. I also love how effortlessly this album flows into each track, it blends so tightly together into a phenomenal technical achievement that I will not get enough of honestly, the album even comes full circle with its ending being a heartbeat like the beginning of the record.\n\nTo end it off I will say that I still think that Dark Side is amazing, its an album that I get so much out of in both the music itself and concept, personally I don\'t think that it\'s perfect, it is a flawed album and it\'s easy to see why people wouldn\'t care for it. Do I think it\'s Pink Floyd\'s best album? No. Do I think it\'s one of their best? Yes, easily. Do I consider it a classic?

Well, you could say the same thing about a few other albums, but think about it for a little bit. A reflective journey through the human mind with several chill-inducing and transcendental moments and an incredibly pristine production, that at the same time manages to be accessible for a huge audience and with arguably the most recognizable cover art of all time. You can’t tell me The Beatles didn’t wish they wrote this.\n\nThe band treats deep philosophical themes in a very human and humble way. They don’t pretend to know any answer to those questions that have boggled the thoughts of human beings for centuries. Instead, they just present them as they are, and seem to be as concerned as the listener.\n\nOne could spend ages talking about the songs. The way the world seems to open up in the first seconds of Breathe, the insane guitar solos of Time or Money, the climax of the last two tracks… Personally my favourite song is Us and Them, a purely emotional track about the horrors of war that truly sounds unlike anything else.\n\nOn a side note, I love the way sound clips and interviews are used here. They really seem to come at the perfect time to complement the song, or add to the view about life present in the album.\n\nI would personally recommend Dark Side to anyone who wants to start to listen to albums as their fist step. The way the tracks are connected to create a full experience and the high quality of the music throughout the project, really gives you an idea of how great albums can be as an art/entertainment form.']",5.00 stars

Many elements from “Meddle” still present here like dreamy and atmospheric sound but they added more flavor to make this album even stronger than anything they had ever done before. This album also isn’t shy to show their psychedelic quality in it with songs like “Any Color You Like” and “Brain Damage” and experimentation to explore more texture with abstract sounds that feel very cohesive as a concept album.

JustAddMusic,"['Far from perfect, but still a great listen. I don’t care too much for ’On the Run’ (bands like Can did the same thing but better just two years earlier on side three of Tago Mago) and ‘Money’ I find pretty annoying even though the bass line is pretty catchy. Funnily enough my favourite moments on the records come from session musician Dick Parry’s wonderfully warm saxophone solos rather than the seemingly universally praised Gilmour’s guitar playing. It’s particularly wonderful on ‘Us and Them’ and it’s definitely the best aspect of the song, it being one of the weaker songwriting efforts on the album. ‘Time’ on the other hand, is easily along with ‘Shine On You Crazy Diamond‘ my favourite moment throughout Gilmour era Floyd. The combination of fantastic song writing and beautiful, profound lyrics, with fantastic production and meaningful guitar solos is fantastic. It’s the first song on the album that really lives up to the reputation this album holds. It’s also the one that encompasses the album’s concept and is by far the best example of the concept in the whole track listing. When we get to side two, the observations regarding this concept become a bit shallow and far weaker than the existential study in the lyrics on Time (money changes people, modern life makes you a bit mad). They’re fine, don’t get me wrong, just not as profound as people make them out to be and if they hadn’t been done better before, they certainly have been done better since. Speaking of songs about going mad, ‘Brain Damage’ is a fine song despite my previous criticism and a great attempt at writing a Syd Barrett-esque composition. It’s got that playful guitar riff with lyrics that are spiked with a dark undertone that dominate many Barrett tracks. Definitely a highlight.\n\nOverall the album has some incredible high points but with some moments that I really don’t care for. The concept works fantastically well in some places but falls a bit flat in others, particularly on ‘Money’. Props for the fantastic production from the band though. It really makes this album very compelling and is why it still sounds so fresh today and why it’s still an essential listen to people who are just getting in to rock music and veterans alike.']",3.50 stars

handsovereyes,"['Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon\n\nIt\'s crazy. I called myself a music buff, and avid listener of different genres, and I never heard this album before (or any Pink Floyd album.) I think my main worry was that I wouldn\'t enjoy this as much as I am not a huge fan of Radiohead, and that that essentially means any slower English Rock I wouldn\'t get into the groove of, being that they are essential poster boys to the genre.\n\nPink Floyd Dark Side Of The Moon is inspired by true events by the band, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd descibes this being based on their lifestyles and former band members. The album is to deal with capitalism, war, mental health, morality. This interested me as other great albums have dealt with similar themes, like Kendrick Lamar\'s To Pimp A Butterfly or Kanye West\'s MBDTF\n\nThe album starts off with spoken dialog with words which themes will be echoed throughout the rest of the project, while this Intro isn\'t the most catchiest, it sets off the album in motion which is all you can ask for an opening track:\n\nI\'ve been mad for fucking years\nAbsolutely years, been over the edge for yonks\nBeen working me buns off for bands\nI\'ve always been mad, I know I\'ve been mad\n\nSome might say this is a little on the nose but the fact it appears as conversation makes it seem more subtle than it looks on paper. This is Pink Floyd foreboding us like a Shakespearen play, this album will be about insanity, and capitalism. And so, with this knowledge prepped, let\'s jump into the second track of the album.\n\nThe track Breathe (In the Air) starts with screaming, which is heavily contrasted by a hypnotic guitar and quiet hitting drums, the atmosphere presented is not threatning or violent, instead calming and soft. This was my first big surprise of the album. With what I had heard I was expecting heavy distorted strings and loud vocals, instead the instrumentation takes a back seat in a lot of songs on this project, with the soft poetries of the 4 vocalists take us away to depressing imagery. In my opinion this works well in the context of this album, what is insanity truly? To be content in a world which is bleak? Our first true connection between working-life and madness is depicted in Verse 2:\n\nRun, rabbit, run\nDig that hole, forget the sun\nAnd when at last the work is done\nDon\'t sit down, it\'s time to dig another one\n\n\nThe imagery of this metaphor is creative, relating the repeating struggles of life to nature, is this what we were born to do?\n\nAnd all you touch and all you see\nIs all your life will ever be\n\nNext up is On The Run, which kicks off with a much faster pace as shit seems to get real. An arpeggio on synth concaphonates on the background on this one, as the sonic imagery is given foreground. No lyrics or vocals are on this one, simply samples of the outside world and syntheziers with drum hats looping. This is what I appreciate about this record, a lot of the meanings and introspection can be found simply in the music itself, which gives us a break from the more on-the-nose lyrics.\n\nTime is one hell of a depressing one, with the name of the track being the subject discussed. We are taking on time as a concept, and how it can run past us which I find heavily relatable. This is definitely one of the more notable tracks on the tracklist for me, mostly because this is the one I can say I relate the most heavily too. Especially as someone who has ADHD, I can underestimate how much time I spend wasting, and this only amplifies as I grow older. Again, with on-the-nose lyrics such as:\n\nTicking away the moments that make up the dull day\nFritter and waste the hours in an offhand way\n\nI always get the sense of imagery of looking up in a 9-5 desk job at the clock, thinking about how much time is being ticked past. As for the instrumentation on Time, it reminds me a lot of a western, with the different types of percussive hits. It would make sense that it draws inspiration from past events like The Western, which only clocks in the idea that this is one which has always existed. There\'s also a repeat of nature, with iconography such as the sun, or rain. As we get the impressions that we watch seasons and seasons fly past us.\n\nAnd in a very fitting fashion, the next track is The Great Gig in the Sky, a song about death. And much like On The Run the soothing piano and strings take away this one rather than vocals, in a way though, the fact this sounds smooth and relaxing says a lot about the Psyche of the band in a way which is disturbing, is this truly how they would describe death? Ironically, that\'s quite a bleak description given the subject matter. There are indeed vocals however on this track, with the Intro speaking:\n\nI am not frightened of dying\nAny time will do, I don\'t mind\nWhy should I be frightened of dying?\nThere\'s no reason for it, you\'ve gotta go sometime\n\nAgain, seems like Pink Floyd is sugessting that the idea of Death soothes them in a way. Creepy, but you can\'t help but be encaptured by the beautiful piano in this track, it\'s quite amazing. This is also in stark contrast to Time, where the idea of death seems scary, it really does review two sides of the same coin here.\n\nMoney is another stand-out track, with cash registers literally being sampled in the back. There isn\'t too much to pick apart in the background as it\'s not very subtle, but considering how subtle the rest of the album has been, it serves as a peek of the album.\n\nMoney, it\'s a crime\nShare it fairly, but don\'t take a slice of my pie\nMoney, so they say\nIs the root of all evil today\nBut if you ask for a rise, it\'s no surprise\nThat they\'re giving none away\n\nIt works well to convey the message even further. It really delves deep into what Money can do to an individual, with lines such as I\'m alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack implying that paper can turn one greedy and jealous. There\'s also a captivating sax solo which I can\'t help but repeat everytime I listen, absolute bliss.\n\nUs and Them is essentially a tear apart of the concept of War. This being the third concept track in the album after Time and Money. The first verse goes as such:\n\nUs (Us, us, us, us, us) and them (Them, them, them, them)\nAnd after all we\'re only ordinary men\nMe (Me, me, me, me, me) and you (You, you, you, you, you)\nGod only knows it\'s not what we would choose to do\n""Forward"" he cried from the rear\nAnd the front rank died\nAnd the general sat and the lines on the map\nMoved from side to side\n\nBrilliantly, as an individual fighting in a war, we would rather use communication and words to resolve conflict ""God only knows it\'s not what we would choose to do"", it now feels like this has been a choice decided for us, to die for something so needlessly pointless. This is probably the first time where the instrumentation has actually matched the lyrics on the track which makes it even harder hitting. The sax and the piano sounds minor and depressing, which ironically feels out of place so far. Also, another amazing sax solo in this one which never gets old.\n\nAnd, in the last verse as Pink Floyd has always done so far, they tie everything in a neat bow in the last verse, showing how war has an effect on individuals and the psyche.\n\nDown (Down, down, down, down) and out (Out, out, out, out)\nIt can\'t be helped but there\'s a lot of it about\nWith (With, with, with, with), without\nAnd who\'ll deny it\'s what the fighting\'s all about?\nOut of the way, it\'s a busy day\nI\'ve got things on my mind\nFor the want of the price of tea and a slice\nThe old man died\n\nWar has turned us cold, without caring for individuals. Such as a dying man on the streets, who needed money to survive. A chilling conclusion, but a fitting one nevertheless.\n\nAnd after such a cold and heart-breaking track, we get quite a beautiful sounding one. No vocals this time either, with beautiful sounding synthesizers which gives me the feeling of inspiration and control. This could be interpreted as Pink Floyd reminding us that we are in charge of ourselves and our actions, and we can change how we go about that. A reminder which is very reasurring after the horrible depictions on the previous track about how we can be changed by others decisions. The guitar on the second half of the track is also very infectious by the way.\n\n2nd to last track now and this is Brain Damage, sung by Roger Waters. This is a fitting conclusion to the end as all of the previous themes tie together into a study of one. Much like the new Joker, this song has a very similar message. Problems of society has damaged a man, turned him insane, mad, man. These are the consequences brought on by war, greed, money. But it also raises a seperate question, are you insane from straying from the path? Are you insane from straying away from how society tells us to be?\n\nThe lunatic is on the grass\nThe lunatic is on the grass\nRemembering games and daisy chains and laughs\nGot to keep the loonies on the path\n\nThe lunatic is in my head (Hahahahahahaha!)\nThe lunatic is in my head\nYou raise the blade\nYou make the change\nYou rearrange me till I\'m sane\nYou lock the door\nAnd throw away the key\nAnd there\'s someone in my head but it\'s not me\n\nLocking the door and throwing away key? Who are we to even decide this? I enjoy the spectrum of complexity they tackle the idea with. Nothing is black and white, and after presenting a very clear message, we are left to decide and ponder.\n\nThe album climaxes with its final song: Eclipse. As it hones even further down on the individual. The transition between the two songs are very smooth and it feels like a part 2 to the last track. I could analyse the lyrics but I feel like the very last words of the album describes this best:\n\nThere is no dark side in the moon really\nMatter of fact it\'s all dark\n\nIt\'s pessemistic but optimistic, much like the rest of the album. While trying to improve oneself is important to you, in the end none of it really matters. Dark, Ironic, Sad, but with a hint of inspiration.\n\nAnd though summazies the journey of The Dark Side Of The Moon. What are my thoughts? This album is fucking incredible and only got better after every listen. I am so happy to be giving another 10/10 to an album which so clearly deserves it. This album is so full of inspection, so intellectual, and so beautiful. Each part of the album has been carefully decided, with no element left without meaning. This is an album which still holds extreme amount of relevance today, which only cemenets its depressing concepts of Time being pointless. This album gets more and more meta and layered the more you dissect it, and one where more ideas reveal themselves after every play. An album which will now go on my personal Wall Of Fame.\n\nDark Side Of The Moon is a masterpiece, and if you\'re stupid like me and haven\'t given it a listen yet, rectify your mistakes immediatly.']",5.00 stars

yansa,"['When I first listened to this album, I immediately got why it had become such a beloved album over the years. It\'s dynamic first half does a great job of bringing you in with it\'s excellent tracks, from the wonky ""Money"", memorably played in 7/4 time signature, to the electric ""Great Gig In The Sky"" with vocals from Clare Torry. It\'s a powerful lineup of songs that can be listened to time and time again. I love the way the opening track transitions into the second one. I love the unique and philosophical lyrics about mortality and the value in life. This is an undeniably talented band delivering on undeniable talent.\nSo fine, good, great album right? Well, unfortunately, the way I see it, this album sorts of tapers off on the second half of the cut. By no means is any of it plain rubbish, but it\'s nothing revolutionary.\n""Us and Them"" goes on for far too long without developing much, even sauntering into ""Any Colour You Like"" which is in many ways even more forgettable.\nI give ""Brain Damage"" some credit, it\'s lyrics stand out for their compelling imagery, but the actual tune gets a bit old and sounds kind of airy and like it\'s lacking real emotion.\n""Eclipse"" is more of the same, and while it has a nice build up, it has similar problems to ""Brain Damage"" lacking that dynamic feeling of \'oomph\' carried along by the rest of the album.\nTo me, this is a great album trapped inside of a good album. It has some serious longevity and has made massive impact tremors on the music industry for years, but I\'ll just go ahead and say it:\nI think this album is overrated.']",3.50 stars
jpeggepg,"['I listened to this album last night with a couple friends. On the TV we had ambient images playing; fish swimming, a helicopter flying around, cars driving on the Golden Gate Bridge etc... And every single image seemed to relate to whatever song we were listening to. Every image, no matter how trivial, or random, was connected to the themes of the song. (it goes without saying we were super baked, but how else does one listen to Dark Side?) Cars stuck in traffic as Time plays; a school of fish swimming together during Us and Them; the Earth as viewed from outer space as Eclipse plays. But the images didn\'t just synch up; they seemed perfect, as if they were consciously and meticulously designed to emerge at a preordained point in the album. Every image reflected the profundity of the song. Everything is contained in everything. My friend called this the Floyd effect\n\nThis album is a high school staple, because it is the perfect venn diagram for coming of age; experimenting with drugs, finding yourself, really appreciating music for the first time, feeling meaningless, alone etc... It captures the anxieties of leaving the innocence of youth, and the coming realization that now, you have to live your life.\n\nHowever, among the pretentious and \'learned\' music geeks whom I associate, many of them grow out of this album, and it loses its ability to smack you in the face. Partly, this is just hipster backlash because the record\'s too popular; it\'s not cool to like Dark Side because everybody likes Dark Side. But some people actually just seem to grow out of the record. To them, it seems sophomoric, not as smart as it thinks it is, pretending to be deep but really saying nothing new etc... Like, when you first hear Money as a rebellious teen, it\'s the coolest, most radical shit; ""fuck money man, I want to live life!"" But then you grow up, are exposed to more subtle, more nuanced critiques, the realities of life, and you sort of laugh condescendingly at what you once thought of as \'profound\'.\n\nI refuse to ever succumb to this perspective. Firstly, your youth is worth clinging to. Did you listen to the album? Secondly, yeah, the album is cliche and obvious; war is bad, time runs out, people are greedy... But at a certain point, cliches are the only way to genuinely express a deep emotional truth. They\'re cliche because they\'re true. There is no way to genuinely express heartbreak without melodrama, because heartbreak is dramatic. You can hide behind cynicism and irony all you want, but at a deeper level, heartbreak does the same thing to every single fucking person on Earth; it makes us cry. So crying about heartbreak is cliche, but it\'s true. And worrying about the meaning of life, about time running out, about money dictating everything around you; those are cliche concerns, but they are cliche because we all have them, and to truly confront them is not to bask in irony or hide in nihilism, but admit they\'re affect and just give the fuck in.\n\nMoreover, people who write off this record when they grow up neglect the ample breathing space provided to the listener. Sure, the lyrics are focused and explicit, but they\'re also vague enough to leave room for you to interpret them in your way, according to who you are right now, who you\'ll be in 15 years, and who you were in high school. To dismiss Time as a dumb cliche exploration is to not actually explore what time means to you; the lyrics leave space for you to imagine , to think, and the instrumental solos communicate on a purely visceral level that demands some degree of true, unfiltered engagement with the record.\n\nThis album is both deeply alienating and undeniably sympathetic. For me, it oscillates between laughing at me, and truly feeling what I am feeling. I love that about it. It feels as cold as space and as warm as a beating heart at the same time.\n\nIt sounds reductionistic, cliche, and unsophisticated to say this album is about life. I know that sounds like something a high schooler getting stoned for the first time would say. But you can\'t deny it. This album is about life. A musical Moby Dick. In 45 minutes, it manages to touch on almost all of the most important, most fundamental concerns that a human being can have.\n\nTo bring it all back, the Floyd effect requires a degree of giving in to profundity, and finding meaning in anything. A bunch of fish swimming around can serve as a metaphor for anything you want. So give in, and fulfill your desire to find profundity in the mundane and the cliche.']",5.00 stars
mortalman,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '""There is no dark side in the moon really\nMatter of fact it\'s all dark""\n\nI am very aware that it is a near pointless endeavor to review this album since everything’s already been said about it by pretty much every music person on the face of the earth. But let me try. An album defined by dichotomy, duality and conflict: The Dark Side of the Moon was Pink Floyd\'s most extraordinary and vital work. Few albums at the time had addressed such vital themes: capitalism and greed; embracing the beauty of life; stop focusing on the stupid, unimportant things in life.\n\nBut what gives the album true power is the subtly textured music, which evolves from ponderous, neo-psychedelic art rock to jazz fusion and blues-rock before turning back to psychedelia. It\'s dense with detail, but leisurely paced, creating its own dark, haunting world. Pink Floyd may have better albums than Dark Side of the Moon, but no other record defines them quite as well as this one.\n\nEach original side of the album is a continuous piece of music. The first side begins with \'Speak to Me\', which forms a kind of overture previewing several sound snippets from the album. Drummer Nick Mason receives a rare solo writing credit because the only real instrumentation is his kick drum, treated to sound like a heartbeat. \'Breathe\' is a natural extension of the moody songs on previous albums with double-tracked vocals by David Gilmour. Slow and methodical, every note and beat counts while Gilmour adds rich in texture with overdubbed electric and pedal steel guitars. The lyrics are as simple and brief as the title and act as a short intro for the journey up ahead. After a short, one verse reprise of \'Breathe\', appended to \'Time\', comes the most unique and controversial song on the album. \'The Great Gig in the Sky\' has no legible lyrics, but instead contains about four minutes of improvised scat vocals by Clare Torry, a session singer who Parsons knew from other projects. Depending on your artistic point of view, this could be the worst or the best song on the album, the most meaningful or most absurd, and if nothing demonstrates why Pink Floyd is an acquired taste.\n\nSide two begins with \'Money\', a song which is a true double-edged sword, at once being one of the most recognizable and accessible Pink Floyd songs and one of the most overplayed and overrated. Still, for a hit song it is quite unique and artistically rewarding, written by Waters in the unusual 7/4 time signature for the verses before breaking into more standard, rock-oriented 4/4 time for Gilmour’s extended guitar solo in the middle. Parry and his sax have a more prominent role in \'Us and Them\', a song about as moody and surreal as one can get while maintaining top notch rock status. \'Us and Them\' directly bridges to \'Any Colour You Like\', another reprise of \'Breathe\' but from a totally instrumental approach. Musically, \'Brain Damage\' contains great layered guitars and a totally unique, synth-organ lead, while \'Eclipse\' reverts to a more traditional band jam led by Wright’s Hammond organ. Both songs also contain great female backing vocals. When the main instrumentation fades the sound of the heartbeat from \'Speak to Me\' comes back to the forefront.\n\nWho knows what music would sound like were it not for The Dark Side of the Moon. In the ‘70s it transformed the scene and marked Pink Floyd as one of the world’s most astonishing and bold acts. Just have a listen to modern music and you can still here the album resonating and striking. The band are still playing but have never reached the giddy heights of the early-mid-‘70s. The love The Dark Side of the Moon receives shows (the record) is not just a product of its time. The themes explored are relevant and vital today: as the world becomes more obscure and dangerous; the tales of isolation and embracing the good seem ever-pressing and vital.\n\nWhether you escape in the ambience or let your imagination surrender to the compositional brilliance: there is something for everyone within The Dark Side of the Moon. As much as I play the album, I can never get the bottom of the multi layers and ideas. It is a record that always reveals something new and suits a multitude of moods. Few albums promise that, and for that reason, Pink Floyd’s masterpiece remains one of music’s most timeless wonders.']",5.00 stars

Franconia,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'To many, The Dark Side of the Moon is a revelatory album. Call it entry-level, call it basic, call it bloated, call it outdated; some of these criticisms are correct, but for millions of people, it\'s a unique album that genuinely has the power to change people\'s lives and their perceptions of music. Back when this rapidly shot up to #1 in 1973, and today in a drastically different culture of music in 2019, this album is still powerful and massive. It\'s timeless for a variety of reasons, but largely because a. this sounds like a product of its times, combining the psychedelia of the late \'60s/early \'70s with the psuedo-philosophical bullshit of early \'70s prog rock, yet it still sounds like something polished and well-furnished enough to be modern, and b. because it covers topics that really haven\'t changed a lot since 1973, like depression, aimlessness, the problems of modern life, and the question of what life really is supposed to be about. These themes connect with everybody, it seems, from the 13-year old in the YouTube comment sections deriding modern pop to your grandfather as he\'s boasting of his record collection to that lonely, depressed college student who\'s just discovering music to your town\'s resident druggie who\'s gotten baked to this album more times than you\'ve gotten laid. Even those who deride this album have to admit of its classic status, and for a canonized classic rock album, this has survived quite well into the \'10s because, as mentioned before, it sounds like something more modern and futuristic, even though it has strong flourishes of its time. And for the third best-selling studio album of all time, this showed many people the wonders and pretenses of art rock; although it\'s designed as a fairly conventional pop album, it still has meaning and depth to it, unlike most albums with 30+ million sales.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is a great album that\'s difficult to talk about because it\'s been acclaimed to death, its status won\'t change anytime soon, and everything that can be talked about it has already been talked about before. While I\'ve had a bit of a reactionary phase against most classic rock and gone back and forth from giving this a perfect score to a decent one, I must admit that this album is still genuinely great. To me, it\'s one of those rare records where I have a deep and personal history with; I will touch upon that near the end of the review. Even though I like it a lot, certainly enough to be in my canon of favorite albums, I have a fair amount of reservations about it, most regarding the music, some regarding its hype. First, what\'s good about this album?\n\nA lot. Most importantly, The Dark Side of the Moon gets its points across. Here, I will quickly distinguish between a conceptual album and a thematic album, because this gets tossed around as a concept album way too much for me to not say anything about it. A concept album is an album that follows a general concept or plot; it doesn\'t need to be specific, down-to-the-wire and linear, but it\'s an album that often progresses and evolves with the story and stays within its concept\'s framework(s). Pink Floyd helped pioneer the concept album... it\'s just not here. It\'s later on in the \'70s. Hey, even one in the early \'80s! The Dark Side of the Moon is a thematic album, because it follows general themes that help guide the album and point its songs in directions, but not following a specific story or concept. While the transitions here are tremendous and its atmosphere doesn\'t undergo radical changes, where\'s the story or concept? It follows general themes of loneliness, worthlessness, pessimism, philosophy, greed, etc. It plays like a concept album, with fantastic transitions, good interludes, and sequencing that lets it run as a unified and cohesive album. But there\'s not a ton of evolution or progress here throughout, and its songs are guided by individual themes moreso than any story.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is an album set out to illustrate the modern world and reflect on its problems and the general lack of satisfaction, and yes, it\'s intended to provoke the audience. And that it does. Because not only are these songs well-written regarding lyrics (some see the lyricism here as pretentious prose, but it\'s actually really great; read the sheets for Time, the rhyme schemes and irony of Money, or the slow and gentle poetry of Us and Them), but the music is also quite rich. It\'s consistently atmospheric, and while its atmospheres slightly fluctuate (the moaning pains of The Great Gig in the Sky versus the playful jazz of Money), each song is still designed to express the issues of the modern world and reflect on them, whether it\'s by sulking or through sarcasm, and because these themes are still relevant today, it\'s no wonder why these lyrics are a bit more long-lasting than say, oh I don\'t know, All You Need Is Love. And I guess it works well as a thematic album, as each song handles a new concept or theme that falls under the umbrella of \'hey, society is fucked\'. On The Run is a fucking instrumental, unfairly criticized I must add, that expresses the feelings of being chased and rushed, invoking paranoia and feelings of powerlessness, only to flow right into Time, which captures the feeling of not having enough time and living an unfulfilling and pointless life. Us and Them, a title that\'s still relevant to today\'s divisions, covers war and how nothing seems to make sense, and its massive piano and organ during the choruses seems to highlight everything there is, and it\'s a wonderful and sparse track; it was originally designed as a part of a soundtrack, but was rejecting for being ""beautiful, but too sad..."". A fair description. Even the more instrumental and fluid tracks, like Any Colour You Like and the opener, still represent something, and the album\'s flow and running themes are too good to ignore.\n\nI already covered transitions, didn\'t I? What\'s similar to transitions? Oh right, the production. I don\'t think there was a better Pink Floyd album in terms of production, because it makes this album. With production any less polished or less dynamic, this would fall apart. Its sonic details are outstanding, and its fusion of progressive rock with jazz and psychedelia really works here. Some favorite moments of mine? The dazzling synths on Any Colour You Like. The ticking leading into a huge wall of noise only to revert back into haunting solitude in the intro of Time; seriously, it\'s a great song as it is, but are there many intros better than that? Us and Them\'s crescendo, where there are elements of free jazz and a filthy, moaning sax. The spoken word bits in Speak to Me and also Us and Them. These are some of my favorites, but my main point is that the production highlights small sonic details like these that makes for a very fulfilling and grand experience, for those who smoke and those who don\'t smoke. Nothing feels muddy or overcompressed, and everything is mixed very well here. When an instrument needs to feel dynamic, it feels dynamic as hell, adding to that massive feel.\n\nLastly, it\'s a cohesive album that also has standout individual tracks. Whether it\'s a massive prog album like Thick as a Brick or a stripped album like Pink Flag, there are always going to be albums that have a lot of density and run well as albums, but in terms of individual tracks, often aren\'t that strong. Disregard the above albums; one is one of my top 20 most beloved albums, the other is one of my favorite prog albums of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon both runs as a comprehensive and fulfilling album, but also has individual cuts that can work well on their own and are worthy of special acclaim. Time, Us and Them and Money are the big three. As said before, the intro to Time is unbelievably good, and the rest is also really great; the lyrics are wonderfully written and the song really evolves and progresses as all good prog rock should (most doesn\'t progress enough), and it\'s a rich and atmospheric song with a cutting-edge guitar solo. Us and Them is sparse for most of its run time, but worth it for the organ playing and the crescendo/climax. Money is a song I\'m sick of hearing on the radio stations, but I don\'t have anything bad to say about it. It has a bass line that every artist in 1973 envied Floyd for, and its use of an odd time signature works very well. It\'s bouncy and more upbeat than everything before it, and the sarcasm is fun and all. But the second half\'s jazz section is great, and I really mean great, because it\'s what bumps it up from a merely pretty good track to a perfect one.\n\nAnd for the reservations: I don\'t like this album a ton, although I have a lot to praise it for. Going off of the songs, there are a lot of songs here that are good, most great, that I really don\'t care for. Breathe and Brain Damage/Eclipse are really great tracks that I don\'t want to listen to if I\'m not listening to the album. It\'s not just because they\'re instrumental parts to the album\'s cohesion, it\'s just that I\'ve listened to them so many times before and they\'re not all that special. Even the three highlighted cuts are tracks I don\'t listen to all too much because I\'ve heard them and I don\'t have particularly pleasant memories with the album-something I\'ll highlight later on in this long, long review. There aren\'t any bad cuts here, and even the worst song (the opener) is still pretty good. And as the album\'s iconoclasts love pointing out, it\'s a tiring album that can be a bit boring. I don\'t listen to it much because there aren\'t many times where I really want to, and there aren\'t many where it really hits the spot. And while it\'s an excellent album, I admit that there are times where it just feels boring or just not my cup of tea. And even when I\'m in the mood, there are better albums I\'d prefer to listen to. If I listened to this everyday like I did when I was 14, I would eventually grow tired of it, which is why I only put this on every few months. And it hits the spot when I do. But I guess it\'s why I lashed out against Money a while ago (classic rock radio made me turn against a lot of canon songs, actually, but I still can\'t criticize Money). If I want a spacey nocturnal album, I can put on In a Silent Way. If I want an album critical of society that contrasts depressing music with more upbeat conventional stuff, there\'s OK Computer. If I want to curl up in a blanket drinking early grey tea at night to reflect on everything that\'s gone wrong with my life, I might pick this. Or I could play There Is A Light That Never Goes Out on repeat.\n\nPerhaps my biggest issue is that it\'s an unbelievably entry-level and basic album. I guess it\'s cool that the third best-selling studio album of all time falls under prog rock, and it definitely exposed the masses to a genre which wasn\'t too popular at the time, but it\'s simply inferior to many great albums in the prog rock sphere-both canonized and more obscure-and there were more ambitious and interesting albums that received far less acclaim and commercial harvesting. Even for 1973\'s standards, this undermines a ton of fantastic albums: my personal favorite of all time, For Your Pleasure, an amazing art rock album that combined glam with prog, Larks\' Tongues in Aspic, a more chaotic and ambitious progressive rock record that\'s unbelievably better, Selling England by the Pound, a career high for Genesis that\'s a greatly fun prog record, Future Days, an ambient-meets-Krautrock record which is more fun and easygoing, Innervisions, a psychedelic soul masterpiece which also works with jazz a lot, Paris 1919, an album which partially criticizes society but in a far more exciting and fresh sound, and a last example, Faust IV, which is another example of studio pioneering. Now, I prefer most of these albums, but even those that are inferior to The Dark Side of the Moon still are often overlooked in its shadow and their prospects of the \'best of the year\' accolade are cancelled. Sad, really. For progressive rock\'s standards, this is one of the best, but there are many better ones. Yes, King Crimson are a unique band in the prog sphere, but for good reasons: their improvisational and avant-garde style of prog is far more interesting and rewarding, and sometimes words are very unnecessary. The more playful, and sometimes technical, prog is generally better and far less dull than this, which drags at times. The jazz rock flourishes here I do quite like, and I wish more prog included, so it does have a one-up on most prog records because of that. But for its status as the biggest prog record, this is a bit pathetic because it was beat before its foundation and after its foundation. At least, in my opinion.\n\nTo transition into the final section of this unbearably long review, this album doesn\'t provoke particularly fond or sunny memories in me, and it has some brutal reminders that I don\'t want to think about when I listen to it. This will make more sense to those who read my reviews for The Wall and Wish You Were Here. Recapping seems silly because this album is where I began my personal connection to Pink Floyd\'s music.\n\nAnyways, The Dark Side of the Moon marks the period of when my depression really began to develop. Actually, it had already developed by the time I started really listening to this. I reckon, June 2014? But it was still developing and growing worse. I don\'t know how I discovered this album, but I did, and it didn\'t help anything. My social isolation and my bottling up of emotions (needless to say, therapy wasn\'t really helpful at this point) kept making everything worse, and I had few outlets besides running (which reinforced my low self-esteem because I sucked at running and my social anxiety got worse with a team) and this album. And I can understand why people call it a life-changing masterpiece, and that\'s partially true in my case. I listened to this all the time because it represented my philosophy: the modern world has issues, I felt isolated, depressed, lonely, and felt there was no direction or genuine purpose to life, and this album was just overwhelmingly fit for me. Basic and entry-level? Definitely. But there wasn\'t much else that made as big of an impact on me. It made me more depressed, convinced me to isolate myself even more, and as my depression grew more severe and sporadic as bipolar disorder erupted, this album was in even heavier rotation. This was before I became obsessed with The Wall, which was rock bottom for me in every fucking way possible, but I could feel every note of this album, between the emotional and soul-filled vocals on The Great Gig in the Sky to Waters\' scathing and bitterly pessimistic lyrics to Time, which I vibed with completely then. I can go into more depth, I won\'t though. While the album has a lot of passion and soul in it, it\'s not uplifting and didn\'t do anything to help my feelings that life was aimless and had no meaning. It marked the beginning of the end; I say end because fuck, my life did almost end. But this wasn\'t rock bottom. I don\'t mind telling my story with mental illness because it\'s important to break the stigma, and I had a more distant friend commit suicide in April 2018 whose death could have been prevented by breaking the stigma, and I don\'t want anybody going through mental illness by themselves like I did for a while. But spending a long time focusing on it and what could\'ve gone differently is still not something I feel comfortable about, and this album focuses on these memories for 43 minutes, which is too long for me. I can listen to it, but dwelling on these memories for that long without using it as background music is not something I ever want to do. It reminds me of one of the worst eras in my lifetime, and there\'s better depressing music that doesn\'t give me these memories. So, part of my reservations is that it amplifies past trauma and reminds me that I almost died, and the album likely made things worse. I\'m done writing about this for now.\n\nSo, it\'s a great album, but not the greatest of all time, not a masterpiece, and not an album I can listen to a lot and still remain interested. Its highs are pretty fulfilling, and it doesn\'t have any major low points, and it\'s a very cohesive album that hits the issues with modern life quite well. It\'s a testament to the shitshow that was \'70s Britain, but also connects quite well with most places in the West today; greed, aimlessness, confusion, paranoia, etc. I think that OK Computer did it better with more interesting music, but they\'re both fairly different records. My rating on this will likely fluctuate, but it\'s a great album that I can never dislike.']",4.00 stars

WinterBreeze,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""The Dark Side Of The Moon. The name alone could cause a shiver down anyone's spine, due to the legendary status it claimed over time. The band known as Pink Floyd had released something that grabbed everyone's ear and flung them off into the 6th dimension, where only existential despair exists. It's a work of art that nearly blinds everyone due to the sheer amount of power and creativity it has. It's album cover which is light reflecting from a rectangular prism, is one of the most iconic album covers in history. Might even be one of the most iconic pictures in general. It's so strange and unusual that it definitely deserves being talked about.\n\nSpeak To Me starts off with a steady heartbeat then quickly spirals off to impending madness complete with that terrifying laughing appearing near the end. It's almost like as if the album itself is laughing at you because it knows that you're not ready for what's about to come. Breathe then slowly crawls it's way up with a hazy atmosphere that can put someone in a trance. But that trance gets quickly snapped in half by the otherworldly On The Run, a personal favorite. I'd like to think that the visualization for this song would be the rainbow on the album cover having a seizure and throwing it's colors everywhere, with that demonic laughing popping up in the middle of it making things more unnerving. This probably blew people's minds to pieces back in 1973. After that one of the most iconic jump scares in history known as Time appears. Not the first time they scare someone with sudden noise. The clocks eventually trail off into this distant field full of 2 strings getting played back and fourth creating a tick-tock sound. All of a sudden the song fully kicks into gear as Waters shouts about ticking away moments that waste hours in an offhand way and other things. After the truly epic guitar solo that makes nearly all the other ones look at each other in shame, Time dies and The Great Gig In The Sky begins. It's one of the very few songs that gives me this uncomfortable feeling of dread. It's very much a bittersweet thing. And just like that, Side A is over.\n\nMoney, the song that Side B starts with. It's iconic cash register and clinking coins sounds demands your attention. It then goes off into this swagger-like direction for like the next... 4 or 5 minutes. I'm gonna have to be honest, this is the only setback for this album to me. It just keeps on wandering around everywhere and it just makes me bored. Eventually Money fades out and Us And Them settles in. Personally I think this is one of the best songs off the album. It reminds me a bit of The Court Of The Crimson King (which would make sense i guess) because of how it explodes whenever it feels like, it's always a spectacle watching it scatter everywhere. The album takes a brief break with Any Colour You Like which is a pretty song that does it's job well. The end then finally comes with Brain Damage which talks about lunatics leaving the asylum. It serves as more of the calm before the storm, which in this case the storm is Eclipse. It finishes the whole thing in a certainly grand fashion, then dies off with a very faint version of Ticket To Ride. Not much I can say after. There's a reason why this album still gets praised. Quite a bit of reasons.""]",4.50 stars
Music74,"['In the middle of reviewing the top 10 albums on rym. Pink Floyd first emerged out of the psychedelic rock scene with a lot of interesting and unique ideas. After the became known for a series of strange and very progressive for the time albums such as Meddle or Atom Heart Mother. All that experience built up to what I believe to be their magnum opus Dark Side Of The Moon.\n\nTracks:\n\nSpeak To Me: Starts the album off quiet and atmospherically. The knocking, ticking and other electronic sounds gets the listener excited for the album. The rambling and crazy laughter start off the albums theme of a human\'s descent into madness. Perhaps inspired by their former bandmate Syd.\n\nBreathe: This song sounds so relaxing and lush. The reverberating guitars sound great and build a nice atmosphere. Lyrics such as ""dig that hole, forget the sun and when at last the work is done don\'t sit down, it\'s time to dig another one"" are genius. My interpretation is that it talks about how most people are expected to not chase their dreams (the sun) and work an honest living their whole life even if they are not happy. It is a somber but true reflection on life as a whole presented beautifully.\n\nOn The Run: A very interesting track that experiments with eerie electronic noises and synths in ways that haven\'t been explored before. The rhythmic drumming is cool as well. The rumbling synths complete with the laughing, airport announcer voice, etc make this a slightly chilling but fitting instrumental track.\n\nTime: Potentially my favorite on the album. The chaos of all the different clocks chiming and ticking is a cool way to introduce the song. Then the guitars and drums come in and more traditional prog elements come in. Every lyric on here is genius and emotional. It is about not living your life to the fullest and realizing that you let time slip away. Lines like ""Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time"" are frightening but true. The mix of the background oohs and the lady wailing is a nice touch.\n\nThe Great Gig In The Sky: A more straightforward cut but the vocalist chosen to perform sounds beautiful here and the atmosphere is still pristine.\n\nMoney: Another highlight off the album. Lyrically the song is about greed and how people idolize material things. The cashier noises at the beginning before the guitars come in is cool. The singer (waters?) swaggery style of singing on this song radiates cool. The bassline is great on this too and the saxophone adds a lot of personality.\n\nUs And Them: What a serene and gorgeous song. It has themes of war and how the average person doesn\'t want to fight in wars but is being controlled by people who don\'t even have to get their hands dirty. This song comes at a perfect time in history following major wars every decade such as ww2, korea, vietnam. The blissful melancholic nature of the song makes it really soothing and calming. I like how the title compares us (normal citizens) and them (leaders).\n\nAny Colour You Like: The synths bouncing off each other create a beautiful effect and sound amazing. Then the guitar solo comes in and blows you away.\n\nBrain Damage: Song talks about a mental patient or whatever and I like how the title of the album is referenced in the song. When the song climaxes it is beautiful.\n\nEclipse: Great way to close the album in a huge fashion. The background singer sounds good and I like how the pounding that opened the album closes it too. Also, the closing line ""And everything under the sun is in tune\nBut the sun is eclipsed by the moon"" has too be one of the best lines ever.\n\nScore: High 9/10\n\n(Wil polish the ending of the review sometime in the next week need to go to sleep)']",4.50 stars

Every single song on this album is so iconic, it would be crazy if the average person hasn\'t heard at least one of them before, let alone know the classic album art. The album is a commentary on the struggles of everyday life, with each song being focused on a separate fear, struggle, or factor in modern day. Something not many notice is how the 2 sides of the album differ. Side A contains songs focused on the un-changeable or uncontrollable factors in our lives: Birth, growing up, and eventually death. Side B on the other hand is all about the more controllable parts of our lives: Money, politics, consumerism, and mental health. The album\'s final song ""Eclipse"" ends with Roger Waters singing ""All that you __"" over and over again, mentioning different things we have control over.

BVTheEpic,"['Generally considered to be Pink Floyd\'s masterpiece, The Dark Side Of The Moon is a landmark in rock music, and a notable strong point in their discography.\n\nThe album opens with ""Speak To Me,"" an overture that samples many of the sound effects and motifs found throughout the album, such as the cash register heard on ""Money."" There’s also a brief monologue talking about ""being mad for … years,"" setting the stage for the album\'s discussion of mental illness. I feel like I would enjoy the track more if it were mixed better- it\'s practically inaudible at times- but I still appreciate its presence here.\n\nThe first real song on Dark Side is ""Breathe (In The Air),"" begins by telling you to do what the title says and enjoy life around you, but the second verse changes things up by reminding you that no matter how much effort you put in and how much you accomplish, there will always be more work forced on you… and eventually you\'re going to burn out. The song starts off as a celebration and ends as a cautionary tale.\n\n""On The Run"" is a brief instrumental piece characterized by fast-paced drums (fitting, given the title). Footsteps can be heard as well… but who is running? And what are they running from? Death? It’s possible, given the subject matter of the next track.\n\n""Time,"" one of the album standouts, appropriately opens with a barrage of alarm clocks. The song ties back to the themes of ""Breathe (Into The Air),"" particularly that of your life passing you by:\n\n""And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it\'s sinking / Racing around to come up behind you again / The sun is the same in a relative way, but you\'re older / Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death""\n\nThe song is a reminder to live your life to the fullest, and to not waste it. It\'s a wonderful sentiment, and Pink Floyd expresses it through the combined vocals of David Gilmour, Roger Waters, and- surprise!- Richard Wright. That’s right, folks, this is one of those rare occasions where Wright performs the lead vocals, and his rendition of the chorus is stunning. ""The Great Gig In The Sky"" closes out Side A, and consists of guest singer Clare Torry vocalizing over an instrumental. An enjoyable enough track, and ""Time"" transitions into it perfectly.\n\nSide B opens with ""Money,"" which contains those cash register sound effects from the overture. This track is a critique of human greed, particularly that of the upper classes:\n\n""Money, get back / I\'m alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack / Money, it\'s a hit / Don\'t give me that do-goody-good bullshit""\n\nThis is just one verse, but similar lines can be found throughout the track; the intent is to display the avarice of the 1%, and their unwillingness to improve society and assist the less fortunate. ""Money"" also takes shots at Christians who claim that money is ""the root of all evil"" but then refuse to give to charity. It\'s a lyrically strong track, and it’s got a bitchin\' saxophone solo around the 2:00 mark.\n\n""Us And Them"" is an anti-war piece that proclaims how ""the other side"" isn\'t necessarily evil; they\'re just fighting to defend their country. They don\'t want to be there, and honestly neither do we:\n\n""God only knows it\'s not what we would choose to do""\n\nOne could conceivably tie this back to the theme of earlier tracks regarding living your life and not caring about senseless bullshit. And war? It\'s the most senseless thing there is, according to Pink Floyd. Wars are only fought to gain resources and satisfy human greed… which, coincidentally, is another theme on Dark Side! You gotta love concept albums.\n\n""Any Colour You Like"" is the album’s final instrumental track. I don\'t revisit it often- only when I\'m listening to it in the context of the full record- but it\'s got some tremendous synths and is arguably the best instrumental track on Dark Side.\n\n""Brain Damage"" is the first half of the one-two punch that closes out the album. As you might have guessed from the song\'s title, the track is about mental illness:\n\n""And if the dam breaks open many years too soon / And if there is no room upon the hill / And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too / I\'ll see you on the dark side of the moon""\n\nThis chorus- as well as the track as a whole- is intended to show sympathy for former bandmate Syd Barrett, whom you may remember leaving the band as they were recording their second studio album.\n\nAlbum closer ""Eclipse"" uses the sun and the moon as metaphors for mental illness, continuing from the previous track. Here, the sun represents all life has to offer, and the moon represents mental illness preventing you from enjoying life. ""[T]he sun is eclipsed by the moon…""\n\nThe Dark Side Of The Moon is a well-crafted, well-executed concept album that has rightfully earned its place as a hallmark of rock music.', '', 'https://bv-reviews.webs.co\nm/apps/blog/show/47172282-discography-ra\nnked-pink-floyd', 'https://bv-reviews.webs.co', 'm/apps/blog/show/47172282-discography-ra']",4.00 stars
escalation746,"['This album is uninteresting for progressive rock, tame for psychedelic, and too coherent for good space music. For perspective, realise that Tangerine Dream had already released four albums, using synths much more impressively. Hawkwind already had three albums in the can, and were by 1973 deep into a solid space groove. Popol Vuh, Faust, Can, and many other groups had released records full of experimentation and new sounds, even if this crew were yet to achieve any impact on anglophone listeners. On Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd aren\'t even experimenting within their own oeuvre, let alone by comparison to their contemporaries.\n\nSo, this album is not experimental; it\'s not innovative. Such descriptions only betray a lack of knowledge about the musical context of 1973. What then, is this record exactly? Why is it so massively popular?\n\nThis album is popular precisely because it lacks challenge but bears the signifiers of something challenging. The cover is perfect in this regard. It was designed using a corporate workflow, the band having no idea what they wanted and accepting what they were given. Of course they had no idea. There are no ideas here. The only suitable symbol for this album is something without context, shining down like some crazy diamond. I mean, like some Platonic ideal.\n\nBacking vocals simulate soul on ""Time"", ""Brain Damage"", and the over-the-top embarrassment that is ""The Great Gig in the Sky"". Sound effects on loan from the library litter the album. Generally these are used poorly, but do achieve coherence on ""Money"", where cash registers famously set up the rhythm. Here we get a proper ""song"", but the lyrics are so bad they sound like a parody.\n\nPink Floyd can\'t muster the least bit of excitement about anything, so ""rocking out"" is a big mistake. Turgid guitars and mainstream sax fail to express any energy. The general effect is like quicksand, sucking at the feet, bringing you down. Yeah, the album is a downer.\n\nNeither can the band create much of an atmosphere (unlike on earlier works). The sterile production denudes the music, placing it all into the same prototypical studio ""space"". Here there is no ""here"", no place to hold onto. There\'s something impressive about just how extreme this effect is. Impressive like those military displays, where armies march in precision, flanked by a row of tanks. This is production as fascism.\n\nMassive money in, massive popularity out. And because their listeners hadn\'t heard anything like it (no fault to them) it turned into the ""best album ever"". That very idea turns creativity into a circus. Pink Floyd were complicit with the machine that made them. Ever-happy to churn out the same soft grooves, designed to never rock the boat, they were able to integrate ""protest"" knowing that it was safe in its hermetically-designed sonic cocoon.\n\nThis finally changed with The Wall, when some sort of madness finally broke free.']",2.00 stars
Christroyer11,"['Pink Floyd was a legendary rock band from London, England whose impact on the music world knows no bounds. Formed in 1963 by Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters and Richard Wright, Pink Floyd had already come a long way since their formation. After gaining an audience in the underground, they signed with EMI and releasing their first major commercial album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, in 1967. Later that year, David Gilmour joined and in 1968, Barrett left the band due to worsening mental health issues. Waters became the lead singer and head songwriter of Pink Floyd, creating concepts such as The Dark Side of The Moon. The end result is a very ambient, abstract album that uses sound more than lyrics to convey its deepest meanings.\n\nThe opening track, Speak To Me, is a bit of a slow burner but it does a lot with the little time it has. It comprises of many little samples that give an overview of the the main themes of the album in chronological order. This song doesn’t hold its own as an individual song, but more as an intro, which is my main gripe with this song and this album. But since it is an intro, the flow from this song to the next is effortless.\n\nBreathe (In The Air) is what I believe to be the true track opener as Speak To Me should have just been part of this song in my opinion. This song comes in with these deliciously psychedelic and groovy instrumentation. I like the aesthetic of this song as it is hauntingly beautiful. The feel of this song is very laid back, but with very dark themes, much like the rest of the album. I like the deep, interesting lyrics on this song, even if they are preachy at times, making the message of enjoying life pretty clear.\n\nThe album seamlessly transitions to On The Run, which is a drastic change of pace from Breathe (In The Air). The urgent vibe on this song creates a frantic atmosphere for me to feel like I’m the one running in this song. The synths in this song are very driving and they sort of remind me of TV scores. I like the synth tricks that sound like helicopters overhead while this person is running. I like the ambiguous nature of this song thematically as well. I don’t really know whether this character is running away from or towards something. Whatever the true point of this song is, it puts me on edge in the best way, especially with the peak which leads us into Time.\n\nThe concept of time is something we cannot avoid and Pink Floyd discusses this very well on the song, Time. The maddeningly busy chimes at the beginning of this track is a fantastic opener for a very unnerving song. The guitars kick in for an almost Western movie vibe. The drum solo makes this song feel very big and imposing, just like time itself. When the lyrics kick in, they’re some of the deepest and most relatable on this album. I like the theme of time speeding up as you get older and all the time you waste in life. The guitar solo on this track is long, but it held my attention and felt very large. The Breathe reprise was a nice touch as well, bringing home the theme of a wasted life.\n\nThe Great Gig In The Sky is a very pretty song. The piano in the beginning is very pretty and it is only accented with the slurry guitars. When Clare Torry’s beautiful vocals hit, I was floored. Her erratic yet hauntingly beautiful vocals felt like an angel was taking me to a soulful heaven. The atmosphere this song builds is surreal all thanks to this voice. Near the end of the track, it starts to beautifully taper off while still maintaining its beauty. The whispered line at the end perfectly sums up the theme of death and the afterlife on this song. The echoing vocalizations near the end of the track are also a nice touch and they create a very pretty end to this first half of the album.\n\nMoney kicks off the second album with the “ka-ching” sound bites alternating between headphone channels. The bass lets us in on this groovy, sarcastic song with this delicious blues feel, and in 7/4 most of the time! The lyrics on this track give this sarcastic, sleazy tone which is perfectly fitting for this song and the band’s views on the subject. The sax solo is amazing, perfectly accenting the 12 bar blues feel. I love the long guitar solo and how it has multiple elements and moods, while still following the 12 bar blues formula that I am rather fond of. The changing time signatures on this track are very dynamic and add a new feel and new flavour to this song without much confusion in the way of musical ideas. The walking down bass line to close off the track is perfect to add to the theme of madness. Overall, I adore this track and I love to find new little musical nooks and crannies with each listen.\n\nI like the fade in from Money to Us and Them, as it is not an easy feat to change from a lively swing feel to slow and straight. I like being greeted by the pretty organs at the beginning. The sax solo is very relaxing and cool. The verses are mellow while the choruses are powerful but the song doesn’t surprise you with the sudden dynamic change. I like the anti-war message on this song, which makes this a time capsule of the thoughts and feelings of the youth in 1973 England. However, I don’t think it adds much to the theme of madness that this album has been building. The condemnation of war is also a little too obvious for my liking, which comes across as preachy. I still like this song very much, even though I believe it’s one of the weakest and the most obvious on the album.\n\nAny Colour You Like is the polar opposite of Us And Them in the sense that you will never know the true meaning of this song for sure. This song is the only true instrumental song on the record which adds to its thematic ambiguity. The synths on this track are some of the prettiest I’ve heard on this album. The synths are so layered and busy, but it doesn’t feel abrasive, it just feels like I’m falling into this psychedelic realm. I also like the guitar solo on this track. Although it doesn’t wow me as much as the synths do, the effects on the guitar sound pretty great. This song adds to the theme of madness as well as it feels like the world is melting around me and meaning doesn’t matter anymore.\n\nBrain Damage has this amazingly abrasive first hit of sound which feels like I just got hit in the head with a blunt object. The song immediately returns to musical order. The whole vibe of this song screams “I’m going insane, but that’s fine by me” and I love it. The lyrics are as carefree as the instruments on this song and I can’t help but smile with this person who has clearly lost it. The laughing sound effect really brings this song into the main theme of insanity on this album. The line “I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon” is a nice touch for this song as the album comes to a close, with all its themes fleshed out, especially due to the conclusion this album makes towards the end.\n\nThe closing track, Eclipse, is definitely a zoom out on this rock solid album. It keeps up the carefree nature of Brain Damage, but it feels heavier to end this album with a bang. All of the musical elements that were on the album prior to this song are in full force on this song as well, which is very busy, but it all makes sense. The track is very groovy and psychedelic with its repetitive lyrics and triplet feel. The heartbeat sounds are fantastic, as the album finishes where it started on Speak To Me. It’s a great closing track and it wraps this album in a neat and tidy way.\n\nThis album is very well made and I’m glad that it influenced the music world for decades to come. It feels like a look back into the history of rock music and I thoroughly enjoyed walking through history. I love the psychedelic, almost relaxing vibe of this album with dark themes and lyrics. The production quality on this album is stellar and creative. Nothing is too pronounced in the mix, everyone can be heard and adds something to each track. The flow between tracks is impeccable, flawlessly transitioning from one song to the next. I like the theme of madness on this album as well, especially the conclusion that it makes. “There is no dark side of the moon really/Matter of fact, it’s all dark”; we were all insane all along. This album is timeless due to the fact that we, as a society, still deal with insanity and keeping ourselves together 46 years later. My only complaints with this album are I wish the themes on this album were more watertight and I wish it built a deeper atmosphere. Also, I fear that some of the tracks don’t stand well on their own, which is can be the curse of great flow in an album. Overall, while The Dark Side Of The Moon is not a perfect album, it’s a stepping stone in music history and a very solid, enjoyable album.', '', 'https://www.instagram.com/christenedmusic/']",4.00 stars

I didn't sign up to play Alice in the school play.\n\nThis album taught me that my idea of music, at the time, wasn't what it actually is. Before this, all I knew were standard popular music tunes that follow a certain mold. Nothing wrong with this. But as the line says, I was waiting for something to show me the way.\n\nBreaking into the verses of Time is one of many examples of high notes this band reaches during the album's wonderful run time. At the end of it all, this is rock 'n' roll and this is a style of music defined by iconic musical moments. They don't get much better than the burst of starlight that is the legendary solo on this tune.\n\nAnd the best part, this cinematic element of amazing moment after amazing moment occurs regularly.\n\nSo much so that every song expertly weaves into new ideas and the next tune, the master class of progressive rock song smithing.\n\nI think this hits the highest point on the amazing Brain Damage, with the epic climax chorus that defines this band's current style. No two Floyd records sound alike, but this one is distinct above the rest. Nothing tops the idea that music can be of any form and style as long as it has substance. That it can be from anything and nothing, all during one composition. During one album listening session. During an entire career, spanning decades.\n\nThat's why, the cover art is so iconic. The design is simple and elegant. But, it means so much more. And to me, seeing this record this way makes the light being split by the prism a perfect summary of what you hear.\n\nThat fucking cash register sample always gets me.

While I often tend to rate pretty well and highly, this goes beyond most other 5 star albums. It's not without flaw, but songs like Money, Time, Us and Them and Brain Damage are just so iconic and well made that they could each carry a single album in my opinion. To have that many strong, well produced, creative and genius songs on a single album is just beyond belief. If you were to listen to their albums before TDSM it just shows the strength that came from their previous releases.

ChickenHat,"['It\'s telling that one of the most popular and iconic pieces of popular media of the 20th century is a concept album about how modern society makes us miserable. I suspect that a key to its popularity is how it doesn\'t compel the listener to actually do anything about it: ""Down and out / it can\'t be helped that there\'s a lot of it about"" and ""hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way"" are mostly typical of the album\'s observations. It\'s as if Roger Waters looked into the void at the heart of Western civilization and (in stark contrast to the scabrous cynicism of his later works) let out a half-hearted sigh. ""Oh dear...""\n\nHelping to articulate the album\'s mood of resigned despair and inevitable failure is the most listenable music of Pink Floyd\'s career. Much has been made of the album\'s Audiophile-wet-dream production, but beyond the cool sound effects you also get some of the tightest songwriting this band ever came up with. For the first (and, unfortunately, last) time, David Gilmour and Richard Wright\'s vocal harmonies finally have consistently excellent melodies to work with, and the mellow folkie influence that they\'d run into the ground is given the boot in favor of a slicker, almost Americanized soft rock sound. It\'s easy to see how this album became a staple of every middle-class household in the modern world - its combination of existential malaise and plush comfiness is the middle-class experience in a nutshell.']",4.00 stars

It lands neatly in my top 100 albums of all time, but I\'m almost embarrassed to admit something like that...it\'s so universally liked, it almost seems pointless to review it. But here I am.\n\nIt\'s a bit of a slow start, with ""Speak to Me"" sort of being an overture, introducing themes of the album (interviews, heartbeats, chimes), and ""Breathe"", which is literally a slow song. ""Breathe"" is a great introduction to the themes of the album though, of existentialism and what it means to be alive. I constantly change my opinion on ""On the Run"". On one hand, it\'s literally just sound effects of airplanes and footsteps, but on the other hand the synths make it sound like a thrilling movie score. ""Time"" is, well, ""Time"", it\'s a radio smash hit and it serves as another well of themes for the album. The ""Breathe"" reprise is also a nice touch, giving more thematic purpose to the song. I never really liked ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", I thought it\'s kind of filler wailing--good wailing, but in the end it\'s just notes, a bridge to end the first side of the album.\n\nSide 2 opens with ""Money"", which is kind of a weird song, thematically, for the album. More cynical, I suppose? Reminds me of ""Have a Cigar"" or their later album, Animals. Still a fun song, though. ""Us and Them"" is the best track, with an endearing verse, an insane sax bridge, and lyrical themes of war and humanity. ""Any Colour You Like"" is a runner-up for best track, a psychedelic synth and guitar back-n-forth. ""Brain Damage"" feels like an early tribute to Syd Barrett, with psychedelic lyrics about insanity, and ""Eclipse"" closes the album and ties up the themes of the album (a bit ham-handedly, but I\'ll let it slide because it sounds nice).\n\nI know it\'s easy to circlejerk this album, but this genuinely is one of the best albums of all time.

What is music, what is listening, what is discovering, without the thrill of the chase? Having something truly defy expectations?\n\nI speak often of the bane of growing up wealthy. What is ‘success,’ in life , if you’ve spent your whole life wallowing in wealth, needn’t ever taking risks, thereby expected to ‘succeed’ in the monetary sense to such an extent that when you do - meeting expectations, not exceeding them - you end up significantly less happy than a kid who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, watched his siblings fall to drugs, mental illness, jail, while he was able to raise a middle class family - again, in the monetary sense - ‘modestly,’ though his story isn’t one of modesty whatsoever, it’s triumphant, it’s brilliant, it’s David vs. Goliath.

dirtydanreviews,"[""SO, while a 3.0 to the second highest rated album on rateyourmusic.com warrants an explanation, so many people agree with me that not only is Dark Side of the Moon not the best album of all-time, but it's not even, the best, most trippest, innovative Pink Floyd album. If I was a kid in 73' I probably would have shit my pants when this thing released and listened the crap out of the record until it got annoying. Which, unfortunately is sort of what happened to the younger generations that Pink Floyd and Dark Side of the Moon dawned upon. The music, was overplayed by mainstream rock stations, especially tunes like Money and Time. Of course we've heard, these tracks a billion times, unfortunately they're the best tracks on the record. And they've been overplayed in my lifetime to Jehoavah and back, so I've gotten annoyed by them, I skip them at this point in my listen throughs. The only time that I listen to these tracks is when other people play it. When listening through the record, Breathe (In the Air) has to be Dark Side of the Moon's best track. One of the most important things about music is it having an effect of leaving you wanting more. At a runtime of 2 minutes and change, Breathe has you craving so much of the Brit-rocks supersonic sound, Roger Water's deep, funky, groovy, hypnotic baselines. On top of his vocals which only seldom come in, so enjoy them while they last, because this is the highest point of the record. The simple lyrics that are repeated do a lot in their concise nature. Breathe, breathe in the air, don't be afraid to care. Leave, but don't leave me. Look around choose your own ground.\nAll words that are simple, complex, and profound at the same time. On the Run is a track that I personally enjoy quite a lot, but it simply seems like an extension of Breathe with no lyrics, focusing on the trippy instrumentals which add the sampling from the first track Speak to Me once again prophesying the lunacy motif which is substantial throughout the entire discography of Pink Floyd. And because it's an issue which effects humans so profoundly never real seems cheesy or gets old. Or at least I don't really think so. As I stated early Time and Money are tracks that have been played to death. Which is kind of ironic considering the theme of the record, life itself. Which I think is its most ironic measure yet. For the time, a record about life, that sounds this grandiose was innovative and incredible. In my opinion however, as a fan of the entire Floyd discography, I think the record pales in comparison lyrically and in many spots vocally to Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Animals, and Wish You Were Here, that stated, other than those releases Dark Side of the Moon is generally a well-rounded record lyrically. The majority of the music is focusing of the incredibly punctuating harmonies like the ones on Money and Time. My main qualm with the lyrics is their utter logically obvious statements about life. If you're going to make an album about life, I would love it to be more abstract, with perhaps more hypnotic lyrics, and vocal melodies. But their use of tape loops, and reoccurring motifs that were so obvious, enough for the average consumer to comprehend. Now they have themself a best-selling all-time album. This is the only reason it's considered one of the greatest albums of all-time. Unlike their other records, it doesn't have songs that are longer than 10 minutes. It continued to mention the most basic of themes plain and simple, lunacy. Not to mention the sometimes god awful, god and soul vocals on The Great Gig in the Sky. Which again is incredibly profound instrumentally. All the tracks on the record are insane! My favorite part of the entire record, personally is the finish Brain Damage/Eclipse. Which sums up the record in the most listenable rock songs I've ever heard. This entire record is highly listenable and relistenable. Primarily, because a. it's really easy to understand the base level message of the record (of course you can take whatever meaning you would like from the record, which could, in end take you anywhere) and b. the record sounds like it was of course made from a high budget; a lot of expensive, highly technical rock equipment that was ahead of its time and damn well should have made an incredible sounding record. Not to mention years of experience. This record is amazing, don't let my review deter from experiencing, if you haven't before. But, don't let this record, get in the way of other listenings. Not only in music in general, but in Floyd's discography. Meddle, Obscured by Clouds, Saucerful of Secrets, and Wish You Were Here are all great but The Wall is a masterpiece. And Roger Water's crown juul. Even Roger himself, would probably agree.""]",3.00 stars

Zwischen der ganzen Harmonie und der ausgefeilten Prog-Muckerei (die wohlweislich niemals übertreiben) kommer immer wieder erfrischend unkonventionelle Parts und Songs. Musikalisch ist das immer sehr gut gemacht, ""Money"" ist für mich ein Paradebeispiel dafür, wie ein 7/4-Takt geht.

I\'d say it\'s somewhere between 30-40, which is a good margin, but no way I\'d rank it among the best 10. I don\'t know if it\'s because I\'m relatively tired of some tracks here, probably I used to like it more back in the days. But hey, still a great record, without a doubt. Starting with ""Speak to Me"", an intro of more than 1-minute that I don\'t see the point of its existence. Maybe it was to create a paranoid or anxious feeling, but eh, not necessary. It is tangled with ""Breathe"", which is fucking brilliant. ""On the Run"" is alright, sounds like something Gong or Hawkwind could do, but it\'s not a significant piece compared to the rest. ""Time"" was one of the songs I stopped hearing constantly, but now, coming back to it, I notice how perfect it is, since its storytelling aspect to the genius lyrics. Might be my favorite track. ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" is a glimpse of heaven, there are no sung lyrics, it is a construction of trying to achieve grandiosity, and they did it. My favorite moment of it isn\'t even the screams, but before, when the old man speaks ""and I am not frightened of dying [...]"".\n\n""Money"" is the proper example of what I said about getting a bit tired of, and I\'d say it\'s an excellent song, but not a masterpiece for me anymore. ""Us and Them"" is very very nice but it never was a tune that I used to keep listening to when I wanted to listen to Pink Floyd. It leads to ""Any Colour You Like"", a cool instrumental piece mostly based on guitars, but not that great in my opinion. The last two tracks, ""Brain Damage"" and ""Eclipse"", are often considered a single song because they are probably the most dependant on each other. Both are truly wonderful, especially ""Brain Damage"", which I always admired for its efficiency to put us, listeners, inside the head of a madman. These are my brief comments on each of the tracks, it\'s a mostly positive evaluation, but I don\'t think it\'s a flawless album. Even so, I totally understand who says so. The guys say that all the previous releases were steps to DSOTM and it is, for certain, a well-imagined and well-executed work of art. P.S.: the most iconic cover of all time.', '']",4.50 stars
JakeAsfaw,"['Step onto the dark side of the moon with this album... you will never view alternative rock the same way again. Every track is like an album with in itself with different sections and words that tell stories about people and things. The quality of the songwriting is why this is an album. Imagine when in 1974 when this album came out listening to ""The Great Giggle Man in the Sky"". I would\'ve gone FUCKING BANANAS if heard that on the. It\'s much better than that Radiohead band that gets all the play on the radio(head) now. I must say that ""Us & Them"" is maybe the best song about sex I\'ve ever heard and I\'m not embarrassed to admit that I get several erections almost every time I hear it.\n\nThe reason King Crimson are my least favorite band is how they ripped off everything good about FLOYD but completely made it not as good at all. Maybe if Robert Smith stopped doing so many drugs, he could right original music and stop ripping off\n\nSo I was in high school the first time I heard this album. There was this teacher\'s assistant who asked me if I heard Dark Side, and I had to be honest and say no. Of course, he then strongly encouraged me to do so, and so I didn\'t have this blind spot any longer, I did. I kinda completely forgot what I thought about it. I liked it to some degree. Not sure how much.\n\nFast forward some time and now I have a retarded (not literally, mods) friend named Tony. His favorite band is Pink Floyd, and so he brings them up sometimes to convince me that The Wall is an album that human beings who were not in school in 1979 should listen to. Arguments then generally move into other Floyd album including this one, and after awhile, through the museum, I end up coming to the conclusion that this is the best Floyd album and just a great album at that. But that\'s not what I wanted to talk about.\n\n""Hello, class, I\'m hear to talk about a new album that came out recently called The Wall""\n\n""Why that album? Why not review an actually good Floyd album.""\n\n""Andrew, please stop interrupting Brandon and let him finish his presentation on this fine Purp Floyb album.""\n\n""Sighhhhhhhhh!""\n\n""That\'s it, Andrew, go the the principal\'s office.""']",3.50 stars

sunriseoversea,"[""Reviewed as part of my 'top albums from every year challenge' over on stickaroundpodcast.com/albumchallenge\n\n-------------------\n\nPink Floyd’s eighth album, The Dark Side of the Moon, is probably one of the most famous albums out there, and one you’ll hear repeated many times if you ask people what their favourite album of all time is. It’s an album that’s almost impossible to listen to outside of its almost mythical place in the zeitgeist. It’s also Pink Floyd’s best selling album, and one of the bst selling albums of all-time, with over 45 million copies sold. A concept album about ‘greed, time, death and mental ilness’ according to Wikipedia, it well and truly put Pink Floyd on the map.\n\nThe album opens with Speak to Me, a one minute introduction track that begins with a heartbeat and recordings of the band talking, before the sound of a helicopter hovers in and we drop into track two, Breathe (In the Air). Gilmour’s ‘uni-vibe’ pedal makes his axe sound like a futuristic slide-guitar, and we have the album’s first lyrics, an imagery dense poem about going with the flow. The last verse sums it up nicely:\n\nFor long you live and high you fly\nBut only if you ride the tide\nAnd balanced on the biggest wave\nYou race towards an early grave\n\nThe following On the Run is another soundscape piece, that whirling sound created by a Synthi AKS synthesiser, and the rest of the spacey soundscape was created in a whole host of interesting ways. The sound of a variety of vehicles flying around in an empty black night on another planet is quickly stopped as we hear an explosion, followed by the gradual introduction of a ticking clock, leading us into one of the album’s highlights. Time begins with a clatter of pendulums and other metal, which fades into an ominous ticking and booming of what I’m assuming is a synth. Pink Floyd continue to hammer home the fact they really are the masters of soundscapes with the rumble of a conga from ear to ear, before a more traditional rock arrangement enters alongside David Gilmour’s vocals. The song returns to the theme of Breathe, of making the most of now. It does so in a much darker way than Breathe though, something evident in the song’s last four lines:\n\n“Far away across the field/The tolling of the iron bell/Calls the faithful to their knees/To hear the softly spoken magic spells.” The song fades effortlessly into the epic The Great Gig In The Sky which features Clare Torry’s spectacular, traumatised sounding worldess vocal, which I used to find rather irritating but has now grown on me. The song’s title refers to heaven, and the soundscape underneath Torry’s vocal is rather heavenly, the soft piano chords are accompanied by the odd bass note, seemingly gliding across the cosmos. Torry’s vocal is angelic and cataclysmic all at once.\n\nThe we reach the first single on the album, Money. It opens with an incredibly innovative use of the sound of coins and a cash register to introduce its 7/4 time signature. It is the only song on the album that made the top 20, and in fact the only song in history to do so containing a 7/4 time signature. The song is a pretty blunt critique of commercialism, and features David Gilmour on absolute guitar god form when the song switches to 4/4, with solos that light up the piece like a Swiss firework display - go watch a firework display in Ascona and you’ll know what I mean.\n\nOk, we’ve critscised capitalism and the root of all evil, money. Now it’s time for war to come under the microscope in Us and Them, a song that for some reason is rarely in the conversation when talking about the greatest anti-war songs, but probably should be. We’re all just ordinary humans, the song emphatically dictates, and thus all war is senseless. Torry is back with backing vocals in what is one of the album’s hugest sounding songs, the end of each verse crescendoing into a burst of tuneful anger.\n\nThe album moves onto the keyboard an guitar solo led Any Colour You Like, which sparkles like a million possibilites, followed by Brain Damage, another song about former frontman Syd Barrett’s mental instability, before we end with Eclipse, a wholehearted list of how nothing really matters in the end, ‘for even the sun is eclipsed by the moon.’\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is a magnificent album. Even today, in 2020, the thing does not sound like it was recorded on this planet, the musical paintings it weaves belong to another universe. The Dark Side of the Moon is a timeless piece of art, it’s themes as universal as the stars.\n\nSong Picks: Time, Money, Us and Them, Breathe (In the Air)\n\n9.5/10\n\n--------------Original Review------------\n\nI can already tell there's going to be at least one Pink Floyd album I absolutely love, but this isn't quite it. I mean it's great, Gilmour's guitar is gorgeous, there's some great expansive tracks, and I like the way the vocals go with the ridiculously smooth instrumental performances. 'On The Run' doesn't add anything, and I find 'The Great Gig in The Sky' actively annoying. Those are my two main gripes that pull an otherwise excellent album down. I love how it covers a bunch of big topics in an interesting way. There's some truly gorgeous instrumental moments here too, I just wish 'The Great Gig In The Sky' didn't exist.\n\nSong Picks: Money, Time, Breathe, Us and Them\n\n8.4/10""]",4.50 stars

Where The Beatles had a colorful history, where the general public knows all the names and is aware of their work outside of the band, Pink Floyd doesn't have that. Roger Waters might be a familiar name to some, but overall Pink Floyd is only judged by their music alone. And the fact that young people today still have posters with the iconic album cover on their college dorm rooms, speaks to the timeless appeal of the songs.

NightBeast777,"['Вот я и попал. Поверьте мне, гораздо проще писать хвалебные рецензии на альбомы, которые не так хорошо известны обыденному слушателю. Чаще всего можно просто покидаться высокопарными прилагательными, провести пару аналогий с другими музыкальными трудами, воодушевить читателя несколькими образными сравнениями, — и вот она: практически идеальная рецензия на альбом, который знаю только я или же ещё несколько моих друзей. Данная рецензия, как бы хороша она была, не будет никем читаться, — в лучшем случае благодарный читатель лишь окинет её беглым взглядом, оценит обложку альбома и может даже послушает какой-либо приложенный к статье трек, — но этим всё и ограничится. Однако когда мне приходится писать о группе Pink Floyd, я заведомо создаю вокруг себя ажиотаж. Более того, когда я пишу об их эпохальном и, за неимением лучшего слова, гениальном творении – The Dark Side Of The Moon (даже название альбома стало нарицательным!).\n\nОб этой пластинке написано столько статей, что даже у вашего покорного слуги голова идёт кругом. Ни года не проходит без того, чтобы какой-либо именитый критик не называл этот альбом лучшим за всю историю человечества, ставя его выше таких, казалось бы, незыблемых столпов музыки как The Beatles – Revolver и The Beach Boys – Pet Sounds. За прошедшие несколько лет он умудрился выйти на второе место по мировым продажам, обогнав AC/DC – Back In Black, и я уверен, что ещё через несколько лет он обскочит и нынешнего лидера – Michael Jackson – Thriller. Почему? Потому что Pink Floyd это не просто музыкальный коллектив – это настоящий феномен. Уникум среди других прогрессивных коллективов, который умудрился записывать сверхсложную и навороченную музыку и одновременно завоёвывать сердца миллионов поклонников во всём мире. Их музыка трогает самые глубокие и спрятанные струнки нашей души, нежно касается тех чувств, от которых мы и сами зачастую прячемся в темноте невежества и, как-то ненароком, выдавливает слезу даже из самого черствого человека. Их музыка радует, печалит, пугает, злит, смешит, навевает чувства ностальгии и стремления к чему-то большему и воспитывает в нас вкус к красивой музыке, лишённой таких отвратных качеств как коммерциализация и примитивность. Секрет Pink Floyd понять практически невозможно: многие меломаны до сих пор задаются вопросом – почему именно они? Почему такого успеха смогли добиться именно они? Почему не Caravan, King Crimson или Van Der Graaf Genearator? Но, увы, даже у меня нет ответа на этот извечный вопрос. Возможно всё дело в том, что их музыка всегда была откровенной, будто они записывали её не для кого-то другого, а исключительно для себя и своих друзей. Будто они не просто хотели повыпендриваться, насилуя музыкальные инструменты всеми мысленными и немыслимыми способами, но просто сыграть красивую, сложную и запоминающуюся музыку.\n\nО гитаристе Pink Floyd Дэвиде Гилморе один мой хороший друг однажды сказал: возможно, он не настолько техничен как невероятный Джон Петруччи и возможно он не может играть так же быстро как Ван Хален или Стив Вай, но одна только нота, которую он издаёт при помощи обычной гитары, пронзает сердце слушателя так, как ни одно соло в мире. То же самое можно сказать и обо всей группе – она уникальна в своей простоте, но увлекательна в своей сложности. Парадокс? О, да, — разве есть что-то более интересное, чем парадоксы? Вам нужна история Pink Floyd? Увольте – зайдите в ближайший книжный магазин, пройдите в отдел музыки и выберите одну из десяти биографий группы, написанную английскими, американскими, русскими или даже азербайджанскими (да, у меня и такая есть!) критиками. В них вы найдёте всё: от раннего становления группы и принятия ими психоделической британской сцены (наверное, единственный период их творчества, который я не принимаю, — но лишь из-за того, что психоделический рок нужно слушать под галлюциногенами или другими веществами, раскрывающими сознание, а я такими вещами не увлекаюсь) до того момента когда в группе остался лишь вышеупомянутый Дэвид Гилмор. Именно там вы прочитаете, что именно употреблял Сид Баррет и насколько скандальным был Роджер Уотерс, — в общем, я, пожалуй, опущу все эти перипетии и перейду непосредственно к альбому.\n\nThe Dark Side Of The Moon – в этом альбоме идеально практически всё: от загадочного названия до стильной обложки, — всё в нём притягивает взгляд любопытного меломана, готового к новым музыкальным путешествиям. И пластинка не разочаровывает: как это часто бывает у прогрессивных групп, это не просто набор песен, а настоящая концептуальная работа, посвящённая тому, как обстоятельства современной жизни подминают под себя человека и доводят его до настоящего безумия. Кстати, довольно актуальная для группы тема, которую они поднимут чуть позже на другом своём эпохальном альбоме (ну-ка, все вместе!) – The Wall.\n\nВ музыкальном плане пластинка впитывает в себя практически весь спектр рок-жанров – от психоделического рока, сводящего с ума и ввергающего в пучину непонимания, до классического блюза, от которого даже самые прожжённые скептики бросаются в пляс. Речь идет, конечно же, о песне Money, которую не знает разве что ленивый, — настоящем хите как семидесятых, так и нашего с вами двадцать первого века. Совсем недавно группа перевыпустила сингл с этой песней на виниле и знаете что? – она снова заняла первые позиции музыкальных чартов, подмяв под свою мощь всех поп-див и замшелых электронщиков (не то чтобы я что-то имел против них). При всём при этом Money является чуть ли не самой просто песней на альбоме, как в музыкальном (хотя это соло на саксофоне просто ввергает в музыкальный экстаз), так и в лирическом плане: повествует она о том, какую власть деньги имеют над людьми, и какую двойственную роль они играют в нашем мире, одновременно являясь и благом, и грехом. Ничего нового, да? Но стоит сказать, что в концепцию альбома даже такая избитая тема вписывается замечательно.\n\nUs And Them – композиция совсем иного пошиба, настолько же глубока музыкально как и концептуально. Гипнотический ритм и вокал сменяются хоральным, скорее даже присущим мюзиклам, припевом. Так и со всем альбомом – он полон постоянных подъёмов и падений: сохраняя относительное спокойствие и мелодичность, группа умудряется укачивать нас на штормовых волнах; слушатель то мерно покачивается в мерный такт музыкального течения, то с криком срывается с многометровых волн, грозящих погрести его под своим многотонным весом. Us And Them, как собственно следует из названия, повествует о пренеприятной привычке человека делить собратьев на «своих» и «чужих», в результате чего на планете постоянно возникают недопонимания и кровавые конфликты. Из этого, конечно же, следует вывод, что все мы люди, и все мы повинуемся одним и тем же эмоциям и законам жизни. И время неумолимо стирает всех в нас порошок, забывая о наших условностях и поведенческих границах… Время?\n\nАх, да, Time – ещё один шедевр с альбома, который никогда не покинет ваше сознание, стоит лишь раз его услышать. *Внимание! Отступление от темы!!!* Time? Серьёзно? Time? Неужели нельзя было придумать хоть сколько то более оригинальное название? Да чтоб вам было известно в моём iTunes-е на данный момент существует 56 песен с точно таким же названием!! Come oooon!!! Сколько можно? Я, конечно, понимаю, что они хотели, чтобы весь альбом был выполнен в стильном минимализме, но Time – это уже слишком!!! Вы знаете, мне это уже искренне надоело, — названия песен не должны быть настолько примитивными и незапоминающимися. Уж пожалуйста, если вы так много вкладываете в свою музыку, то давайте сделаем то же самое и для заглавий!! Goddamit!!! *Николай Чувиков просит у вас прощения за сей гневный порыв и возвращается к своей рецензии* Итак, да, Time. Пожалуй, время это единственная сила во Вселенной, которая способна потягаться с таким явлением бытия, как смерть. Оно обволакивает нас и несёт сквозь минуты и года, попутно перемалывая наши мечты и стремления и даря нам минуты радости и счастья, чтобы потом навсегда ввергнуть нас в объятия космоса, из которого все мы родились. Поверьте мне, каким-то образом этой песне удаётся передать все эмоции и настроения, связанные у человека с неумолимостью времени. Стильный, размеренный ритм, аккуратные, но при этом задорные гитары, играют в прятки с нежным и отчаянным вокалом, разбивающим сердца и одновременно вселяющим в нас желание существовать. Pink Floyd всегда были группой противоречий, но нигде больше это так не заметно как на композиции Time.\n\nОднако самым главным достижением альбома лично я считаю тот шедевр, который участники группы озаглавили The Great Gig In The Sky. Здесь нет никакой лирики, никакого посыла – просто музыка. Музыка, ввергающая вас в настоящее путешествие к далёким звёздам и настолько же близким нейронам вашего мозга. Композиция начинается медленно и размеренно, будто бы успокаивая вас и давая время подумать над тем, что вы слышали до этого. Но в один миг она доходит до апофеоза всего альбома, когда музыка достигает самых волнующих высот, а неподражаемый и сверхмощный женский голос Клэр Торри возносит слушателя на самое небо, где обыденность становится лишь страшным сном, а действительно прекрасное окружает и успокаивает его. Это лишь слова, дорогие мои, — если вы никогда не слышали этого творения, то немедленно бросайте все свои дела и нажимайте кнопочку «Play» — вы не пожалеете.\n\nО The Dark Side Of The Moon можно говорить бесконечно: я лишь кратко упомянул о четырёх песнях, которые на мой скромный взгляд (да какой скромный, — у меня же мания величия!) являются лучшими с пластинки, но там есть ещё много треков, несомненно заслуживающих вашего внимания: On The Run, Any Colour You Like, Brain Damage, Eclipse – каждая из них уникальна по своему и определённо достойна своего маленького абзаца в любой рецензии. Однако мы ограничены количеством строк, а потому мне уже приходится сворачиваться. Как можно резюмировать всё вышесказанное? Да никак на самом деле – это один из тех редких случаев, когда и критики, и благородные меломаны, и напыщенные снобы, и даже обыденные слушатели уже всё сказали за меня. The Dark Side Of The Moon – это уникум среди всех музыкальных творений, который оказал непереоценимый вклад в развитие музыки и искусства в целом. Никогда не слышали этот альбом? Тогда зачем вы ещё читаете мою бредятину?! – скорее в магазин за диском или винилом!!!\n\nP.S.: Уважаемые женщины, так как у нас на носу праздник женской эмансипации (Кхм, 8 Марта), то позвольте дать вам немного бестолковый, но всё равно полезный совет. В миру бытует легенда, что каждый мало-мальски адекватный мужчина в глубине души любит Pink Floyd. При этом он может быть электронщиком, рэпером, панком, металлистом, рокером, попсовиком, шансонье или же просто всеядным меломаном, — но среди всего прочего он обязательно должен любить Pink Floyd. Поэтому, если хотите убедиться, что ваш возлюбленный — адекватный мужчина, просто спросите его: «Дорогой, а ты любишь Pink Floyd?», и если в ответ вы получите что-то вроде «Да кому нужен этот хлам?» или, что ещё хуже, «А кто это?», то насторожитесь: он может оказаться не тем за кого себя выдаёт (если вы понимаете, о чём я…). Внимание: автор не несёт ответственности за эту легенду и на самом деле считает её красивой выдумкой. Однако чем чёрт не шутит… Особенно когда он уже пару раз убеждался в её правдивости…\n\n10/10', 'https://vk.com/moscowmeltdown']",5.00 stars

mookid,"['Any record nerd has memories of formative experiences to this album, even folks who don\'t like it anymore. It\'s trite to even say what I like about it because we\'ve all appreciated the same details since it\'s among the most celebrated studio LPs ever. I used to drill facts into my brain about it down to the wrong ""your"" on Money in the gatefold. Loved it when I was 14, then rebelled against it when I thought I was really smart, then realized that pubescent me was alright. People tend to overthink their way out of seeing what\'s good about it, try to set aside the reputation and it should be clear that it\'s magnificent and deserves its status. I mean it\'s Dark Side. Tyler burned me a Maxell CD-R of this in 2004 and I first played it in Debbie\'s basement on her TV that had a DVD player and I sat there quiet and alone listening to it while the other kids did the group project I was supposed to be working on. And now I\'m 26 and still saying fuck it and throwing it on after coming home drunk from the kitty cat klub at 2:30am and lighting up a bowl to this which is still a juvenile guilty pleasure ya know? I am hereby obligated to 5 star it.\n\ne 12/29/2018 ok I\'ve been coming back to this album for 15 years and gone through periods of loving it and not wanting to hear it at all and lately I\'ve been playing it again. Weirdest thing. Favorite moment right now I think is that last section of the guitar solo in the middle of Time where the vocal backing comes in and the drums pull back, every 14 year old with a strat dreams of playing that part. They stepped up so much on this record compared to previous efforts which I certainly am into but here they got some attitude, they really became rock gods. Big gutsy guitar solos and just a cooler sound like having a track with a wordless vocal performance. Even considering how good their other albums are there\'s still something really unusually perfect about how this one came together.']",5.00 stars

This album, especially it\'s second half, feels like a singular odyssey.\n\nThis album, to beat a dead horse, is simply not as IMPORTANT as it was originally perceived to be by critics, both professional and amateur. The album is #2 all time on this site, and I am afraid that this is probably more the result of marketing inertia and it\'s well-known chart performances than it is with the merits of the music itself. In fact, it is utterly non-unique, a continuation of the sound that Pink Floyd had started developing already in Atom Heart Mother and had already continued in Meddle.\n\nFinal verdict: 5/10 [very middle of the road]; 2.5 stars']",2.50 stars
Borbs,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'If anything, I think this is one of those albums that over time you’ll end up loving more or just hating more depending on how you decide to explore music. Essentially, Dark Side of the Moon would be everyone’s first exposure when talking about Pink Floyd in general, whether they’ve heard of the album or not. It’s almost unavoidable to see the now iconic album art whenever you reference them. This album is good, good as in the best way to introduce yourself to Pink Floyd. That being said, if you bother to check out the rest of their discography, you’ll not only find albums that can blow this one out of the water, you will also pinpoint exactly where the band fell. But what does Dark Side leaves us by the way?\n\nWell, you get a mixed bag of good tracks, tracks that should’ve been left out and tracks that should not even be on this album. “But it’s a concept album” I hear you say, sure in order to understand the concept you must have the songs that compose that idea. If the whole point of the album is to explore the worries of a daily life and the dull repetition of it, then this album does not do a good job at that. Mostly due the themes and messages of this album are very conflicting with the members themselves, especially with Roger Waters. But let’s just pretend for a moment that, the lyrics in this album do not exist, which was a main selling point of the album back then. Well, for one I do not enjoy most of the backing vocals when it comes to this album. They often distract the main sound or idea, it is completely pointless to add one more layer to an already powerful instrumental. Most annoyingly though, Us and Them . I’m not saying Doris Troy, Lesly Duncan and Liza Strike are bad vocalists and all, but the reason they don’t really fit this record is because you already have a grandiose sound on most of the tracks. Oddly enough, the best tracks here seem to be the ones related to Syd, Brain Damage/Eclipse works as a powerful closer to a seemingly dull album. If it could’ve maintained the sound of these two tracks, I personally feel I would like this a lot more. But I guess that’s just me crazy talking, right?\n\n5/10']",2.50 stars

On the other hand, the only thing that is more pathetic than idolizing dark side will be to degrade schizophrenics, like Roger waters did to Syd Barret in his so-called masterpieces. His brutality is a shame for the universal left.\n\nHowever, it's Pink Floyd's fans that forced me to hate Dark side. The glory has killed the album; it might have been a fine, forgotten, even fare 70's work. But this ridiculous crowns that this mediocre wears might have drive both minds of a schizophrenic mind. 'A significant description of madness' - really? In the very same year that gave us Berlin, Aladdin Sane, Raw Power?! Dark side does not make this subject accessibleת but flat and meaningless, with pseudo-sophisticated lyrics such as 'I like to be here than I can', 'You lock the door/ And throw away the key /There's someone in my head but it's not me.'\n\nWhat was it in waters' head that made him write shit like that? Was it Robert Moog's spirit, that wanted to revenge Pink Floyd after violently abusing his wonderful synthesizer in 'Any colour you like'? Was it an extremely stupid white trash, that wanted to gratitude the band after shamefully whitening the black music? I swear that the moon is whiter then this lame 'grooves', and I'm talking about it's bright side. I guess this is some other questions to our brain scientists, that will have quite a busy day; I hope that their brain will still be able to work after listening to this aggressive digging 'on the run'.\n\nWith a standard, homogeneous orchestration, charisma-less singing and lack of progress, theres nothing progressive in Pink Floyd's sound, especially not in 1973, the year of Brain Salad Surgery and the brilliant amazing Selling England by the Pound, that with it's direct political references is more universal than this empty bullshit. In fact, it is kind of a retarded rock, that takes us back to the days of the tum-tum, in which music was not yet a form of art but a communication mean used for commercial purposes. And no, this seemingly creative 7/4–4/4 is not an argument; the 4/4 in the solo expose what this song really is: a pointless standard white-funk with a lot of show-off and decorating.\n\nI give this 2 stars because some of Pink Floyd's work is even worst, and because of the nostalgia. I have also been a 14 years old bourgeois schizophrenic teenager, you know; then I discovered Syd Barret.\n\nFor a conclusion, a link for my favorite track in the album, money:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETxmCCsMoD0""]",2.00 stars

latechrysanthemums,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'There\'s a term people use for this album. I think you know were I\'m going here. The term is the word ""overrated."" It means to have a higher opinion that it is really deserved. i\'m not saying I don\'t use the phrase myself on occasion, but man, that\'s some bullshit. Is an album overrated for being simple or not enough thought but to exceed what was expected? Something like that, of that sort. Here, I could totally fucking disagree. Is this album overrated or gaining the praise it rightfully deserves? I\'m here to tell you that it just isn\'t overrated, not at all, actually. Pink Floyd is one of the biggest names, not in just music, but in everything. You could know absolute dick about music but you\'ve heard the chords and instrumentations of this \'rock\' group, perhaps Hey You or Have a Cigar or really any song from any of their albums from 1973-79 on the radio. Also, the fact when you see a lot of people wear Pink Floyd memorabilia and they can\'t tell you who Syd Barrett is, or really any member of the group. I can see when this term overrated can come into play, but that\'s because this is the direction people take this album. But if you have actually listened to this album, hopefully you can hear me out that\'s it\'s not overrated but it hits all the marks well, maybe too well, maybe too perfect. Every song and every second is executed in the way you wish most albums are, but realistically, there\'s just very few in history that can compete with this one. There\'s the songs where it makes sense they will become hits that will always be constantly played, but the album as a whole ventures through different underlying themes. Time states the obvious, but the strikingly true lyrics backed by the mellow sounds of synths and Gilmour\'s vocals do make you realize about something you thought you already knew. Money talks about how it\'s more evil than amoral, but how your state of mind should be when handling the medium. It can be straightforward and have those underlying themes, but it does transition with every step it takes. Us and Them really showed more of violence and war, but this song is not like the rock opera The Wall, the song makes itself its own character, it doesn\'t have to resolute with war, but it can if you want it to be. The songs rather are just next to one another than really speaking of one another, but from beginning to end, you\'re glad it was this exact order and the exact length, and so forth. I also must say that this group never was going for the fame or popularity, and they never thought this album who be at least a fraction of how popular it became. It makes sense and is completely shocking simultaneously. Pink Floyd surely is a fingerprint in the database of music in the last 50 years or so, because there REALLY is no band that has had the story quite like this one. There a band that knows what its like where no one\'s really getting it and where you\'re the biggest band in the world. What it\'s like to make strange progressive rock music and to make pop rock music that marks its name on the Billboard charts. This is the album that really binds it all together, showing the music that they\'ll make later but still showing hints from the past. The album that really just filled in the hole of popular music in history, like spackle. I know I\'m stating things that you really should already know about the album, but sometimes people don\'t want to get too much into detail about an album that carries the weight like this one does. So I\'ll do the best I can to break it down for you.\n\nThat album starts with the short composition that is composed by drummer Nick Mason, entitled Speak to Me. It foreshadows sounds and themes to come, and jumps right into the mellow scene that is Breathe. David Gilmour makes sure his voice is in tune with the soft sounds that make up this album, and welcomes you with Breathe. Very simple and not very long-at-all lyrics, but every word sang is all that\'s need for you, and then the instrumental On the Run. The instrumentals near the beginning are kind of just getting you warmed up for the bigger parts of the album. It builds suspension for me. On the Run has out-of-this-world keyboards and tape effects from keyboardist Richard Wright, seems to have come out from a 1980s video game. It then crashes and just explodes, implying whatever you want it to imply. The explosion could just mean that something has died but that you will be taken to a different stratosphere, or maybe that the band is ready to get to the next song. I must tell you, the rest of the album is more promising, but even the beginning has so much to say.\n\nThen, shhhh... it\'s really quiet. You can hear a pin drop kind of quiet. Hopefully you can go back in time and remember the first time ever listening to this album like me. You\'re silent because the album has got a hold of you like that. Then BING! BONG! BING! clocks are ringing and ringing and ringing on Time. It\'s loud but softens and then the band kicks into gear. It\'s still soft, and the drum fills from Mason are rather just incredible, then to just rock out with the psychadelic sound that is Pink Floyd. You know the lyrics, and every word speaks well with time itself. It\'s rather painfully true but extremely realistic, and we just have to relate with it. The songs says it\'s over, and then you hear the reprise of Breathe. You\'re so glad to hear another verse of Breathe and I can\'t remember at the moment a better reprise on an album than this. It brings a vibe that connects with the song Time, they just go together like two catfish in a skillet, one could say. The first half ends on a marvelous note, that marvelous note that is The Great Gig in the Sky. The piano that Wright uses to start off the song is just too strikingly beautiful, complimented by the mellowed out guitar sounds that slide from the guitar of Gilmour and the bass notes that bounce in from Roger Waters. Recordings of other people\'s voices come into play where there needs to be, adding the atmospheric ambience to it. It can crescendo where it really can\'t get any crazier, but it can soften to the point where your heart just might break in half. Clare Torry just accomplished this song by making it her own, giving that haunting feel that comes with goosebumps that I really couldn\'t have asked from any other female singer. The vocals say so much emotionally and musically for being non-lexical. Alan Parsons suggested her for being a session musician. She really knew all the in and outs of what she can do with the Pink Floyd tune, and you really didn\'t need a big name to do this, you needed just her.\n\nYou hear coins falling and a check register opening and... of course silly, you\'re listening to Money! I did state the subject earlier, but let me just say this. The bass riff is as memorable as John Entwistle\'s bass riff on My Generation, once you hear it, it\'s stuck with you for life, in a good way, of course. The fading out guitar all just collides and piles on to complete the sound of the song. The song is fun and playful but can be taken seriously, as if that was possible. Somehow, the fun near the end of the song is faded out with the vivid, bright sounds of synths as we are taken to Us and Them. The song takes it\'s time and its sound can just have you lost and you\'re surrounded and comforted by the sound of Dick Parry\'s saxophone. The song is slow, but every word makes its point clear and will make sure this will stick with you. For a very slow song it becomes ambitious and just burst into a full, indulging sound, and then it just breaks through into the keyboards of Any Colour You Like. The sound that just layers on is truly a sound of only the future can speak. A song I didn\'t pay too much attention too when first discovering the ideals that are in the album, but it has really lingered on to me, for better or for worse (for better). Brain Damage has lyrics that don\'t make sense but there\'s still something to get out of it. no matter the scene or if the concept shifts into a different hue, you will always find your way back out of the rabbit hole, in some form. Then with the very short but just the right way to close this out, Eclipse talks of all you can do and how it\'s connected to the dark side of the moon. My dad would always tell me to turn up the speakers all the way up to hear the end, and I could just make out...\n\n"" There is no dark side of the moon really\nMatter of fact it\'s all dark ""\n\nI always tell people that, and I don\'t know what I\'m supposed to get out of the fact now I know that the moon is just all dark. I guess I\'ll just keep on wondering. Sometimes an album just has that thing about it where it\'s for the musicians to know and for you to find out.\n\nThe album needed nothing more and nothing less, just the formality it is in. It really was just in at the right place at the right time, I couldn\'t have said that any better. For everything this has done in music and for listening to this all these years, I\'m glad it was one of the first albums I ever heard, remembering listening to this and The White Album at around six years old. I guessed I was just spoiled with listening to the best because all these years later, artists try to make too many different things that are complex or creative. I guess I\'ll just have to stick the the overrated side of the stick.']",5.00 stars

wave_of_mutilation,"[""“There is no dark side of the moon, really. Matter of fact, it’s all dark.” –Gerry O’Driscoll, Abbey Road Studios doorman\n- - - - - - - - - -\nAs I grow older, I find myself thinking more frequently about my existence, my future, and my overall purpose. Who am I? What am I here for? What will I be like 10 years from now? 20? Will I be (more) insane 30 years from now? How will I die? When will I die? Is death something to be afraid of? Is it every man for himself in this world? What path will I choose? What path should I choose? These are just a few of my unanswered questions.\n\nThe Dark Side of The Moon doesn’t do much to answer those questions, but it makes me feel as if my concerns are justified in a way. Thankfully, there’s a lot more to this record than the philosophy. It excels in practically every aspect musically. There are so many noteworthy characteristics of this record to point out, I don’t even know where to begin. The production, the songwriting, and the instrumentation are all highly appreciated elements of this fantastic record, and for very good reason. But, I think my favorite aspect about Dark Side is that it presents a fascinating outlook on human life.\n- - - - - - - - - -\nMarch 1st, 2016 marks the 43rd Anniversary of the US release of The Dark Side of The Moon. It’s been nearly half a century since its release, yet Dark Side’s reputation seems to only grow stronger with time rather than diminish. There's actually a simple explanation for this - Pink Floyd towered above their contemporaries. They were undeniably so much more than the average rock band. I think a big flaw of 1970’s rock music – one that I believe should be pointed out much more often – is that a considerable amount of the more commercial releases tend to be overambitious to the point where the songs and albums are unlistenable because they’re so pompous and pretentious, and, rather than gather significant critical acclaim, are left behind and dismissed as products of their time.\n\nDark Side isn’t a product of its time. It’s not even close to being one, and for a couple of reasons. For one, it actually balances ambition with high-quality lyrics, instrumentation, and songwriting. Yes, the band did try to make a grand, monumental statement – which is probably what ruins the record for some people – but Pink Floyd actually had the talent to back up their ambitions.\n\nBut, here’s the biggest reason why tens of millions of copies of Dark Side have been sold. Here’s the biggest reason why Dark Side is still considered by thousands and thousands of people to be the holy grail of rock music, the be-all end-all. Here’s the reason why the 5 star ratings for this record outnumber the 4.5 ratings by a more than 2 to 1 margin.\nIt’s because – and as silly as it may sound to the naysayers and even some of the fans – The Dark Side of The Moon is phenomenally relatable. It seems unlikely that anyone – much less the nearly 25,000 people on this website alone that gave this record a rating of 4 or above – could relate to four cynical, pessimistic, philosophical, and arguably pretentious Englishmen. Or, at least, it would be difficult to understand this album if it weren’t for the ingenious lyrics, and the perspective this record offers on our world. Our lives.\n\nUs.\n\nI get chills every time I listen to “Time” and Wright sings the lyrics, “you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today / and then one day you find then years have got behind you / no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun”. The line, “every year is getting shorter”, is universally relatable.\n\n“All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be”. A fascinating point of view, from what is possibly my favorite track on this record, “Breathe”. Hell, even the insanity-themed lyrics on “Brain Damage” are partially understandable. Everyone’s at least a little insane.\n\nI could go on and on. To word it simply, Dark Side contains the best lyrics I’ve ever heard on a rock record. Even when ignoring the lyrics, there’s still a lot I could talk about. I could discuss the first time I heard Dark Side of The Moon (about 2 years ago), how it completely changed my perception of music at the time, and how I would do practically anything to erase whatever memories of the album I have just so I could listen to the record for the first time again. I could talk about the wonderfully vivid soundscapes, the jazzy, psychedelic world of Pink Floyd. I could talk about Alan Parsons’s amazing production. I could talk about the interview excerpts scattered throughout the album, an undeservedly under-appreciated element. I could talk about how all of these components help give The Dark Side of the Moon a sense of completeness, probably the most of any rock record. But, I think my favorite thing to talk about when it comes to this record is what it means to me, and my interpretation of this record can be summarized in five words.\n\nLife is pretty damn strange.\n\n9/10""]",4.50 stars

And now here I am, writing a review of The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nActually there\'s a lot of good cases for it being just that. It\'s Pink Floyd\'s greatest album with ease and this is a band that also made Wish You Were Here and The Wall and I\'ll throw Animals there as well. Even if you don\'t prefer it over those other albums it\'s so culturally significant it\'s basically transcended the album-experience, staying on the charts for years and influencing, as well as deeply affecting people for two generations and counting. There\'s an album that comes every era that\'s just undeniable, that defines that generation for what it\'s worth. Dark Side of the Moon is one of those albums.\n\nIt\'s also the peak of Pink Floyd\'s highly creative 1970s-timeline, capturing just the time after they broke sonic ground on Meddle and before Roger making the music his own podium for his admittedly great, but pretentious vision in the Wish You Were Here—Animals era, where it was all downhill from there with one album taking itself more seriously than the next.\n\nAnd I mean even that wasn\'t a bad thing originally, it resulted in their three most conceptually ambitious -- and successful at that -- albums in the seventies. But what Dark Side of the Moon did better than Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, was capturing a time and a place; a creative atmosphere into 45 minutes of effortless cross-fading songs, delves into Musique Concréte and a concept that manages to be topical, climactic (thanks to the brilliant ending stretch) and still leave itself up for interpretation. Seriously, as far as writing goes, music has rarely achieved this kind of a genius in saying just enough to say it all, while still not saying too much.\n\nI\'ve used grand terms when praising The Dark Side of the Moon, but really I\'m just the messenger. What attests to these points the best is two things, the amount of people still recognizing the album as one of the greatest of all time, and the amount of music fans picking other albums as Floyd\'s magnum opus in attempts to be different. I\'m not one to judge personal preference though, mind ye, I just think there\'s a lot of viable cases for Dark Side of the Moon being the best, I do. You could take it\'s great popular status out of the equation and still make those points. It\'s always been such an irrelevant factor of it. It seems almost coincidental that they ever got as popular as they did with this album, out of all their albums.

Explico brevemente mi opinión y teniendo en cuenta que no es mi álbum favorito personal, porque tengo alguno por encima.\n\nPara empezar seguramente ningún álbum antes de 1973 había sonado tan fresco y sofisticado en cuanto a producción, simplemente parece un álbum recien sacado en el siglo 21. Por ejemplo si nos fijamos en ""Money"" la cantidad de matices de producción es increible, tienes que estar muy concentrado y metido en la música para coger todo. ""Any Colour You Like"" también destaca mucho en este aspecto. La innovación en el estudio también estuvo muy presente creando este álbum, se usaron loops de sonidos de todo tipo y sintetizadores punteros de la época, Gilmour y Roger salsearon mucho antes de ponerse a grabar, los dos genios que destacan del grupo.\n\nSegundo punto es el concepto, seguramente estamos ante el álbum conceptual más cuidado y mejor ejecutado de la historia, con los puentes entre canciones bordados, tiene que fluir, y éste fluye como la seda, delicadamente, así deberían ser los grandes álbumes conceptuales. Hay álbumes contados que unan todas las canciones del disco, muy poquitos.\n\nUn punto más a favor es ""The Great Gig In The Sky"", aquí hay que dar mucho crédito a Richard Wright por componer uno de los temas más emocionantes de la historia, es pura rabia y corazón de Claire Torry acompañada por un piano muy apacible, una obra maestra y el punto más alto del álbum simplemente hay que escucharlo no se puede explicar.\n\nPara terminar el final del álbum es de los más épicos que he escuchado, otros finales inolvidables por ejemplo ""Abbey Road"" ""Quadrophenia"" ""Days Of Future Passed""... Aquí ""Brain Damage"" y ""Eclipse"" se fusionan para cerrar un álbum que asombró al mundo nada más salir y sigue haciéndolo hasta el día de hoy, que parece mentira que en esos años se hiciese algo tan grande y ambicioso y que saliera simplemente perfecto.\n\nQue lo disfrutéis, un saludo.']",5.00 stars
laranra,"['PROGRESSIVE ROCK\n\nI don\'t agree with that idea stating this is Pink Floyd\'s masterpiece. I neither put it at the opposite extreme. No, it\'s not a bad album. What a little praise for such a monument! many would say. To tell the truth, I\'m not an enthusiast of symphonic rock, which doesn\'t mean I cannot appreciate the sonic finds of a band that, with its light and shade, have offered both landmarks in studio experimentation and a bunch of everlasting melodies.\n\nThe album, more than lyrically, SOUNDS conceptual. This is another reason for suspicion if it weren\'t for its solid flow which makes impossible to stop it once it starts its turning. Moreover, I sometimes think it sounds so calm it bores, but in truth, I don\'t pretend to be unjust. In fact, it rises intensity gradually somehow, until it bursts out in the soul choirs of ""Great Gig in the Sky"" and in ""Money""\'s guitar solo. I like that indeed. Just as everything that\'s not directly related to the hollow celebration Dave Gilmour hurried up to add to the band\'s sound once he got rid of Syd Barrett. It\'s curious that, whilst in their first albums without the lysergic little genius they seemed not dare to leave completely aside the founding postulates of the band, in this work of pharaonic sound and magnetism they take out their masks and offer a more than evident proof of what Pink Floyd was going to be according to their most symphonic and tremendous side. Yes, the title didn\'t deceive.\n\nThis album meant the culmination of a trip with departure in the children book The Wind in the Willows (Kenneth Grahame, 1908) and destination in the film 2001: A Space Odissey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968). Well, that\'s what they\'d like it to be, since referring to Kubrick\'s philosophical depth seems a little bit too much for a band that got lost in its airs and didn\'t appreciate the irony, the perversity and the exquisite taste of Syd Barrett\'s madness. And all this makes this lesson on space gospel more surprising and overwhelming.\n\nIn conclusion, with all its lights and shadows, the album cannot fill up the title. A title that is so evocative and appopriate that it hurts to see it applied to this work. And precisely due to all this I cannot abandon it in the oblivion of record mistakes. There are too many of that type all around, and they make possible to estimate the vapours of authenticity emanating from a work that, one way or another, will outlive us.

The_Deepblue,"['10\n\nWhen I was hooked on ""Dark Side of the Moon"" it never felt right to go in and listen to just one song. I\'d put it in, not even skipping ""Breathe"", and listen all the way until the finale of ""Eclipse."" ""Music is all about emotions"" as Johnny Cash once put it. ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is an emotionally driven concept album. The concept is simply life. Money, greed, feelings, touching, seeing, hearing, dying, illness, love, hate, destruction....Pink Floyd cover it all right here.\n\n""Breath"" is a relaxing mellow breeze of cool air. ""On the Run"", an instrumental track, sounds like the attempt of someone trying to escape from an asylum. ""Time"" starts off with a 2 minute intro of ticking clocks and Nick Mason clubbing on his drums from time to time. Then it explodes with David Gilmour singing ""Wasting away the moments that make up a dull day"", time slipping away, and at the end of the day, there\'s still no peace and satisfaction. Waters and Gilmour have depressing views of life admittedly. Life is tough, and ""Dark Side of the Moon"" reiterates that. ""Any Colour You Like"" is a funky instrumental track, one of the best instrumental tracks by Pink Floyd. The album finishes very strongly with the delightfully disturbing ""Brain Damage"", with Waters singing like someone truly imprisoned inside of their own mind. Then the grand finale of the album which could serve as a summary of the entire record. The album is pretty short, and ""Speak To Me"" doesn\'t really do much to qualify as a song. ""The Great Gig In the Sky"" is a weak track in my opinion. The entire album all gels together very well, which makes it feel more like one giant song. ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is a classic rock album about everything.']",5.00 stars

This album seems to me to personify the death of the ideals of the 60s at the hand of the oppressive forces that spawned the idealism that lay not only outside of us but within us, but somehow buried in this despair I also sense deep hope for a resurgance and renewal of the forces of life, for as we can see in the forest and its soils, where there is death springs life, and where life once was always comes death. I see such sorrowful ideas and feelings here leading to such sonic and creative beauty. This life and death flow is much what Pink Floyd signifies to me.']",5.00 stars

crowdcontroller,"['Once upon a time I was sitting in a café somewhere in America. One of the sad, lonely and depressing kind where you sit and stare into your coffee cup for ours and all you hear is the sound of your spoon hitting the cup as you whirl it around inside the coffee. Lose yourself in this dark brown swirling water. Why does everybody call coffee black when it\'s really dark brown? It\'s questions like these that drift to my mind in a place like this.\n\nThe sound of another spoon hitting a coffee cup makes me look up. There is a guy sitting in the corner at the other side of the room. And I thought I was the only one here. He looks older than 30 and just as depressed as me. Would be something uniting us I guess.\n\nThen a young girl pushes the door open. And I thought I was the only one here, with my thoughts and my dark brown coffee, I think to myself. She wears a black t-shirt with a prism on it. About ten years ago I would have been happy to see it. I still kind of am though, with all that bad stuff that\'s on the radio. Pink Floyd were once a competitor for my absolute favorite band, now they\'re among the music I like (yes, that is a step down). Though I still really dig a lot of their songs. Anyway, I notice the shirt and start looking down into my coffee cup again.\n\n""You like Pink Floyd?""\n\nI look up again. The guy in the corner has looked up from his coffee and newspaper. The girl looks slightly confused.\n\n""Who?""\n\nI think he just rolled his eyes. ""Pink Floyd. That t-shirt you\'re wearing. That is the album cover of The Dark Side Of The Moon. But that\'s okay. It\'s only the best album ever made.""\n\nShe looks down at the prism, still a little confused. Then her eyes lighten up.\n\n""Oh! Pink Floyd, yes. I... kinda like \'em. This album is really good.""\n\n""Really good?"" He pauses for a second as if there was a hidden meaning in that. ""What else do you like by them?""\n\n""Well, it\'s the only album by them I know. I heard some songs off The Wall though, sounded good as well. So yeah, I like them.""\n\n""You\'re wearing a shirt of a band you only heard one album of and you only like? Why would you do that? It\'s ridiculous.""\n\nShe frowns. ""Why do you think so?""\n\n""Because... Because you\'re not digging deeper into them. You can\'t understand the gigantic innovation and awesomeness of The Dark Side Of The Moon if you can not appreciate the band and know next to nothing about them. Don\'t you think that\'s weird?""\n\nIt takes me a few seconds to realize that he\'s talking to me now. I try looking busy. ""Sorry, what did you say?""\n\nHe rolls his eyes. Seems to be a habit of his. ""You have been listening the whole time. And now I\'m asking you: What do you think? I say: Her wearing a t-shirt of the world\'s greatest band if she does not truly understand and appreciate them is ridiculous.""\n\nI realize there is no way around an argument with him. ""Well, uh, I think she can do whatever she wants.""\n\nHe looks at me as if I just insulted his mother. ""She can do whatever she wants? Well, what kind of music do you listen to?""\n\n""Uhm, I like Pink Floyd. I mainly listen to 70s music. You know, Camel, Fleetwood Mac, Roxy Music, Genesis... But I also like \'modern\' music, if you want to call it that.""\n\n""You like Pink Floyd. Then why don\'t you get my point? She\'s wearing a shirt with the cover of the greatest progressive rock album ever on it, and she only likes it? Like, what is that all about?""\n\nI frown in utter confusion. ""I don\'t get your point. And besides, The Dark Side Of The Moon is barely progressive rock. So calling it the greatest of progressive rock albums is a little far-fetched.""\n\n""Have you even listened to the album? It\'s musical execution is utterly brilliant! Of course it is progressive rock! And it probably has the greatest concept ever!""\n\nI try remembering the album and the last time I really listened to it all the way through. ""Well, there are some good songs on it. And it flows nicely.""\n\n""It... flows nicely?"" I\'m afraid he might faint.\n\n""I guess. But it is not a progressive rock record. You know Genesis, Yes, King Crimson? Those are progressive rock bands. I\'m not saying they made better albums than Pink Floyd, but these bands certainly are more progressive rock than they are. But who cares anyway? If you think The Dark Side Of The Moon is the greatest album ever, than that\'s fine with me. I think it\'s far from that. And if she only likes it, than let her. Shouldn\'t you be glad she enjoys it? What the fuck is your problem?""\n\nI notice at that moment that the girl has left the café while we were discussing the most pointless topic ever to be discussed. Now I\'m the one rolling his eyes. I suddenly wish all I could hear was the spoon inside my coffee cup again.\n\nMy thoughts drifted away once again. I realize the guy is still talking to me.\n\n""...and you\'re telling me it flows nicely! What kind of fucking description is that? What is there not to enjoy about it?""\n\n""Well, I often hear people say they listen to this when they go to sleep. That\'s exactly my main criticism. I think most of the songs are not well executed. Musically, even Pink Floyd themselves have released much better material. And the instrumentals are some of the worst in their catalogue. AND I\'m sick of people telling me that it\'s a concept album. If there is a concept, it\'s either vague and almost non-existent, or I don\'t get it because I\'m German.""\n\nThat makes him laugh. ""You\'re German? Shouldn\'t your favorite Pink Floyd album be The Final Cut then?""\n\nI don\'t get it. ""Why should it be? Well, I think it\'s a better album than The Dark Side Of The Moon but it\'s probably not my favorite. But it\'s just my opinion again. To utter one of the dumbest and yet truest movie quotes ever from Clint Eastwood: Opinions are like assholes; everybody has one.""\n\nHe stops laughing and it looks like his eyeballs are about to pop out of his head. ""What did you say?""\n\n""What do you mean? The quote?""\n\n""You dare to even remotely enjoy The Final Cut, an album that does not have David Gilmour on it?""\n\n""Well, he does play..."", I try to explain to him, but he interrupts me.\n\n""I\'ll report you to my friends commenting on David Gilmour guitar solo videos on Youtube.""\n\nI feel a chill. Now I\'m in deep trouble. Then I hear something behind me. A man walks up to us, he looks really angry.\n\n""I own this establishment, and if you don\'t stop disturbing the other customers with your argument, I\'m going to throw you out.""\n\nI want to explain to him that there are no other customers present, but then I decide to stay silent and not waste the opportunity of bringing this pointless discussion to an end.\n\nThe owner smiles at us. ""And if you\'d like to know: my favorite Pink Floyd album is A Momentary Lapse of Reason.""\n\nI exchange glances with the fanboy. ""Let\'s get out of here"", he says.\n\n\n\n(that didn\'t actually happen. And I don\'t drink coffee.)']",3.50 stars
Ruiner123,"[""A.\n\nSpeak to Me: An entity arises. It speaks to you. It says all these things without saying anything coherently. The sounds, the noises, the screams, the sheer thrill of it all, it speaks to you. When an entity implores you to speak to it, it inadvertently speaks to you. Breathe: An ethereal rush pours from a soul and overlaps onto yours. You're taken away to a distant, yet close land where they only thing that matters is the inner peace one so greatly wants to find. You're obliged to breathe, to remember that you're alive in a terse world. You're told to look around, to remember your very being, the importance of existence, the realization that you're one of many, leading the same torrid path, but take a moment to breathe in the air. On the Run: don't forget how fast the earth moves around you. How the future waits patiently around the corner. The sounds of the past crash with the sounds of the future and before you know it, a yesterday is a distant past, and tomorrow is the now. Crashing footsteps coincide with the evolution of the sounds that make up a hurried world, where faces meet if only for a split second. You find yourself on the run, racing down a deserted path laden with faded images and memories of where you've been and the horrid screams of change, foretelling, foreboding this horridly wonderful future you wish could come soon enough, echoed by a crash to signify a change in the times. Time: a sea of warmth relaxes you and reminds you of the passing hours that come and go. A crash of alarms, of chiming clocks and a frenzied metronome, like a heartbeat, feeding life to a mundane one. A soulful fill of drums, that leads to a reminder to your mundane life, yet filled with the most exciting of trivial happenings. Time will kill us all, but you rejoice in the short hours of happiness; such a happiness blinds the passing of a decade and your soul cries in happiness. Your life flashes before your eyes, but you're to busy looking to the now that you forget the past and the future. A quick reminder to remember to take a breath as you lead this meaningless yet important life that no one can take from you, before the influx of soul comes around again. The Great Gig in the Sky: and it slows down to let you catch up. And one more look around reminds you of the other lost souls that wander the realm along your side, even though your periphery fails to pick up, as your being far monopolizes any semblance of thought. Your soul cries out, and another responds. Then you take the time to realize how beautiful others cry, how they pale in comparison to your selfish, wanton needs, how nothing compares to the moment of realization that life is just not yours, but for everyone to take. You dream of a faraway land where all souls converge to rejoice in the empathy you've created with the rest of the pack that you pray can reach the wretched earth to bring upon the peace it so loudly yearns for. But you find yourself lulled by the chorus itself, failing to realize just how little you've etched in the tapestry of life.\n\nB.\n\nMoney: you are human. You are everything you've been taught to be. You are a piece of the puzzle so gladfully constructed ages ago to make things fair, balanced. Your soul fights the war your mind so blindfully sets aside, as images of greed, sex and coin caress your ever growing soulful promiscuity. A burgeoning attitude overtakes your being, it drives your demons to the fore. The one objective in life becomes the very beast you wished this wretched realm would cast aside, but you can't help but form a devilish grin as tides sway in your favor. Attitude, it brings the very fruit of life, the fruit you wish would rot along with all ill feelings, but the sugar is so sweet and easy to swallow. Oh, and the temptation of sensuality is so hard to pass by, a quick dip in the nothingness of everything means everything in the fleeting moment you long lasts more than the second it exists. A crashing realization of the crime your soul perpetuates with every thought of monetary elevation is justified by the unparalleled greed of your fellow counterpart. Us and Them: remember... you're not alone. In this horrid fight against the injustices of society, other souls cry out for change and comfort and hope you hear their wretched, longing cry. A semblance of a soul trickles down your being again and you realize how unwanted temptations have caused you to stray from this carefully laid-out path. A heavenly chorus descends from the skies, and it touts nothing but peace in all man, careful reminders that your pain is not the only one permeating the earth. Any Colour You Like: just another dip in the ocean of clarity and peace, a faithful remind of where you've been and how you came to be here. Go ahead, take another breath, there's more where that came from. While you're at it, take a moment to perceive the colors of the rainbow that come tumbling down the annals of time and memory and realize everything you missed is worth searching for again come next round. Brain Damage: an introspection leaves you puzzled as you recognize the very existence you so cheerfully ridiculed has become yours. As you try and figure the very moment the jest became about you, you bear the realization that perhaps you've been just as lost as the lost souls. The cacophony of blissful ignorance slowly sweeps away to the part of your mind where you seemingly can't find reason or stability, yet this insane absence of reason is the very root of your mirth. A wry smiles crawls across your facade, and you can see it forming in your comrade too. The loneliness is just a small price to pay for the very peace that exudes from you in waves, drowning all in proximity. Eclipse: dare we say, it eclipses every ill thought and ill memory that’s been created by those who wish nothing but harm upon you, but you've nothing but a smile upon your face as you rest in the cool shadows of a far, distant place where nothing matters but the next wry smiles that dares crawl upon your face. And every passing image and every waking moment is a chance to cry to the world: “I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.”""]",5.00 stars

Isn\'t that how almost all the classics pan out in our individual lives though? When was the last time you played OK Computer? I don\'t know what compelled me so to listen to The Dark Side of the Moon so strongly when I did, but I remember my stepdad being reprimanded at his son\'s baseball game because of me and this album. ""Are you here for the rocket concert?"" some New Hampshire resident said to the milquetoast little pissant he was. I was later told that it was rude to play music this loudly, though I\'ll never understand what it was that I did that\'s any different from just listening to music on some bleachers. What was even weirder was that I didn\'t understand why I liked it. Again, not sure of what compelled me, but it was in the same spot that I ever a. first connected to the internet, b. in general, really got to explore the world of Windows \'95 and Windows \'98 computer gaming, and c. it was also (non sentence-linearly), by extension, the computer room of my grandfather\'s home.\n\nYou know, I haven\'t thought about the first time I heard The Dark Side of the Moon in... well, since it happened. Early early 2006, didn\'t even have aforementioned iPod yet; I didn\'t know why I didn\'t like it yet, but I knew I\'d have to someday. Today\'s that day. I know I\'ve been digesting this for the entirety of what I\'ve known music as in all this time, but holy fucking smokes, is there any record that has more timelessness out of the genuineness of that word? Timeless. What does that mean? It means that time doesn\'t apply to it. May 26th, 2006. It means what it did on March 24th, 1973 as exactly it did on September 15th, 2014. Or again in 2020 when revising or editing a draft of this review. It was there ten days after my grandma would die, but eight years early. It was released 21 years before my birth, though take away five days and return that thousandth two to a shiny three. We haven\'t even said a word on the music yet and that\'s something I promised I wouldn\'t do if I replaced my original words.\n\nThe music. The reason that it is hard to say anything is that a lot has been said. But it is a new courage when one tries to do it again, or to bring new perspective to just the music. This is why I\'ve been such a strange reviewer around these parts. This is the album that taught me everything, everything I know on interpretation of lyrics and of concepts that run through the thematic cosmos that we\'re all living. It\'s the only thing I know of that delivers itself so doublemindedly that the cynic can love it as much as the archangel. No one told you when to run and you missed the starting gun? I always took ""Time"" to be a stark warning away from seeking enlightenment, and even in the face of Alan Watts and Syd Barrett and the 1960s/1970s psychedelia that midwived such a special CD, I do this. I say, ""No. Even enlightenment has the parasite of fear attached to the words it says as soon as it departs."" It means just as much encouragement if you want it to be. You don\'t remember the very beginning of your life, yet you found your way here. We\'re always in some sort of a rebirth, but it\'s trying to witness its semantic structure that causes us to just stretch its relevance infinitely. Calm down, listen to music, go to sleep, do all of the above or go sync something you like up to a timeless movie.\n\nMy grandmother loved ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow."" In 2004, I learned how to play it on clarinet with an engraved VITO clarinet, something I\'d happened upon by accident and without geographic awareness. That was the last year of what I consider to be the first act of life, the incognizant act where all was decided and it felt like there wasn\'t even a dotted line to show me where the fulcrum should be. I am back, I am not going anywhere, and it feels so good to see that right here with The Dark Side of the Moon playing. I\'m not here to review every thought on an album, but to let the transience of it speak to me as I see fit. This is why I started my music career on this absolutely paradigm-throttling release, of my world and of 1973\'s allure.\n\n""Us and Them"" is on right now and it\'s about the fact that you\'re sending out an army of yourself to do your bidding. Literally. This is how spacetime works. It goes round and round until you\'ve narrowed yourself down and tricked through trial-and-error. You do this to nobody but you, and it is why spontaneity and ruthlessness better a person regardless of morality. This whole album is trying to tell you this: you are not damaged, you are not sleeping. The idea of waking up is all about the fact that you\'ve had your eyes/I\'s open since halfway through the tumultuousness. Now, it\'s looking up. Why do you think everything in the news and the sky corresponds to what you\'re sensing and a part of? The darkest side of the moon is not understanding that it\'s the power within the moon that gives it what it is.\n\nEvery single thing in existence is about the trinity of pineal third eye, the brain, and the heart. It has clicked. This is what it has all been about. An album cleverly in ode to the DMT experience if only slightly, but in sync with a million dozen aspects of our world. A quest of mind and body and soul, it is literally the most cliche thing of all-time and I commit to it with bells on. I begin here. Watch as the consensus of the world changes and the ultimate view of mankind does the unthinkable: it makes this everybody\'s new favorite album.

Most of the albums they made before this were mostly good, but lacked the cohesiveness and were too experimental to draw in a pop audience. That all changed with DSOTM. A lot of the thanks can be attributed to sound engineer Alan Parsons, who does a masterful job helping the band realize their full potential. Each of the songs here are meshed into thrilling soundscapes that capture the imagination so vividly. The album starts off slow, with ""Speak To Me"", which flows right into the mellowed out ""Breathe"". ""On The Run"" is a mix that takes full advantage of early day stereo. The album really starts to hit it\'s stride with the awe inspiring, ""Time"". The song displays the singers realization on how much time is squandered on striving for material possessions. ""The Great Gig In The Sky"" is a wordless piece, belted out by then session singer, Claire Tory. Let\'s just say it will leave you with goosebumps. Next, is the surprising hit single from the album, ""Money"", which ironically, is about the rejection of greedy, corporate ""fat cats"", and Roger Waters\' socialistic views on the subject. The song then fades into the hauntingly eire, ""Us And Them"". The track is the centerpiece of album that conveys the then prevalent issues of both war and poverty. The song goes seamlessly into ""Any Colour You Like"", which is followed by the paranoid lyricism of ""Brain Damage"". The album is then brought to a climatic end with the ravaging ""Eclipse"".

Veff,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""LT 1 To get a few things out of the way first, Pink Floyd are great songwriters, there is no doubt about it. They really know how to build a song with very powerful dynamics out of a few otherwise simple elements. They also know very well what to do with the instruments that stay in the background, meaning that if the moment's appropriate for some noodling, they noodle, and if the moment's appropriate to create atmosphere, they do that instead. They are also beasts what comes to writing a memorable solo. And their production is always top-notch. All in all, even if they might come off as a bit boring from time to time, they never really make anything that is outright bad, and their output is largely positive. All of the tracks on The Dark Side of the Moon, on their own, at least, work fine. Pink Floyd's real trouble is with the bigger picture, with the way their tracks work with each other, or don't, as constituents of a whole, that is, the album they're in, with how they work, or not, off of the momentum provided by what preceded them, and with how all this reflects on the overall musical narrative.\n\nThe first side is a mess. 'Breathe' barely picks up enough speed to sustain itself, let alone to open The Dark Side of The Moon single-handedly. And that's fine, no biggie, there's no problem with that as long as the track immediately after it doesn't stall the album, draining it of all the little momentum it might have built up until then, which is exactly what 'On the Run' does. There might be some weird symbolism going on there, I don't know, I'm terrible at deciphering that sort of thing, at most what I get about the placement of 'On the Run' straight at the beginning of the album is that it's representative of the way society, and capitalism in particular, has blinded us to the art of placing a track of keyboard doodling in an appropriate spot on an album, and how that reflected on British society in the 70s, and consequently on Pink Floyd themselves, who are absolutely terrible at the above mentioned artform. Once 'On the Run' has, and I really don't want to say this, guys, I'd phrase it some other way if I could think of one, but once 'On the Run' has run its course, I'm so sorry, once 'On the Run' has run its course you'd think that we'd have had enough of the stalling and could go on with the actual album for once, and Pink Floyd obviously thought likewise, given that 'Time' is one of the more in-your-face moments on here, but before we can get to that we need to briefly stay in a clock collector's cabin as the time strikes midday, just because Pink Floyd felt like it was necessary. I guess that they might have wanted to reflect on the listener the 'quiet desperation' they mention further on in the track by playing hard to get, but I generally prefer to listen to music because I like it, and not because I want to be the butt of some musicians' joke. The rest of track, though, I have no problems with it, it's quite a relief, in fact, it basically joins all the good things Pink Floyd are at that I mentioned previously. Not to discredit the other tracks here, mind you, they're also very good on their own, I just give special attention to 'Time' because it also may very well be the most perfect example of Pink Floyd's famous sound.\n\nI'm not done bashing the first side yet, because we still have another track to go, 'The Great Gig in the Sky'. Now, this one used to be one of my favorites off of Dark Side of the Moon back when I was properly into Pink Floyd, and, truth be told, it is a really good track, or at least it's memorable and powerful thanks to the impressive vocal performance, albeit not all that catchy, kind of like some of the longer Autechre numbers like 'Irlite (get 0)'. As such it would have been a great way to cap off the album, or lead up to the big wrap-up, and at the same time that's all that this type of track is truly good at, at ending things with a bang. And that's why it sounds so jarring as the fifth track on the album. Sure, one could argue that it's meant to close the first side a high note, but remember that because of the whole ordeal with 'On the Run' the album essentially only started a track ago, is this really all there is to it? As it stands, this one just comes off as obnoxious, the album's been nuked before anything of interest's even happened (with an error of one thing of interest). Okay, if there's one thing I have to really esteem Pink Floyd for, it's for somehow saving the album somewhat after the one two punch of tracks 3 and 5. It's been a bumpy road so far, and with 'The Great Gig in the Sky' we're mid air from having veered off the road and straight into a fucking cliff, so the way that 'Money's groove picks up the slack, not so much as if those bad things were all behind us now, but as if they'd never happened to begin with, is like if we'd managed to land on the 6 foot wide half-pipe at bottom of the cliff with a light scratch on the bumper. That is amazing.\n\n'Money' promises to be the best song here, and it really could have been, but it gets too worked up over its own success, to the point that when it breaks into interpretative dance during the solo it loses track of where it was going or what it planned to do next and deflates until one's left to wonder what all the fuss was about to begin with. In a way that move actually worked in the album's favour, as it turned out to be the perfect setup for the centerpiece of Dark Side of The Moon, 'Us and Them'. I won't discuss this one too much in depth other than mentioning the awesome way the verse builds up towards the chorus, almost all on the back of a single dissonant chord on the organ that comes in and out. That is truly inspiring stuff, unlike that sentence. After such a strong note I guess it makes sense for the album to sort of lose track and go into this limbo of lack of direction that it does. 'Any Colour you Like' feeds off of whatever secondhand momentum it could have gotten off of the chill vibes of its predecessor, and it makes good use of themes from 'Breathe', and there's a really neat solo and chord change in it too. I don't know if I like this track, though, I understand that it's a suitable approach to the problem of keeping the album going in the afterglow of it's strongest song by far, and I don't know if there were any other options available to Pink Floyd, really, except maybe putting track 5 here instead and calling it a day, but I always thought that 'Any Colour You Like' feels kind of lost, like it's a track doomed to failure, and no matter how much effort is put into it, it will always either feel unrealized or out of place. I can appreciate, nevertheless, how it keeps things going along fairly smoothly against all odds, and is a pretty neat transition into the very end of the album. I'm not going to address 'Brain Damage' and 'Eclipse' solely because this synopsis is becoming so long it's not even funny any more. But basically, 'Brain Damage' is alright except its production is a bit off, too spacious for the mood of the song, and 'Eclipse' is a very nice way to end the album indeed.\n\nUltimately, I think that given the amount of good material there is here, this is one of the most disappointing albums I have ever heard in my life, and that's almost solely because of some really bad song placements. That's all I really wanted to say. That's my conclusion. I am pretty sure that by experimenting with the cutting room a bit, Pink Floyd could have milked out at least an extra star out of me for this one, but then again I understand perfectly well if they can't be assed to do such a thing. I mean, for one, they're disbanded, and possibly not all of them are alive by now, and for another one many people like the album as is, and they seem to like it very much, I'm not trying to indoctrinate anyone here, I'm just trying to rationalize my, not so much dislike, but indifference for this album, and see what others see in it. And that, I think I've done well enough by now.\n\nAlso, there's one other thing, the whole album theme introduced in 'Breathe'. I guess it's a nice idea, but for now Pink Floyd have executed it somewhat poorly, in a way they seem to have slapped it in whenever they didn't know what else to do. Really, a problem I have with this album, I guess, is also the way it seems to try to introduce new ideas and keep some sort of atmosphere during the first side, but then none of that stays in the second one. It all just feels like a testing ground for ideas that haven't yet come into fruition, and I guess I can respect that, but I can't really enjoy that sort of thing as an actual album."", '']",3.00 stars
AddictionAddict,"['Improving on what was already one of the greatest albums of all-time, this release of The Dark Side of the Moon includes a second disc with a 1974 live performance of the album in its entirety. Is that performance perfect in every way? No, but it\'s damn good nonetheless. The extended live versions of ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" & ""Any Colour You Like"" are both especially pleasing to this reviewer\'s ears.\n\nI\'m not even going to try to get into a track-by-track rating of DSotM - it doesn\'t seem appropriate to me for an album like this.

As such, track ratings don\'t do the album justice.']",5.00 stars
Shniks,"['1973\n\nJe savais que ça devait arriver. Je le sentais venir le Dark Side of the Moon premier des charts en 73, avec son air plein de suffisance, son statut d’intouchable. Cet album m’énerve au plus au point. Ou plutôt son statut, son soi-disant aspect révolutionnaire, ce prisme, devenu symbole du groupe alors que bordel, le meilleur des Pink Floyd c’est loin d’être ça. The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, ça c’était révolutionnaire !\n\nPourtant ça part pas trop mal avec Speak to me/Breathe, plein de volupté. J’ai l’impression d’être à Hawaï, de m’évader, de respirer. Merci Pink Floyd. Bon, bien sur, il y a le chant de Gilmour, qui peut vite s’avérer être insupportable. Mais en l’occurrence, cette perpétuelle langueur qui semble l’habiter sied parfaitement à la paisible atmosphère du morceau. Mais voilà, le problème de Dark Side of the Moon, ce sont les morceaux comme On the Run (j\'entends par là les pseudos ""expérimentations""). Vous avez beau faire passer ça pour une représentation angoissante de la mort et de la crainte qu’il en émane ou je ne sais quoi, ce morceau n’est rien d’autre qu’une simple arnaque, succession de notes sans substance au synthé, agrémentée de sons rappelant l’envol puis le crash d’un avion, ouah. Il y a vraiment des gens qui s’extasient devant ça ? Puis vient Time. J’aime bien Time. Je ne lui reconnais certainement pas ce statut de chef d’œuvre qu’on lui accorde inexorablement, mais je l’aime bien. La guitare fuzzy de Gilmour, les douces harmonies de Wright, les cœurs parfaitement retravaillés au convertisseur vocal, puis le retour à… Breathe, après le second couplet. Arrive le moment gênant. C’est vrai, je ne sais jamais où me mettre lorsque j’entends The Great Gig in the Sky. J’ai toujours peur de croiser le regard d\'un fan, et que cette personne me sorte un « c’est génial hein, toute cette émotion… » plein de théâtralité. Parce que bon Clare Torry, bah… Elle chante juste. Mais c’est tout. Pour un morceau censé laisser transparaître une émotion bouleversante, mêlant désespoir et abandon face à la mort, c’est quand même limite. Vous imaginez une Elizabeth Fraser à la place… Puis vient Money. Dire que cette chanson a atteint le Top 20 des charts américains. Composée par Roger Waters, la chanson est sujette à une intro insupportable de bruits d’argent (...), suivie par une jam qui offre quelques moments guitare/bass bien sympathiques, agrémentés d’un saxo peu mémorable, il faut bien se l\'avouer. Le morceau souffre bien évidemment d’une longueur totalement injustifiée, ayant largement pu se terminer après l’improvisation instrumentale, plutôt que de revenir sur ce ""MONEEY"" agressant. Us and Them me pose quant à elle un sérieux problème. Tout est en effet réuni pour me plaire, un quatuor en pleine symbiose, accompagné par le saxo de Dick Parry intelligemment mis en retrait, des harmonies vocales touchantes, tout quoi. Mais seulement voilà, cette grandiloquence qui semble presque pathologique chez le Floyd post-Syd Barrett me crée un malaise. Il y a quelque chose de pompeux derrière tout ce florilège d’élaborations musicales complexes. Et je ne dis pas ça parce que je n’aime pas le prog. J’aime beaucoup King Crimson par exemple, qui, bien que dans un registre différent, parvient par je ne sais quel miracle à littéralement nous transporter plutôt que de se contenter d’une stérile mise en émoi. Any Colour You Like est encore une fois très mal exploitée. Les sonorités des guitare et clavier sont intéressantes, et offrent une réelle nouveauté pour l’époque, mais mélodiquement c’est pauvre, sans réel effort de structure. On reste dans l’esprit jam, une jam qui s’éternise sans savoir vraiment où aller. Heureusement, Brain Damage, à travers laquelle on ressent la présence de Syd (les paroles, écrites par Waters lui sont dédiées) apporte un souffle nouveau dans cet album qui ne voit pas le bout. L’aspect épique du morceau rend l’ensemble bouleversant, mettant l’ex-chanteur du groupe dans l’ombre du coté obscur de la Lune. Cette poignante déchirure se retrouve malheureusement vidée de sens lorsque surgit ce Eclipse regorgeant de cette envahissante grandiloquence.\n\nMeilleur album de l’année : For Your Pleasure de Roxy Music.\n\nNote : 4,5/10']",2.50 stars
chemicalsunshine,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Ok this is my first genuine review of material that I have ever done for music, and so I’ve chosen the topic to be the Celebrated Pink Floyd landmark DSOTM, considered by many to be a masterpiece of rock and roll and contemporary pop culture. The album spent a total of 740 weeks on the top 500 hundred album charts which totaled for a record breaking 15 years, and has sold over 50 million records since its release almost forty years ago, that is to say that for every album sold is equivalent to the total population of Canada and over. Upon its release the album made the band an international super star in Rock circles and led them out of being seeing as a psychedelic space rock from the 60s.\n\nThe album is the quintessential concept album dealing with matters of the human condition interlinked with themes of war, death, age, greed, modern life and insanity – all of which plays as one continual piece with each song segmenting into one another acting as a story about modern existence in the late 20th century . It’s because of this, that the album is still able to resonate with listeners today, and act as a musical novel with issues that are timeless and encapsulate the existential frailties of our limited physical existence and the hope found in our peaceful acceptance.\n\n\n\nIt’s for this, that it is the most overrated piece of crap found in popular culture\n\n\n\nSorry, I don’t mean to burst a bubble or heretically supposition that this is a turkey, it’s not, and in fact it is genuinely good work with amazing compositions. The songs, the production, the musicianship, the themes and the lyrics (well…mostly) are all extraordinary outstanding for the decade they were crafted in, and represented a level of depth in technical production that would change the modern pop music scene forever. Listening to some of the songs you cannot help but feel they could have easily been composed just last year, and nothing in their context and meaning has changed for teenagers in 1973 to teenagers of 2012, the problem is that… it’s just to full of itself\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the subject matters shall we – as has been previously stated and reiterated DSOTM deals with weighty subject matters such as War, Age, Material Vanity, Madness and Death, not something you’re going to want to listen at a party, and to further aggravate the situation the music’s general lack of pop convention with odd time signatures, and emphasis on Jazz progression then blues scales, means its more in line too Beethoven and Mozart and intellectual pretentiousness, then Chuck Berry reckless youthful abandonment to what Rock & Roll generally stood for. It’s an album conceited on the idea of weighty themes and trying to hold value as something meaningful and deep, that it becomes a tempestuous burden and an emotionally antiseptic for the listener. As a result Dark Side suffers from something that is egregious and symptomatic to Artist with agendas that they cannot to back up without emotional involvement, it might be a masterpiece but it is an INAUTHENTIC masterpiece operating by calculated emotional affect of preprogrammed poignancy and timed sentiment, everything is constructed perfectly without the emotional involvement of the musicians, as a result there is no urgency or organic relationship which makes this an involving piece, it’s this lack of authenticity that derives the failings of the albums music, all the ingredients are there to make this a wonderful album but without the personal touches of emotional involvement, the soufflé rises but its taste is\n\n\n\nAnd here in lies the problem, and the reason why I undertook this to be the first album to review, because this is the top album most people consider the one you listen to before you die, and you should, it is important, on the whole while the album is great for its ensemble, but that in lies the problem – Individually the songs are not strong. Some are great, some are good and some exist to full fill the premise that this album is an event of a singular identity,\n\n\n\nAs such I feel it Is my duty to review each song on their own to view them as units worth to measure the criterion of Greatness\n\n\n\nSpeak to Me – the opening song, and the prologue of the album, I say a prologue because it’s just sound bites of voice over from the rest of the album centering on a pulse which is supposed to represent the beats of life or some other shit. Either way this piece is just an excuse to add a minute and add to the mythology that what you’re listening to is art from a louver instead of Standard Norman Rockwell. It might add to the concept but in my ears it’s just clever filler.\n\n\n\nBreath – ahhh yes Breath, the song which brings in the sonic textures of celestial cadence of David Gilmour’s fender Stratocaster and Rick Wrights Nebulous Farsi organ to the listeners ear. When you listen to this you understand why Floyd where amazing for transcending the ephemeral bounds of material reality with spacious mechanics, which is simultaneously the reason why they’re still considered stoner music. I will say that if I was a kid with earphones and a stash of weed the opening bars of this song would be the quite essential baked heaven, but since I am not a pot head, I can’t say this does anything but give me the feeling of being queasy on a beach. The lyrics were probably written by someone who was stoned, and come out as deep as a pretentious 16 year old kid at high school poetry contest who thinks their wise beyond their years.\n\n“Breath, Breath in the air\n\ndon’t be afraid to care”\n\n“All you touch and all you see, is all your life will ever be”\n\nWow Roger!!! I never felt so in touch with the banality of common life in the way that you’re too bit attempt and portraying meaningful significances comes off as cheesy and third rate. If you were to use this as this man’s gift for lyricism you’d have be baffled, frankly Gilmour should have looked over this after Uncle Roger left to give himself more faith in his own abilities as a writer. Musically its average and suppose to be deep, but like I said about this albums problem is to INAUTHETIC to be truly considered unique, and while the music is fun, lack of soul ensures it’s not quality.\n\n\n\nOn the Run – More like “fuck me with Syphilis and impregnate me with the twin sisters of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia”, without a doubt the most annoying instrumental piece and also the most dated composition to come out of the album. This always shatters my belief in its greatness and the one that reduces me to looking at my watch to see when it is over. The “music” is just a pathetic excuse to use modern technology in the studio with the EMS Synthi At added to the effect. I’m all for innovation and if it’s one thing Dark Side is its Innovative, but if you decide to record a song that samples the same8- note sequence riff for ten seconds at different speeds and play it for THREE FUCKING MINUTES!, then your idea of innovation is an arbitrary excuse to design filler and place it under the medium of art, sometimes you can get away with this, but this is the time you can’t. To think this is the best song off the album is like mentioning your favorite member of Al Quida. I dare you to listen to this song with the pretty blond girl who works at assistance, try explaining how this all about “the hectic pursuit of middle class archetypes and the chase of a scheduled existence” as is the bullshit by the band then watch how that cute girl gives you a look which will undoubtedly say she’s “on the run”, this is very rare but sometimes women do have good taste in music. Utter CRAP!\n\n\n\nTime – Finally! The first bloody good song on this thing and which can easily be taken as a piece on its own as founded in its overplayed and overhyped by your local FM radio station. Mind you this at least deserves its reputation for being a good song, and the point where the music and lyrics congeal to actually taking off and being a fun ride, or at least a philosophical ride if it weren’t for Waters pessimism getting in the way.\n\n\n\n“Then one day you find, ten years have gone behind, you missed the starting gun”\n\nNow I understand why this man is revered for being good witted and also manic depressing. Time begins with wonderful banter between the four band members with both the drumming and guitar work being the highlights, when the song kicks in with the first lyrics this becomes Gilmour’s show, and boy does Papa David rock like an angry wizard with those solos, he is also able to convey the sense of hopelessness that happens to someone who has forgotten how to live their life to the best pursuit of their abilities. Unlike any other guitar player Gilmour is able to make his guitar sound like a person and not as a musical instrument, this is found in the upscale in the middle section, where each note is played with desperation and despair. For the first time the music and lyrics are not to overburdened to be something of an embarrassment and actually have true important meaning. I’m not going to bother with Breath (Reprise) because that just neatly falls in this song. First signs of real brilliance\n\n\n\nGreat Gig in the Sky – Compelling and intimate are the best words to describe this piece about the voyage into the undiscovered country. Although the album begins to a shaky start, it can be said that it ends on an amazing closing, (at least on side A).Built on a simple minor chord progression, Rick Wright builds emotional texture that resonates the experience of dying or being with someone who is passing, it’s quite then a burst of vocals comes in and the other musicians come in from behind, The vocals that Clair Tory delivers are desperate and filled with passion, instead of singing she utilizes her vocals as an instrument delivering a heart wrenching pleading for life as death slowly consumes her energy. Then as her voice dies, Uncle Richard plays the same progression, before hitting the last key that fades into the outer reaches of oblivion. If the band were looking for emotion they found it here, a true work of art.\n\n\n\nMoney – the Rocker and the one that essentially took Pink Floyd from relative obscurity into American Heavyweights on FM. While the songs is satirical condemnation of the greed of capitalist system, it’s the one that is almost always played as a celebration for the depraved and gaudy, know wonder Americans love it they don’t understand the concept of irony. Personally I have mixed feelings about this song, on the one hand it is a remarkable composition and actually is better than the first three pieces of side A, on the other it made mega stars out of a band condemning greed and the infatuation of blind materialism. How can there be reconciliation for people, who mock a lifestyle they feel lacks substance and then proceed to buy mansions and yachts in the Caribbean, say what you like about Gangster rap, at least their honest about wanting material possessions, as opposed to left wing hypocrites billed as speaking for the people. The instrumental section featuring Dick Perry on Saxophone is what gives the song its kick and also as famously engrained as the one to “shake your ass too”, and you can, with a memorable opening bass riff, and stellar solos and lyrics this is one the hot girls can get drunk too and throw bras on the stage. But because the band got famous to this while critizing the lifestyle it just seems, ugly.\n\n\n\nUs and Them – Its sad that Rick Wrights contributions pretty much evaporated after this album, because the two essential good songs, were in part written by him, and his amazing depth of layering space in his keyboard and piano work provided the ground work of soul and humanity that Waters misanthropic obsession and his dead father could allow us to listen to without feeling spitted on. Dick Perry returns again for another Saxophone, as it follows the ethereal progression of Wrights Farsi, Pink Floyd aren’t known for Ballads but there is something about the first minutes of this song that makes me want to take the next girl that I see and dance around for the next seven minutes. Again the lyrics are’nt one hundred percent geniuses as some people would have you believe but, The vocals by Papa David and Mr. Wright add to the resonate of emotion pleading for the acceptance of differences and the end of bipartisan conflicts and the search for peace. A truly stellar song that segues into moderately good instrumental\n\n\n\nAny Color you Like – Every song on Dark side is remembered by the majority of people, all accept for this one, which is almost always the one that is lease listened to as an individual. Why this occurs I do not know, granted the synth work and guitar work resonate with a very 70s feel, but this is still the best instrumental on the album, even On the Run, which for the life of me I still do not understand why is more popular. This song is dynamic and moving and has all the things you expect from Papa David’s spirited playing, which is both jovial and simultaneously melancholic, Mason and Wright offer great counterpoint and act as an amazing trio. Of course being that it’s this three that lack the idea of doing concepts it’s understandable why this piece seems to have nothing to offer about what Dark side is about, it doesn’t matter because it’s nice. It’s a shame this would be the last song recorded without Waters in put, because after that it essentially became his show.\n\n\n\nBrain Damage/Eclipse - because these songs so easily segue into one another, and because they’re both Written by Waters I’m not going to bother and separate them and instead see them as one entity. As a closing it works wonderfully uniting the entire album together and aspiring the ambitious themes set, it’s also the best one to sing to in terms of a sing along factor to it, although since the subject begins with madness and then enlightenment I doubts it’s the one mostly sung. Musically it’s lackluster and the point that I drive home that this lacks soul, although the production is amazing and lifts it to near perfection. The one thing that is forgotten is how Alan Parsons was able to make this a united piece and make it work. If Floyd were the writer Parson was the editor needed to make this project work, and it is to him that their fame is owed to. As the song ends the album ends, with one left feeling excited and mesmerized, it’s just a pity it takes itself too seriously.\n\n\n\nOn the whole Dark side is amazing, but as the sum of its parts it lacks substance or emotional resolution that the album is searching for. The stalwarts of the album are Time (breath reprise) Gig in the Sky, Money and Us and Them Brain damage and eclipse, but the others are essentially forgettable, and without them being connected to the album would have no meaning or identity outside of being listened to. Furthermore the obsession to make this album have depth of philosophical lamentations on the meaning of existence and the choices in life come off as sanctimonious proselytizing and without soul like a Hollywood movie during the Christmas month. Everyone was so obsessed with trying to make an Oscar, they forgot you need a soul, and although Dark side is great in many ways, the one thing that it truly lacks is the one thing that gives art true definition. Soul\n\nFinal Rating: B']",4.00 stars

Jackalynn,"[""Ogni volta che mi ritrovo a parlare, o pensare, a questo disco, sono fortemente combattuto.\n\nDa un lato è forse il disco più abusato di tutta la storia del rock: almeno qui in Italia, gente che in vita sua avrà ascoltato sì e no 50 artisti lo considera il Sublime wagneriano, il punto di non ritorno dello sperimentalismo rock, e lo usa per spiegare il divorzio e l'alopecia, la Formula Uno e il totalitarismo.\nDall'altra, è sicuramente il disco più omogeneo e di gruppo mai pubblicato dai Pink Floyd, che lavorano a otto mani su quella che è più o meno una suite lunga due facciate sul tema dell'alienazione umana e delle sue cause (la banalità del quotidiano, la paura della morte, l'impietoso scorrere del tempo e il modo in cui ciononostante lo si spreca a tonnellate, il consumismo, l'isolamento di alcune fasce sociali, la mancanza di possibilità di scelta, la pura e semplice follia). Ognuno fa la sua parte: Waters è la mente, lo sviluppatore dei testi e della cornice tematica, che Gilmour e Wright immergono in sonorità e melodie praticamente perfette, mentre Mason dà sfoggi di inventiva ed energia percussiva come mai più gli riuscirà.\n\nDa una parte ci si spertica in chilometriche, pretenziose e inopportune lodi, dall'altra lo si bistratta spesso per puro istinto iconoclasta (e diciamocelo, nel 2014 è assolutamente ridicolo; come ebbe a dire Mark E. Smith il punk è stato lì per 10 cazzo di minuti, e le icone da distruggere al giorno d'oggi sono ben altre e più recenti).\n\nDa una parte ha creato una pericolosa idea di vuoto perfezionismo da studio di registrazione, i cui cultori forse li conoscete col nomignolo di riccardoni. Dall'altra, gruppi infinitamente più validi porteranno a frutto la lezione in maniera intelligente ed efficace: non è poi spararla grossa dicendo che OK Computer è il DSOTM dei 90s.\n\nSopravvalutato?

UMUR,"['""Dark Side of the Moon"" is the 8th full-length studio album by UK progressive rock act Pink Floyd. The album was released through Harvest/EMI in March 1973. This was the release that lifted Pink Floyd from a successful act that mainly had a following in Europe to international stardom. ""Dark Side of the Moon"" remains to this day the best selling album in the group´s discography with an estimated sale of over 40 million copies. We´re talking an album in the top 10 of the all time best selling albums in the history of popular music. The album is a concept piece with the main theme: ""Things that make people mad"". The theme was suggested by bassist Roger Waters and the other members of the group were hooked on the idea.\n\nThe music on ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is varied and incorporates several new elements that haven´t been heard on earlier releases by Pink Floyd. Lots of studio tricks, female backing and lead vocals, and dominant sections with saxophone soloing are some of the new features on the album. We´re of course also treated with the trademark mellow vocals, but also more rocking rough ditto which is great for the variation on the album. There are 10 tracks on the album (some CD releases merge the first two tracks ""Speak To Me"" and ""Breathe"" into one track thus making the album a 9 track release). All tracks seque into each other either by short sound effect interludes or they simply sound like parts of one longer track which for example is the case with ""Us And Them"" and ""Any Colour You Like"". Tracks like ""Breathe"", ""Time"" and ""Brain Damage"" have always been highlightsto my ears but it´s tracks like the experimental instrumental ""On the Run"" with it´ss extensive use of studio tricks and the female led ""The Great Gig In the Sky"" that stand out as being vastly different from anything else Pink Floyd had released up until then.\n\nThere is a notable increase in the use of synths on ""Dark Side of the Moon"" compared to earlier releases which is also a feaure that provides the album a fresh and occasionally almost futuristic sound. David Gilmour´s guitar soloes on the album also deserve a mention as they are quite frankly fantastic. Packed full with emotion. Quite a few guitarists out there could learn a lot from David Gilmour. Putting equal amounts of great emotion into each note can sometimes be much harder that playing faster than the speed of lightning, and that´s exactly what he does. Each note he plays are given just the right bend, which gives his playing a lot more impact than more ""clinical"" players.\n\nThe production on the album is outstanding. The sound provides the album with a timeless quality that doesn´t imediately give away the fact that this album was recorded and released in 1972-1973 (the recording sessions for the album began in June 1972). A great audio achivement.\n\n""Dark Side of the Moon"" is a classic progressive rock album and it´s no wonder it is such a popular album. The sound production is gorgeous, the musicianship excellent and the songwriting intriguing and varied. It´s the timeless quality of the material that´s probably the album´s greatest asset though and probably the main reason why, it keeps enchanting new generations of rock listeners again and again. The fact that the band seamlessly combine mainstream oriented pop/rock elements with progressive rock is another asset. It´s not something a lot of artists have done with success. A 4.5 star (90%) rating is deserved.', 'http://www.progarchives.com/Review.asp?id=239365']",4.50 stars
siLLy_puPPy,"[""Did you know that a blues rock group named Medicine Head released an album in 1972 with the same exact title? Because of this Pink Floyd briefly changed the name of this album to Eclipse. The Medicine Head album turned out to be a commercial flop so they decided to keep the title after all. I'm glad they did cuz it has a better ring to it :-P\n\nDid the planets ever align perfectly for PINK FLOYD in 1973. This masterpiece delivered the perfect mix of ideas that the band had explored over the years making this an almost unanimously loved album by possibly the widest spectrum of music lovers on the planet. The music is accessible enough for anyone to understand and yet complex enough to satisfy even hardened proggers and that means that this album even today is a kind of coming of age album where kids of all ages are still blown away by its inventiveness. I have always seen this album as the perfect gateway into the greater prog universe.\n\nDARK SIDE is so successful that it is the 2nd best selling album of all time. It remained on the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988 with an estimated 50 million copies sold! Countless lawsuits have been filed claiming creative collaborations with this enterprise and some have been successful but that soap opera is far removed from the music itself.\n\nAfter years of what the group has called “psychedelic noodling” on their previous albums they decided upon a concept with a unified theme. Syd Barrett may have only been in the group long enough to record one album before he basically lost his mind yet he provided inspiration in the form of mental illness while other themes include conflict, greed and paranoia.\n\nDARK SIDE is both reflective and cutting edge. PINK FLOYD utilized the most advanced technology of the time and incorporated metronomic sound effects, tape loops, cross-fades of elements from other parts of the album, backward piano playing and 7-beat effects loop just to name a few. Despite all this hi-tech innovation the album has a warm soulful side. Richard Wright and David Gilmour proved their abilities to harmonize and the soulful studio diva Clare Torry delivered some of the most brilliant wordless vocalizations ever laid down on tape. And if that wasn't enough the music transitions from track to track in one stream of consciousness never breaking the spell until throughout its entirety.\n\nMy absolute favorite way i've ever heard this album is when I saw it accompanied by a laserlight show on an astronomy dome. Very appropriate don't ya think?\n\no\no o\no o\no o\no o\no x x x x x x x\nx x x x x x x x\nx o x x x x x x\nx o x x x x x\nx o o x x x\nx o o x x\nx o o x\no o\no o\no o\no o\no o\no o\no o\nPINK FLOYD - THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON – 5 starssssssssssssss""]",5.00 stars

friso,"[""On Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' album the band is seriously turning down the psychedelics an drugged out progressive epics. In stead, the band focused on a mature song-writing style and a top-notch production quality, which still stands as one of the best ever. I'm quite amazed about how different this band sounds from the 'Live at Pompeii' recordings made right before this album was recorded. To me that live DVD shows Pink Floyd at its progressive zenith (together with the Atom Heart Mother suite), whereas 'Dark Side of the Moon' feels more like an iconic record for all kind of sentimental purposes that don't mean much to me. In fact, I think the first side of the record is rather slow-paced and even boring. A song like 'The Great Gig in the Sky' doesn't even sound like an effort by this band. The very 'adult' sound to me seems a bit lackluster. Furthermore, much of the choir arrangements, songwriting and use of the saxophone is clearly copied from Graham Nash's debut album of the year before. On side two I can appreciate the bluesy 'Money' and the melancholy song 'Us and Them', but then again; these are no favorites of mine. In the end, I find liking 'Dark Side of the Moon' rather difficult - not for the least because it somehow feels like its expected of me. Given the choice, I would rather have - taken at random - an odd record like Vangelis's 'Hypothesis' than this one. Or Graham Nash's debut for that matter.""]",3.50 stars

Then one of the two brilliant tracks, Breathe (in the air) begins, with Rodger sounding like his former bandmate Syd (on drugs) and talking about rabbits digging holes.

Pink Floyd may have been there and then set it to music perfectly.\nGreat. But did I ever want to witness that there\'s nothing going on there ? No, not really. I wouldn\'t wanna go there for a million dollars\' worth of Money.\nIf I hadn\'t known by then I sure made that decision by listening to this album quite a several times.\n\nI hoped it would grow.\nI waited for the moment in which that certain ""click""\nwould happen and I can join the pleasure.\nInstead of that moment arriving - it got worse.\nI started to suffer and I don\'t like to suffer.\nThe Waiting, which, according to Tom Petty,\nis ""the hardest part"", is hard enough.\nTom Petty, btw, is a real good songwriter.\nUnfortunately he\'s never been a member of Pink Floyd.\nAnd he\'s got enough of Money to never be...\nah, let\'s cut this tragedy short by admitting that I had given up waiting since\nI was sure that ""Godot"" himself will have arrived long before that particular moment would ever happen for Roop.\nI really don\'t like to suffer ! And... as long as I don\'t have to suffer I can put on Petty\'s ""Hard Promises"", f.e.,\nin order to feel good. No need to look for songs there,\nno need to wait, and I simply rather listen to stories-in-song about people who are up to ""Something Big"" instead of\ntheir results just like... well, this is big for you I suppose.\nIt\'s been such an astounding success.\nI can be astounded without having to suffer, okay ?\n\nThere\'s so many people out there for whom ""DSotM"" is the best album that\'s ever been made.\nMy review is not aiming at putting them down -\nI just don\'t get it.\nIt may be my fault.\nI made someone else happy at least - when I came to gift him the latest copy I had purchased ( in order to give it one more try ).

bushdoctor,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The Dark Side Of The Moon van Pink Floyd is zowat het meest iconische album aller tijden. Het album stond van 1973 tot in 1988 onafgebroken in de Billboard Album top 100 (een record), hoewel het slechts 1 week op nummer 1 stond. Er zijn ondertussen bijna 50 miljoen exemplaren van verkocht en het blijft nog steeds nieuwe fans aantrekken. Over de verklaring van dit commercieel succes zijn bibliotheken volgeschreven. De voornaamste reden is dat de muziek tot de verbeelding spreekt. De teksten zijn eigenlijk redelijk simpel en mindere muzikanten zouden er wellicht mee uitgelachen worden, maar Pink Floyd weet hoe ze een song moeten opbouwen om het plaatje uiteindelijk toch te laten kloppen. Het hele album staat vol met auditieve details waaraan duidelijk lang gewerkt is geweest. De atmosferische klanken genereren ongekende emoties en muzikaal meanderen de nummers tussen psychedelica, jazz, rock en blues. De twee hitsingles Money en Time zijn misschien niet echt typische nummers die je in de hitparades zou verwachten, maar eigenlijk kan je hetzelfde zeggen van het album zelf. Niemand had kunnen verwachten dat dit zo een succesverhaal zou worden en er bestaat nog steeds geen echte verklaring hiervoor. Dus daarom… indien je een van de weinigen bent die dit album nog nooit heeft gehoord, rep je dan naar de tweedehandsplatenwinkel waar je het album voor enkele euro’s kan aanschaffen en luister er enkele keren zeer gefocust naar.

comusduke,"['What is there left to objectively say about “DSoTM” that hasn’t been said before, probably more often than you’d like? That’s right: anecdotes or personal recollections; I’ve never been good with the former, whereas the latter fall easily into mediocrity, thanks to my chicken memory; I’ll nevertheless try to share what I do remember about how I was firstly introduced to the sound which defined an era so much, that nothing remained the same after it was released:\n\nBy the end of 1973, I already owned “Meddle”, “Relics” and “Ummagumma”, and was fairly acquainted with “Atom Hear Mother” and the one I thought was their latest effort, “Obscured by Clouds”; I’d just finished an year long stint in Luanda, Angola, where the only record I remember having found in a record shop, which I though worth owning, was a mid-sixties Joan Baez EP, and where I had absolutely no access to music-mags and the only Radio program I’d listen to, was made by a recent friend who actually used to borrow my LPs whenever he’d ran out of novelties to air in his program; So, when I found myself in an European capital, Vienna, Austria, it was like I’d landed on another planet, and when I saw posters announcing the Pink Floyd gig, first thing I did was buying a ticket to heaven.\n\nI’ll spare you to many more details, namely because I cannot really remember them; what I do remember, besides the fact it was the first Quadraphonic gig I’ve ever attended, is that they played some of the tracks from the Live “Ummagumma”, also did “Echoes” and then, all of a sudden there were bells ringing, and an “airplane” which came flying from high above our heads on the sits fronting the stage, flied over the astounded audience – well at least the 16 year old me was completely stupefied - and crashed in a thunder of light with a big bang on the stage; later there was a sax player – an unexpected sound for the band - and a couple of astonishing Black female singers, the closest thing I could compare them to, the great Tina Turner (fronting her Ikettes on Ike’s extended group).\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, I’d learn that I’d attended the European leg of the band’s promotional tour for the album, realize that they had played it from top to bottom, and soon found that almost everybody and his brother owned the album; curiously, or maybe because of that, it was one of those Floyd albums I’ve never owned; it would stay in the charts, virtually longer than almost any other album before or after, would soon be deemed as the audio template anyone who really cared should test their Hi-Fi with, and the masterpiece every new album in the field would afterwards be compared to.\n\nIn spite of all these qualities, I’ve always and still do prefer the ones that came just before and after, i.e “Meddle” and “WYWH”.']",4.50 stars
freis,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'With their previous studio album “Meddle” not counting the soundtrack “Obscured by Clouds” Pink Floyd started to change their style. Especially the 24-minute piece “Echoes” showed the new direction in which Pink Floyd went in the early 70s. “Echoes” was the first attempt of the band to write a 20-minute piece (not counting the instrumental Atom Hear Mother Suit) with a meaning, a message and it was a well-constructed piece. Now in 1973 the band decided to go a step further: Roger Waters, the bassist and main songwriter wanted to create a concept album. The album deals with various stages and problems of a human in the modern world like death, consumerism, insanity (of course inspired by the mental illness of the former bandleader Syd Barret), Violence and isolation. The rest of the band: David Gilmour on guitar and lead vocals, drummer Nick Mason and Rick Wright on keyboard, piano, organs etc. agreed to create this concept album and to go into a new more progressive direction. Most of the musical ideas of the album were developed while the band jammed and every band member was involved. But the driving force was Roger Waters: He wrote all the texts and became the new bandleader and main songwriter. After Syd Barret quit or had to quit every band member tried to write and compose music but with “The Dark Side of the Moon” this process ended and Waters became the creative force of Pink Floyd.\n\nThe album starts with a collage of different sounds like heartbeats, ticking clocks and cash registers. These sounds are recurrent elements on the whole album, a typical element for a concept album. Musically the album is pure progressive rock. But there are a lot of other influences: There are some space rock passages, blues oriented songs like “Us & Them” and some of the chord progressions played by pianist Richard Wright are Jazz-inspired.\n\nThe album was performed live in its entirety long time before it was actually released. The band observed the reaction of the crowd and changed some things. “Time” used to be a slow bluesy song; “On the Run” was a jamming instrumental without any electronic synthesizer elements and “Brain Damage” had an additional guitar solo, which wasn’t used for the final version of the album.\n\nYou have to listen the album in its entirety of course but there are some great songs, which are very listenable without the whole concept like “Time”, one of my all time favorite Pink Floyd songs, which includes a sensational guitar work by David Gilmour, the final “Brain Damage/Eclipse”, which is the emotional culmination of the whole album, I was at a show of a very good Pink Floyd cover band called “Crazy Diamond” and when they played this song at the end of a long “Dark Side of the Moon Medley” all around me 50 year old men were crying. This really impressed me. Other great songs are the sad and slow “Us & Them”, which has beautiful vocal harmonies and also “The Great Gig in the Sky” is a phenomenal piece “sung” by Clare Torry. She went to the studio sung her part in one take and thought it was terrible and wanted to another take, but it was exactly what Roger Waters and pianist Rick Wright had in mind. This song always gives me cold shiver; no other song without any lyrics can do that. And also “Money”, the hit single from the album is a great tune. The message of the song is how bad consumerism is and ironically it became the band’s biggest selling single.\n\nThe album truly is a masterpiece and sold millions of copies, it stayed in the album charts for nearly 14 years! It’s an album I listen since years on regular bases and it never gets old. I just bought a HI FI system with a record player. I have to get this album on vinyl and listen to it again.

Infamously surviving on the billboard charts for around 15 years, this album is inevitably one of the greatest masterpieces of 20th century music.

It would have been much better if they added some kind of beat in ""Speak to Me"" or if they had some variation in that dull tune that Richard Wright played on the minimoog in ""On the Run"". Those two tracks sounded much better in the tribute album that The Flaming Lips, Peaches, Stardeath, the White Dwarfs, and Henry Rollins did. Another thing that often makes me sick is the long guitar and high-pitched guitar solos that David Gilmour does especially in ""Time"". I mean, it\'s not horrible or anything, but I don\'t want to listen to slowbeat solos like Kenny-G on guitar, I want to listen to some psychedelia, spacey-ness, some trance! Moving onto the vocals, I thought that the vocals on this album were awesome-ly done. Besides punk rock, I thought this album was one of those which had pretty much non-special vocalists (besides Clare Torry on ""The Great Gig in the Sky"") but had some nice vocals.

If they get too annoying a group of haters emerges dissing both fans and the thing they ramble about, seeing themselves as the messengers of good taste. The fate of the object itself is determined by which of the two groups is the bigger one.\nPink Floyds work has been experiencing this struggle for some time now, getting to the point where the struggle itself is what causes the annoyance. While its true that Pink Floyd has been a great source of inspiration for many well known proyects; their innovation is debatable (I like to think that King Crimson and Frank Zappa influanced them, at leat on the post-Barret part of their career), its the same for claiming that DSotM is their best.\nMost of the tracks that feature vocals are great (Money being my personal favourite), but the instrumentals are lacking the same degree of energy that many of their contemporaries had. Not to say that they lacked on the technical ablility spectrum, Pink Floyd didn't cared for that. No, what they lack is the inventiveness from those other bands, the same inventiveness that Floyd showcased in their latter proyects. Hell, in the last two years many great bands like Yes, Genesis and Gentle Giant had released genre defining albums.

From the first listen, I was pretty hooked by this wave of sound, the mix of head-bobbin\' rock, weird synth passages, and catchy pop hooks, and generally this wonderful flow and evolution of the music. It feels very much like a symphony, I\'m sure those guys studied and used classical music theory. And they didn\'t show off. I also love this use of spoken samples before there even were samples.\n\nBut what really makes this album great to me is the lyrics. I normally don\'t care too much, -- rare is the poetry that touches my cynical heart, and musicians are musicians and not philosophers -- but this album speaks about those great existential themes of any human being: life (""Breathe""), time (""Time""), death (""Great Gig in the Sky""), greed (""Money""), conflict (""Us and Them""), madness (""Brain Damage""). Not that they have got anything new to say -- again, this is pop music, not a philosophical treatment --, but they find beautiful, striking images; they realize, and they care. And this is what differentiates it from oh so many overrated guitar-wankin\' showin\'-off artsy prog rock shit for soft nellies.\n\nThe album is dominated by the three longest tracks. My favourite is ""Time""; the way the songs flips from the long, dark intro into its funky, strong rock beat is just perfect, and I love the genuine anger and passion in Gilmour\'s voice. ""Money"" is also a monster, with its cool 7/4 rhythm that feels funky and catchy, and the great rave-up solo. Finally, the dreamy, surreal ""Us and Them"" with its weird chord progression and its sad, true lyrics -- just as sad as ""Brain Damage"" with the wonderful line ""There\'s someone in my head, but it\'s not me.""\n\nI\'m really glad I listened to this again, this album really has grown on me with each listen and has definitively deserved its status among critics and fans. It is varied, beautiful and occasionally a little disturbing; it is both intellectual and emotional; and it has got great lyrics about important themes. I\'m now looking forward to the other PF albums on my list..\n\nBy the way, I listed to the Experience Edition, which offers a bonus CD with a live version of The Dark Side of the Moon recorded at Wembley 1974; it\'s nice, and probably great for fans, but it didn\'t make me discover anything new about the album.\n\n\nAll you touch and all you see\nIs all your life will ever be.\n\n\nAnd bloody cool album cover, too.']",4.50 stars
KreepyKat,"[""Il y a des disques comme ça, on a beau tenter d'avoir une grille de lecture, une analyse un minimum objective, un sens de la mesure, rien n'y fait, on n'y arrive pas. On cherche des explications, on pense que c'est peut-être dû à un hypothétique effet « Madeleine de Proust ». Mais non, ça ne convainc pas, il y a forcément autre chose.\n\nDark Side of the Moon est mon disque préféré. Est-ce à dire que je suis systématiquement en extase lorsque je l'écoute ? Même pas. Oh, cela arrive souvent, bien sûr, mais parfois l'album m'ennuie, puis je le redécouvre un instant plus tard, bref, mon ressenti évolue. C'est finalement assez rare. Mais puisque mon avis est aussi peu fixe, pourquoi donc le mettre dans une telle position, vous savez, celle qui dit - et là, imaginez un panneau clignotant, style publicité bien agressive pour les yeux : « CET ALBUM EST LA PLUS GRANDE CRÉATION MUSICALE QU'IL AIT JAMAIS EXISTÉ SUR TERRE (classique excepté). » (D'ailleurs, petite parenthèse au passage, mettre un album dans une telle position de supériorité, c'est forcément un peu con, en soi. Disons plutôt que si je ne devais garder qu'un disque, ce serait celui-là. Ou un disque de Brahms. ...'tain même dans une parenthèse, je m'embrouille tout seul).\n\nEt donc, après une affirmation aussi déraisonnable, vient le moment de s'expliquer. Et là, plusieurs choix : on peut se lancer dans un torrent d'éloges forcément partiales et subjectives (j'ai du mal à voir l'intérêt pour une œuvre aussi connue et célébrée que Dark Side mais pourquoi pas), on peut tenter l'analyse objective (enfin, si le but est de montrer en quoi cet album est mieux que tous les autres, il sera dur de rester objectif), on peut faire dans la chronique nostalgique, et préciser ainsi son rapport, son attachement à l’œuvre. J'ai décidé de faire dans la chronique introspective chiante. Ceci pour une simple raison : je trouve cet album génial, vraiment, sincèrement, et j'ai pour lui un immense respect, mais je suis incapable d'expliquer ce ressenti, de l'appuyer avec des arguments, rien, que dalle. Et quand j'essaie, rien ne va, ça sonne faux, ça ne décrit rien, ni le disque ni ma fascination pour lui.\n\n« Mais alors, tais-toi » me crie le fan obtus de Pink Floyd en moi, « puisque tout a été écrit sur ce monument, arrête de faire chier ton monde et lis les arguments des autres, ça te suffira et te confortera dans ton opinion. » Et c'est là que ça coince. Je n'ai jamais rien lu de définitif dessus, que ce soit dans les bouquins officiels, sérieux, documentés, ou dans les critiques du site (je ne vise personne en particulier, hein).\n\nSi on reprend un peu les arguments qu'on trouve ici et là, qu'est-ce qu'on a ?\n« Une homogénéité unique, un immense morceau de 40 minutes ». Même pas. C'est un album fluide, d'accord, mais homogène, non, vraiment, non. A deux exceptions près, les pistes sont distinctes les unes par rapport aux autres, avec de gros contrastes qui plus est. Sans même parler de « Money », j'ai du mal à voir un seul et même morceau lorsque l'on passe de « Any Colour You Like » à « Brain Damage ». Ou alors le Clandestino de Manu Chao est un chef d’œuvre d'homogénéité.\n« Un album hypnotique, mélancolique, tragique ». Oui, certes. C'est un début d'explication, mais c'est loin d'être le seul, et j'estime que certains sont allés bien plus loin dans cette veine-là (quoi, qui a dit Mano Solo?).\n« Un mixage parfait, des compositions parfaites, des paroles parfaites, des musiciens parfaits. » Alors c'est profondément subjectif, mais j'y reviens pour ajouter quelque chose : je n'aime pas la perfection. J'ai tendance à préférer les accidents, les éléments détonants aux objets lisses, vernis et polis. C'est (entre autres) pour ça que j'aime le punk. Et puis Dark Side n'est pas un album parfait, quand bien même il s'agit de mon préféré. Par exemple, j'ai beau y être fortement attaché, je considère On the Run en deçà du reste. Quant à la supposée virtuosité des musiciens, je suis profondément sceptique. A mon sens, c'est plutôt dans l'alchimie qui existe entre eux que le groupe se distingue.\n« La genèse de l'album est incroyable, toute l'histoire avec Syd Barrett, ça lui confère une dimension supplémentaire absolument inégalée. » Oui, sauf que l'album peut aussi s'écouter (et s'apprécier) sans obligatoirement le replacer dans son contexte. Sans même connaître ce dernier. Toutes les légendes autour de Dark Side aideront certes à prêcher les convaincus, en intrigueront certains, mais dans l'hypothèse où la musique est mauvaise, à la base, alors peu importe tout ceci.\n« L'album a eu un succès monstre, il a fait rêver des millions d'auditeurs, il est resté 809 semaines dans le Billboard 200 ! » Ouais non, là je ne répondrais même pas.\n\nBon, ça suffit, vous avez compris l'idée, et puis j'ai l'impression de faire une critique contre, c'est quand même un comble. Puisqu'il y a mieux, sous tous les aspects, sous tous les angles, alors pourquoi cet album se distingue autant ? Et là, fort logiquement, il y a l'ultime argument, l'imparable : c'est la somme de toutes ces qualités qui donne sa majesté à l’œuvre, qui l'élève au-dessus des autres. Non, ça ne me convainc pas non plus. Ça donne un aspect recette de cuisine. Sans compter que c'est loin d'être le seul album à posséder un grand nombre de qualités, sous plusieurs angles différents.\n\nAlors quoi ? Ce serait parce que j'ai découvert Pink Floyd avant de posséder une culture musicale décente, et que maintenant je ne veux pas me résigner à laisser le trône à une autre œuvre que cette madeleine de Proust géante ? Je n'ai pas découvert Pink Floyd il y a si longtemps que ça. Ça fait quelques années, d'accord, mais je n'ai absolument pas le ressenti que j'ai pour des disques que je vénérais durant ma jeunesse (même si je les adore encore, pour pas mal d'entre eux). Depuis que je connais le disque, j'ai écouté beaucoup d'autres choses, mais rien qui ne le fasse vaciller, rien qui ne me fasse remettre en question cette évidence : Dark Side of the Moon tout en haut. Ce n'est pas pour une importance passée, pour un déclic qu'il a produit à un moment précis de ma vie, il a, encore aujourd'hui, encore après des centaines et des centaines d'écoutes, une importance, capitale, pour moi ; une importance qui, loin de s'éroder, se forge au fil des ans.\n\nMais pour quelles raisons ?\nIl y a, c'est certain, les thématiques des chansons qui me touchent. En particulier, « The Great Gig in the Sky », chanson somme, qui réussit à retranscrire avec très peu de paroles toute une gamme de sentiments particulièrement intenses, mais aussi « Time », « Brain Damage », un peu toutes en fait, (sauf peut-être « Money » qui se rattrape largement sur l'instrumentation). Les paroles sont naïves, certes, mais ça ne gâche rien, au contraire, ça donne un aspect fable absolument charmant qui désamorce le côté prétentieux que l'on attribue généralement au groupe.\nIl y a aussi cette impression qui subsiste, celle qui me dit que cet album transpire le vécu. Bien sûr, ce n'est pas un sentiment partagé par tout le monde, mais Dark Side of the Moon, sous ces dehors grandiloquents, est pour moi un album profondément intimiste. C'est un album qui me parle. Pour moi, Walter, Wright et consorts parviennent à mettre leur sentiments, leurs doutes, et même davantage sur partition.\nIl y a cette sensation d'inertie, de torpeur, planante pour certains, ennuyeuse pour d'autres, qui traverse tout l'album avec une force peu commune. Il y a les chœurs qui, loin de juste soutenir les morceaux, les transcendent, en donnant un côté universel et mystique au tout. Il y a aussi des moments de relâchement au milieu d'autres bien plus douloureux, les couplets de « Us and Them », le délire instrumental de « Any Colour You Like », l'album est varié et passe par toute une palette d'émotion.\n\nBon, voilà, on a un début d'explication. C'est plein de contradictions, c'est tout aussi critiquable que les exemples que j'ai mis plus haut et j'en suis conscient. Je ne suis pas totalement convaincu moi-même, je reviendrai sans doute étoffer ça plus tard, mais c'est aussi ce que j'aime, cette sensation de juste effleurer la richesse du truc, de la ressentir sans parvenir à l'exprimer.\n\nMais peut-être qu'il n'y avait pas besoin d'écrire tout ce pavé qui finalement n'intéressera que moi.\nPeut-être que si je disais, tout simplement, que dès que je pense à la musique, dans sa globalité, immédiatement c'est Dark Side of the Moon qui me vient à l'esprit.\nNon ?\nAh non, c'est vrai. Il y a aussi Brahms.""]",5.00 stars

What\'s so special about it?\n\nIf I were to write down all of reasons why I\'d probably fail my academic education, cause I\'m during my examination period, as it would take me so long. From the technical point of view it\'s innovatory - Pink Floyd introduces synthesizers, as well as common sounds of everyday (very, very atmosphere-creating), into rock music. Also, it\'s the album, in which every detail is perfectly touched up. If you\'d listen to early version (for example live at Rainbow Theatre in London 20.02.1972) and final, the one we all know, you will see a significant difference and a lot of work that Pink Floyd and technicans put into the creating process of the Dark Side. It\'s not like ""David, play something, we will put in this place, ok, done"", there has been a lot of sweat put into rounding this album into one piece, as it took more than a year of time. Let me mention guitar solos in Time and Money to prove I\'m right. As it\'s concept album, the lyrics are memorable and meaningful, and every song is honestly taking up another issue, another trouble of humanity. Excepts of interviews supports and completes them in perfect way, giving the album another atmospheric dimension.\n\nIf only I could give this album a 6,0, I would. It\'s the best and my personal favourite album, atmospheric and melodiously excellent from Speak to Me to the climax of Eclipse, the masterpiece of not only rock but music in overall, which shall be remembered forever. After the point of Dark Side, rock music just couldn\'t and can\'t get better. It\'s full of wonderful matter, which message is rather pessimistic, but in spite of it, listening to it uplifts much. Altrough some of the songs are visibly worse than the rest (On the Run, Any Colour You Like) I treat Dark Side of the Moon as one, perfect, 43 minute song.

LoafNug,"['The Dark Side of the Moon is distinguished for me by its being the first record I played on my own record player. The Dark Side of the Moon is a perfect ""first record"" album; the subtle nuances and recording tricks of the album can be appreciated more with a stereo sound. Opener ""Speak to Me"" is a heart palpating instrumental that sets up the sonic landscape of the album. The way the bass beats into the beginning of the album is the bands way of showing the fear contained within. The Dark Side of the Moon is a very anxiety ridden and almost insane musical exercise. Waters and the rest of the band capture insanity in musical form. Discomfort is a major theme throughout the album. The guitars slide awkwardly around in ""Breathe,"" almost unsure of their purpose. ""Breathe"" has disheartening lyrics that include ""leave but don\'t leave me."" It feels like a drug addled day dream. Then ""On the Run"" is a sonic spacejam that builds tension upon itself in layers before bursting at the seams with guitar riffs at its close. The beat of the song is enough to set your blood pumping. The spoken word samples are buried in the mix to make the listener strain to hear them; an act of physical discomfort. The manic cuckoo cuckoo clock ridden opening of ""Time"" is another classic example of Pink Floyd using dramatic sounds to increase tension in the listener. The guitar riff of ""Time"" accompanied by the spare drumming and twinkling synths is one of the better psychedelic tracks in the whole compendium. The music is so dense; the production leaves lots of little things to pick up on repeat listens. Also the vocal work of the backing female vocalists is extraordinary and really gives the album the push that it needs. ""Time"" really is one of the better songs they have produced; from the guitar work to the bass to Water\'s vocals everything surmounts into a perfect Pink Floyd song. The use of double tracking and dubbing feels novel for being in such an older LP, and their production tricks set the pace for other bands to experiment with their production. ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" feels a bit wooden to me perhaps. I like the transition from ""Time"" into ""The Great Gig in the Sky,"" but the song feels a bit too slow and out of place on the album to me. Its almost too safe, too calm to fit into the manic energy of the album. The sliding guitars are nice. As are guest vocalist Clare Torry\'s incantations. Her vocals runs are pretty memorable, and thankfully save the song.\nSide B begins with money. The literal sounds of cash chinking and cash registers being pulled are heard in the intro to ""Money."" The funky guitar lines are supported by a smooth bass. David Gilmour\'s vocal delivery is perfect for the song which is a sardonic song about the glamorous life that comes with wealth. Its a statement on what would cause the insanity that the rest of album deals with. Side B deals more with what cause desperation and insanity in a strict society; and what that can result in. The guitar solo at the end of ""Money"" is one of the best in classic rock. The disjointed riffs are joined together by a spiraling hook and more strong bass riffs. Its just great classic rock, space rock, progressive rock, whatever you want to call it it just plain rocks. ""Us and Them"" has a cold warbled opening before sinking into an almost jazz like ambiance. David Gilmour delivers great verses that have smooth jazz playing that give the whole song such a chilled feeling. The choruses are large; both female vocalists and Richard Wright join in and they are louder in comparison to the rest of the song. The whole thing feels so grandiose and anthemic. Lyrically its a song about isolation. Like most Pink Floyd songs, its very psychedelic and metaphoric in nature. The song has so many hidden quirks in it that it is another contender for best song on the album. ""Any Colour You Like"" is another instrumental interlude. Its an early example of synthesized sounds being used in electronic music and sounds like a cornerstone for the entire space rock genre. ""Brain Damage"" is one of the most disturbing songs I\'ve heard by any band. The lyrics alone are frightening, and Roger Waters delivers them in such a menacing way. Its the song on which the entire album is predicated on; the themes and emotions delivered in its four minutes are just as effective as the entire album as a whole. The segue into ""Eclipse"" is perfect, and is the only feasible way to end the album.\nThe Dark Side of the Moon in almost 40 years old. This is the first time I\'ve listened to it in its entirety. It still holds up as an extremely capable experiment by a band that still had something to say. They made a wonderful record with The Dark Side of the Moon, that I hope my children will listen to some day.\n\nListen To: ""Speak to Me,"" ""Breathe,"" ""On the Run,"" ""Time,"" ""The Great Gig in the Sky,"" ""Money,"" ""Us and Them,"" ""Brain Damage,"" ""Eclipse""\nAvoid: None']",5.00 stars

YoSaffBridge,"[""Dark Side of the Moon. Quite possibly the single most important non-Beatles album ever made. Every note has entered the cultural subconscious. Every analogy is known. Excerpts play in Olympic ceremonies. The album cover is...the most iconic album cover ever? God knows what you'd throw in against it. It plays from the beginning note to the end in absolute cohesion. Every song adds to the overall storyline. It starts how it should, it ends how it should and it knows precisely when to go angry, when to go thoughtful, or when to go poignant. It's also one of the highest selling albums ever, and I would argue a much more deserving winner of the “best selling album ever” award than the two who beat it, Thriller and Back in Black. Thriller is there because of the singles, and Back in Black is just songs. This uses the album format to its fullest potential, creating a smooth listening experience.\n\nWhen I first heard this I was young. Young enough to not understand it, and young enough to declare the album unequivocally “overrated”. One day I tried it again and realised that I'd been wrong. This deserves its praise. I had it as a 5-star once, but despite my effusiveness, I'm not actually so deeply in love with it. I'm detached and on the outside.

I\'m not criticizing the technical ability of the singer, but Pink Floyd just had her wail aimlessly instead of carrying any sort of melody, which makes the attempt at being emotional just seem overwrought and cringeworthy to listen to. I don\'t like ""Us and Them"" for similar reasons, it\'s really boring, and I hate the use of the saxophone, which recalls smooth jazz for me.\n\nThere are two songs I like on The Dark Side of the Moon though, and those are ""Brain Damage"" and ""Eclipse."" I think there is something about singing about Syd Barrett that makes Pink Floyd write with sincerity, it makes the music emotional and gripping, like on their superior follow-up Wish You Were Here. ""Brain Damage"" and ""Eclipse"" are the catchiest and poppiest tunes on the album, welcome departures from the noodly guitar playing and instrumental textures that make up the majority of Dark Side. I always get goosebumps when I hear the band sing ""The sun is eclipsed by the moon!""\n\nOverall, this album is okay, but nowhere near worth the admiration that has made it into an icon of modern society. I will give Dark Side credit for having such amazing production though, it still sounds relatively modern, everything is so clear, despite it being made in the 70s.\n\nAnd for you Radiohead fans out there, the chord progression to ""Eclipse"" is pretty similar to ""Wolf at the Door!""

A number of the tracks here aren\'t really songs at all - ""Speak to Me"", ""On the Run"", ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", ""Brain Damage"" - these are musical interludes between songs. While most of these are great, ""On the Run"" doesn\'t do much for me. There are really only six actual songs on this album and five of them are incredibly good, but not quite to the level of ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" or ""Wish You Were Here"" from the following album. ""Money"" never did too much for me other than containing an excellent guitar solo. What really kicks this into high gear the overall menacing, scary tone throughout the album which works perfectly with the biting lyrics - it creates an almost magical kind of synergy that\'s probably impossible to plan. The production is pristine, particularly for 1973.\n\nOne other thing - although Waters wrote all the lyrics, this album is really a group effort. Every member (including Wright and Mason) is credited with at least co-writing some of the songs and Gilmour and Wright do a lot of the singing. There are some really nice three way vocals as well with Waters, Wright and Gilmour all singing, making the vocal parts more interesting than on their later albums. A little overrated in my opinion, but certainly a great album.']",4.50 stars

progandother,"['I firstly wanna start this review with a vendetta on a certain author who wrote a certain book on this album with such a bollocky analysis it actually makes my little sister cry. Yes she fell over on the patio (STEVE!!) but that is not the point!\n\nSheila Whiteley\'s book ""The Space Between the Notes"" contains a long-winded, horrifically dumb analysis of this album that seems to take messages and complexity out of it which really are not there. She practically feeds the idea that Pink Floyd managed to predict nuclear war and technological swoops of death and rats attacking our feet. Men cowering in fear as their ipods start to put THEM on shuffle, women deciding they no longer want to be pregnant and getting ebay to do it for them, boyfriends and girlfriends having sex with google, pennies and stuff.\n\nAlso she manages to notice the IV-I progression in every song like it\'s some kind of fucking revelation, it\'s called continuity. Thousands of albums did it before the fucking black freud blob!\n\nPink Floyd\'s nth album Dark Side of the Buttock is a turning point for fandom on the band. Dividing and multiplying a shitload of people into different circles, some worshipping this as the God of fertility imported from Portugal while others spat at it and decided to buy a suit and be coroporate MEEEEEEEEEEEEYAN!!\n\nThe whole album is basically four songs: Breath, Time, Money, Us and Them, and the other one that appears at some point. I\'d have to check the back of my CD or look it up to work it out but...nah.\n\nThe rest are artsy intervals, not that they\'re bad or anything. I mean the vocal solo in The Great Gig in the Sky may sound forced as shoving a pineapple in the anus but it certainly is worth Jack Black\'s recommendation to that one large girl who wanted to be a vocalist in that one film. Escape sounds like a choo choo train in a tunnel and the rest are a shitload of mellotron synth classy solos to show that they can progress chords over samples and not sound like Stockhausen\'s younger sister. They cool but I\'d like to have more choice on colour than ""Any colour"". NO!! There are certain visual elements my retina are unable to comprehend and it would be nice to put some consideration into them.\n\nAs for the regular songs? I find them a bit up and down. While there really is some great atmosphere developed by Breath and Time and the solo in the latter is certainly ""urghanta"" emphasising. I just get this feeling from them that they\'re trying to be immersive when they fail miserably. The whole production aesthetic, guitar tone, instrumental clusters seem to assume you are going to be high when you listen to this. Because this vulnerability will allow you to assume even crickets raping an electric shaver has some potential (as it always should). Further more the vocals really egg it for me, I find them cutting and out of place. The unnecessary doubling technique on every line takes away from this more symbiotic guitar shit...y\'know? Because that makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\nMoney is atrocious and quite possibly the most easy punchbag for anti-fans for the simple fact that paper is very punchable. 5/4 is not all that either, anyone can write a song in 5/4 by simply writing ""5/4"" after the clef. IT DOESN\'T GIVE AUTOMATIC COMPLEXITY!!\n\nBut yeah the songs are alright and that, but they don\'t really hold a candle to Us and Them which manages to not carry itself as ridiculously as the other songs whilst having a very soothed up build up. The saxophone playing is very well blended and the vocals are sparse and in between the chords, making you feel like you\'re outside the window of a planetarium. Definitely worth listening to, especially when the chorus makes me feel like starting a new Monster Rancher save file.\n\nAs far as I can tell this one has a shitload of discussion already and I don\'t want to add the same shim everyone has said. It\'s an album, a reasonable sized album. The length is adequate, also there are people playing on this. They are of the caucasian ethnicity, they are from England and they like money. They also have no Time for you and me but they have time to twat about with a woman who starts shouting for no good reason.\n\nIt\'s good alright, nice atmosphere and stuff.

The greatest moment in this album, however, has to be to medley in D constructed out of the last 3 songs, the psychedelic funky 12 bar Any Colour You Like and the almost humorous, dark Brain Damage hitting the listener with amazing rhythms, chord work and jazz influenced prog rock before summing up all of the lyrics in the last song; Eclipse.""]",5.00 stars

Fascinado por el álbum The wall y tras el reciente visionado de la película de Alan Parker que se inspira en el disco del mismo nombre, no tenía ningún reparo en ubicar a Pink Floyd como uno de mis grupos favoritos de todos los tiempos (aunque ese ""todos los tiempos"" eran unos bisoños 15 años). Así se lo hacía saber a propios y extraños e inclusive lo colocaba en los famosos slams de las épocas del colegio: cuadernos en los que las chicas hacían una serie de preguntas para que sean respondidas de la manera más seria posible, muchas de las cuales giraban en torno a situaciones del corazón, aunque no faltaban las interrogantes acerca de los gustos. Justamente una de esas chicas tenía un aparente embrollo romántico conmigo y ante la evidencia de que Pink Floyd aparecía en letras grandes como una de mis bandas favoritas, se le ocurrió la brillante idea de regalarme un cassette de la banda. Y lo hizo. Me entregó The dark side of the moon.\n\nLo que recuerdo es que coloqué el cassette en mi equipo con fascinación y esperé escuchar el sonido avasallador de The wall, el único referente Floydiano que conocía en ese momento. Y por supuesto, no pasó nada de eso. Por el contrario, lo que escuché fue una obra aburrida, hermética, sin ninguna pizca de apasionamiento salvo uno que otro momento interesante. Sí, claro: Speak to me cumplía bien su papel de intro fascinante, Breathe se dejaba escuchar y uno perdonaba los escarceos experimentales de On the run, pero con el intro inacabable de Time las cosas ya se ponían realmente pesadas y uno, a sus quince años, dejaba de escuchar el disco. Si a ello le sumamos el gospel de The great gig in the sky, el lado A no cerraba de la mejor manera. Vuelta al cassette y tras la escucha de Money, otro bajón para un chiquillo, el resto de la obra simplemente transcurría sin pasión hasta que terminaba. ¿Cuál fue el saldo? La devolución del regalo y la duda de si realmente había escuchado al mismo grupo o no.\n\nPor supuesto, mucha agua ha pasado bajo la corriente desde ese entonces y Pink Floyd se ha convertido en una de mis bandas favoritas justamente por esa capacidad tan innata en ellos de hacer de cada disco una obra diferente y alejada de la otra. Y The dark side of the moon no se diferencia en ello de las anteriores. Cierto es que se pierde la vena experimental y casi exploratoria de sus discos anteriores, generosos en largas improvisaciones instrumentales. Aquí se cohesionan las canciones pero se explora en el concepto de la locura, en cierta vena existencial que intenta indagar en el por qué de la vida y en lo que somos frente a otros escenarios que nos rodean: el dinero, el tiempo, los otros, las razas, la paranoia... Us and them es eso: la evidencia del yo frente a los otros. Y el disco es también la evidencia de la magia de Richard Wright, generalmente relegado en lo que se refiere al aporte de cada uno de los integrantes de la banda.\n\nEste es también el disco que generará el reconocimiento mundial a un cuarteto que se movía más bien en los recovecos del underground. Es la placa que los hará mediáticos, millonarios y reconocidos por una audiencia que no dejará de girar el plástico en sus respectivas casas. Posicionado como uno de los discos más vendidos de todos los tiempos, será también el que origine la ruptura, la gran pregunta posterior: ¿y ahora qué? Y generará una herida que ya no cicatrizará jamás en el futuro de la banda, aunque será justamente la siguiente obra la que explore lo mejor de Pink Floyd. Y la locura es el tema que quizás haya estado presente desde un inicio en la propuesta musical del grupo y que se prolongará hasta ese disco doble llamado The wall.\n\nLa edición Immersion de The dark side of the moon no puede ser mejor. No solo podemos apreciar las distintas versiones de mezcla por las que pasó el disco, incluyendo una temprana de 1972 y las versiones surround y cuadrafónicas, sino que también podemos apreciar algunos demos y versiones en vivo de composiciones tempranas que luego evolucionaron en los himnos que conocemos de memoria. Adicional a ello, están los diversos acompañamientos visuales que se han convertido en elementos fundamentales de la puesta en escena de la banda, así como otros cachivaches de colección que incluyen posavasos, canicas, bufandas, cartillas de colección, álbum de fotos y demás artilugios que hacen las delicias de los coleccionistas.\n\nTres canciones básicas: Breathe, Brain damage y Us and them']",5.00 stars

jweber14,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""Okay so lets take a trip back in time to the year 1973. Elton John just made his first number one single, disco music was just starting to enter mainstream culture, and Stevie Wonder was the hugest sensation since The Beatles. Now lets analyze Pink Floyd from a historical perspective. Pink Floyd was struggling to gain mainstream support, particularly in America, and after Syd Barrett's departure in 1968, Floyd started experimenting with different ideas and album concepts, some met with great success like Meddle, others being disappointing such as Ummagumma and Obscured by Clouds. After releasing a superb album with one of the earliest and awesome epics known as Echoes, Floyd decided to get more experimental and well Obscured by Clouds is for from a bad album, it just isn't that great or memorable either. After Obscured by Clouds, Floyd needed something more accessible that could reach to a more mainstream audience. It was at this time that Waters began having more interest in the synthesizer and electronic sounds. You can tell that Floyd became more innovative and creative during this time period. Dark Side flows perfectly from start to finish with each song having its own distinct sound and mood. The things with Dark Side is that it really is a technically complicated album, especially compared with other progressive bands during the time, but Dark Side is really about the feel and how each part is layered and placed into the song. Dark Side is full of so many layers of synths, soulful guitar solos, surreal harmonies, that the album just seems to ooze quality. The production quality is especially well for an early 70s album, but this comes with no surprise seeing as Alan Parsons was the engineer for Dark Side. My favorite moments of Dark Side are Wright's mellow and warm organ chords in Us and Them, the chaotic yet beautiful high pitched screaming in Great Gig in the Sky, as well as Gilmour's guitar solo in Time and the synth segment at the end of Brain Damage. Rarely have I encountered an album that flowed as well as Dark Side, and each layer of sound has its own distinct personality. For 1973 this music was quite groundbreaking and sounded different than anything else during its time, and that's why it is #1 all time for a reason. 40 years later and its still groundbreaking and highly enjoyable, and not many bands can live up to the standard created by Pink Floyd.""]",5.00 stars

The songs segue from one to another and form two side long suites, but unlike Atom Heart Mother this is not apparent from the sleeve notes. It was a much more commercial record than any previous Floyd (like, duh, but I mean the band probably thought that when they were making it too) although there are some ""experimental"" wheezes, notably the conversation samples which I believe were from interviews conducted with non-musical studio staff (eg the tea lady) and which are dropped into the segue sections. Quite a lot of tape sampling as well, and the opening Speak to Me is actually pretty weird if you listen to it rather than just treating it as an intro.

Hawkeyes89,"['Dark Side of the Moon is the unfortunate standard bearer for most over hyped/rated album of all time. There are several reasons for this; it\'s lenghthy stay on the album charts, a band breaking through at the right time, and the fact that a great band like Pink Floyd released a conventional 70\'s rock album as opposed to nearly every other album of consequence they\'ve done which features epic side long tracks or elaborate concepts. This allowed for increased radioplay to the point where music fans who weren\'t Pink Floyd fans before gained enough exposure/motivation to go out to the record store and buy it. In light of this, Dark Side of the Moon probably isn\'t one of the top ten albums of all time but is still one of the best of its decade.\n\nAs for the tracks themselves, everything here is at least ""good"" with most tracks being above average to excellent. The only two tracks I don\'t care for and the transition tracks ""On the Run"" and ""The Great Gig in the Sky"". ""Money"" is another track, despite being the most often played from this album thought never justified its immense popularity. The lyrical portion is thoroughly mediocre but the jazzy ending makes up for it. The section that makes this album worth listening to is the Closing 4 track suite. Honestly they could have packaged this as one 17 minute track but perhaps, in an aim at commercial success split it into its current format. Worthy of being the fifth best album of all time? No, but certainly an essential addition to any collection.\n\nFavorites: ""Speak to Me/Breathe"" ""Us and Them/Any Colour You Like/Brain Damage/Eclipse""']",4.50 stars
Moonbeam,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Acclaimed Music Top 100 Albums Project: Album #21\n\nIn general, I\'m not a fan of progressive rock. As such, I have generally tried to avoid Pink Floyd and approached The Dark Side of the Moon with caution. I feared that I would be met with super-extended drugged-out dirges, but instead, this album is thankfully a bit more relatable and concise. In that sense, The Dark Side of the Moon proved to be a relief, but it also ended up being a disappointment.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is purportedly built around a concept of lapsing time, isolation, insanity and death. The band thus sets themselves quite the challenge, and while I can appreciate the gravitas of such a quest, it doesn\'t work for me. I think the primary culprit in all of this is the vocals. Something about the languid vocals of David Gilmour and Roger Waters almost renders these songs as caricatures, taking the air out of the balloons they\'re so desperately trying to inflate. Indeed, my favorite tracks here are the synthy instrumentals ""On the Run"" and ""Any Colour You Like"" and the pleading wordless wails of Clare Torry on ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", which is the only track that manages to capture the monolithic grandeur apropos for the concept.\n\nAlthough the ambition of the concept is not met to my ears, I felt that there would be some instrumental mastery that would at least gauge my attention. And while there are spurts here and there in the form of guitar solos and atmospheric touches, these were not enough to maintain my interest. It seems like The Dark Side of the Moon may be a good candidate for repeated listens to unveil hidden intricacies, but there was little for me to latch onto.\n\nUltimately, The Dark Side of the Moon did not annoy me to the degree that I thought it would, nor did it impress me musically like its reputation suggests it should.']",1.50 stars

dfle3,"['Entirely listenable album. 87.5/100.\n\n\nThis isn\'t an album I would have bought out of desire...bought it because I explored this band\'s studio albums from the beginning. Of course, this is an album whose reputation precedes it and which has numerous radio songs off of the album. To tell the truth, no song off this album which gets radio play is usually enough for me to stop and turn the radio up...I usually change stations. ""Us and them"" might be a small exception to that. That being said, I\'m more favourable to these songs in the context of the album...they\'re pleasant and memorable...I can understand people loving these songs more than I do. The cd I bought was the 2003 30th anniversary edition. It has a run time of 42:58 minutes. Sound quality is subdued and overly mellow...not crisp. Not sure how that compares to other versions of the album. On first listen I gave this album 85/100 and bumped it up to 87.5/100 on second listen.\n\n\nThe best song:\n\n\nUs and them - ""."" > ""."". The fake ambient conversation from the previous track (""Money"") continues onto this song and then stops. Churchy sounding organ. Distinctive guitar notes. Cymbals. Subtle bass. Piano. Breathy sax (I think). Memorable vocals wih echoes. Some more fake chat later on. Female backing vocals at times. Subdued sound quality (SSQ).\n\n\nThe rest (in album order):\n\n\nSpeak to me - Quiet, faint beat. Teasers from the album (e.g. the intro from ""Money""), ticking clocks. Spoken voices. Lyric includes the line ""I\'ve been mad for fucking years"".\n\nBreathe - Bleeds on from the previous track. Noticeable bass...laid back vibe with cymbals...drums do appear though. Country flavoured lead guitar, perhaps. Keyboard. Sort of a violin sound...but maybe it\'s a synth.\n\nOn the run - Bleeds on from the previous track. Synthy track with a repetitive swirl. A synth bit sort of like the Sweet\'s ""Fox on the run"", at times (vice versa, of course). Some ambient noises. Helicopter noise...a sound that would reappear in their later masterpiece album ""The wall"". Although this is an instrumental, there are some ambient noises of airport terminal announcements and fake conversations (as in coming off like amateur actors reciting lines).\n\nTime - Bleeds on from the previous track, re ticking clocks. Odd and interesting tone to the drums (perhaps this is done via the synth?). Keyboard. Reflective lyrics concerning how your life is over before you know it. Female backing vocals. Lead vocals rock at times, though genteel often too.\n\nThe great gig in the sky - SSQ. Piano notes. Synth or twangy lead guitar. Bass. Seeming vox pop - a man discusses death, as does a woman at the end. Sort of familiar guitar melody and piano later. Female vocalising...hitting the high notes, and raunchy at times too. Has a little bit of static 23 seconds from the end.\n\nMoney - Iconic cash register intro. Iconic guitar notes. Iconic bass line (one for my list of great songs for the bass parts here). Keyboard. Fake ambient conversations. Nice sing-song vocal melody at times.\n\nAny colour you like - SSQ. Instrumental. Cheesy synth, perhaps. 1970s style funky lead guitar and bass. Cymbals and drums.\n\nBrain damage - Dual lead guitar (?). Organ. Female backing vocals. Hi-hat drums at times. Intriguing lyrics at times, including: ""There\'s one in my head but it\'s not me""; ""The lunatic is on the grass""; "" I\'ll see you on the dark side of the moon"".\n\nEclipse - Hammond organ. Lead guitar. Solid drumming. Recycled lyrics from other songs on this album, perhaps. Female backing vocals. Sort of a heartbeat outro. A male voice says ""There is no dark side of the moon, really. Matter of fact, it\'s all dark"".\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\nPink Floyd - The wall. 9+/10. A narrative concept album with catchy songs.\n\nPink Floyd - ""More"" soundtrack. 8/10. Some pretty songs/instrumentals and two of their heaviest songs, perhaps.\n\nPink Floyd - The piper at the gates of dawn. 7.5+/10. ""Flaming"" is a classic.\n\nPink Floyd - Meddle. 8.25/10. ""One of these days"" is a bit of a lost classic, perhaps.\n\nKing Crimson - In the court of the crimson king. 9/10. ""The court of the crimson king"" is a bona fide classic.\n\nThe Mothers Of Invention - Freak out! 8.5/10. ""Help, I\'m a rock"" is a minor classic.']",4.50 stars

Luego de los cantos de Dave y Rick abre ON THE RUN, una sintesis de locura que me recuerda al viejo Syd, pero esta vez de la mano de algo mas moderno que aquel rock espacial de los años 60, que te ambienta con las voces de un hospital y de un hombre huyendo finalizando con una gran explosion, en la cual comienza a sonar los relojes que nos llevan al, para mi, el mejor tema del album: TIME. Esta suite de siete minutos con aquella hermosa intro que nos lleva a la voz de Gilmour y a los coros de Wright nos muestra la desesperacion de la gente y su agitada vida, algo que sigue siendo reflejado en nuestras vidas actuales, luego de eso aparece aquel magistral solo de guitarra, uno de los mejores en la carrera de Dave. Y asi el lado 1 cierra con THE GREAT GIG IN THE SKY, con los gritos de Clare Torry que me desgarran el alma hasta llevarla a sentir una muerte tranquila y temporal.\nAsi llegamos al lado 2 que abre con MONEY, donde otro solo de guitarra y uno de saxo nos lleva a pensar que cada cancion mejora a la otra y nos habla de la ambicion del hombre por este sucio objeto que, aunque no queramos, es necesario para subsistir.US AND THEM es el tema que con sus letras que hablan sobre xenofobia y el tranquilo piano de Rick nos conlleva a reflexionar sobre esta actitud que mas que mejorar empeora a un pais. Asi llegamos al mas hermoso relleno sicodelico denominado ANY COLOUR YOU LIKE que es el tema que nuca podre entender y mientras mas pienso de que se trata mas me atrapa con sus teclados y guitarras sicodelicas. Ahora se deja sentir la voz de Waters con los temas que cierran este magnifico disco: BRAIN DAMAGE/ECLIPSE, que con la potente critica, y la potente pasion que tiene cada tema de este hombre le dan un cierre dramatico a este disco que seria, el que marca la tendencia al eterno progresivismo.\nEn conclusion podremos ver que mientras mas veces escuchemos este disco mas atrapados quedamos por sus hermosas y simfonicas letras y melodias.

Anyway, the music here is simply stunning, but also very haunting, well certain tracks at least. The general theme of it is well, as broad as the themes of life itself. You have greed, the ever creeping reality of death and age, insanity, war and conflict. hell its all here. oh yeah, next to joy divisions ""Unknown Pleasures"" (which i have yet to hear, review and own) it is probably the best ""simple"" art covers. In a nut shell the prism could represent humanity, the light shining into it equates to life, and the colors represent the themes of life, or the themes of the album, something to ponder i guess.\n\n""Speak to Me/Breathe"" really just two parts to the same song. ""speak to me"" is baisicly a bunch of random sounds slowly entering the periphery of your hearing, most of which is basically a sampling of the sound bites interspersed throughout the album. ""Breathe"" is damn beautiful and reminds me of a sunset or sunrise. Its so laid back, but contains the simple message, to live, to be.\n\n""On the Run"" this one is haunting, its just feels like a chase through a tunnel, apparently it was written by the bands keyboardist Richard wright to show his deafening fear of flying, thus explaining the intercom and running through the airport. the ""live for today, gone for tomorrow"" sound bit sums up the songs message. we are always on the move and we cant slow down.\n\n""Time"" the tolling of various clocks from grandfathers to simple alarm clocks, is the first thing heard. although annoying it does its job well. the slow melodic riff that leads off feels like a western, likes its high noon and the town is deserted and you know a shoot out is about to happen. really love its dramatic use because it creates tension. the lyrics are delievered effectivly and the theme is shoved in your face right away, ""time is all encompassing, you cant escape it, dont waste it because that\'s all you are ever going to get."" i love the backing vocals as well, and the last part of the song ""Breath reprise"" is freaking awesome, basically its a longing for home and its just utter chills!\n\n""The Great Gig in the Sky"" basically the albums song for death, or heaven. its very jazzy surprisingly and its great because it comes off as ""hey i lived a good life if its my time, then its my time"" well thats what i think of with the whaling of the female singer atleast.\n\n""Money"" more sound bites including the infamous ""cha-ching"" from a cash register, quarters dropping, and recites being ripped. Then that classice unappologetic bass riff comes in, so poumpus and arrogant, just like the rich. the albums theme of greed best sumed up with this song. saying how much you can accomplish with it, and more importantly what you can buy.\n\n""Us and Them"" very jazy, ive seen this synced with 2001 before and it surprisingly works. Anyway the theme here is conflict and war, and the absurdity of it. its no ""War Pigs"" thats for sure, but it does its job quit well, and is probably one of the best by the band, its just so understated. Richard wrights opus here.\n\n""Any Color You Like"" my god, 40 some-odd years and it still bleeds through the speakers! i love this song its just a complete trip. im not quite sure what it has to do with anything, but the title might have meaning. Henry Ford told the customer when he was selling the model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as its black"" there you go, the theme is lack of choice. I guess...\n\n""Brain Damage"" the theme of mental illness is perverse here, reminds me of some story book fable coming to life, or the fool on the hill. im hearing a lot about syd barret here. actually it reminds me of ""If"" from Atom Heart Mother, they both have the same theme i guess.\n\n""Eclipse"" the whole album comes full circle, baisicly in a nut shell the songs theme says that all things wether good or bad, are in direct proportion with one another, sorta like karma i guess. or it might mean that if you are affected by a force, and if that force is a worry to you, well I feel exactly the same too, so its sorta like the a butterfly effect.\n\nDamn good album, one of the best in fact, but personally I love Wish You Were Here a little bit more, still though definitely get it!']",4.50 stars

diego21,"['Como lo dije anteriormente, el lado oscuro de la luna fue mi disco favorito por un par de años, y tambien fue un disco que sufrio un poco de sobre-reproduccion. Mas que todo, cuando el resto de mis amigos se dieron cuenta de lo grandioso que era el disco. Pareceria increible, pero Pink Floyd sigue ganando adeptos 30 años despues. Me parece erroneo, casi incomodo ponerme a hablar de DSOFTM, como si ustedes nunca lo hubiesen oido. Es simplemente, algo tan esencial como una sinfonia de Beethoven. Asi que si nunca lo han oido, les estoy dando la oportunidad de que lo hagan.\n\nPuedo hablarles un poco mas de la banda, la cual surgio de un colegio de arte en Cambridge, asi se conocieron los que empezaron la banda, Roger Waters, Richard Wright, Nick Mason, Syd Barrett y posteriormente David Gilmour. La banda empezo tocando en los clubes de por ahi, y consiguieron contrato para grabar su debut, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, un disco que demuestra que tan aterradora y psicologicamente perturbadora puede ser la musica. Luego, el lider de aquel entonces Syd Barret, no pudo con todo lo que estaba pasando, combinado con un cotel de drogas, dejaron muy afectada la salud mental de este, y fue el bajista Roger Waters quien tomo la batuta. Es bajo el mando de este que la banda consigue sus mayores logros, desde el exito comercial de The Wall, hasta este disco, que es considerado el más clasico de la banda. A eso hay que agregar otras joyas como Wish You Were Here o Meddle.\n\nDark Side of the Moon fue grabado en 1973, y es el primer disco con Waters al mando. Fue grabado por Alan Parsons, y utilizo muchas tecnicas poco usadas en aquel entonces. Sintetizadores, sampleos de voces y conversaciones y el hecho de ser un disco conceptual, que jugaba con la vida y las preocupaciones que esta trae como el paso del tiempo en Time, el dinero, pues en Money, la guerra en Us & Them y la ""salud mental"" en Brain Damage. La verdad es que oir Dark Side of the Moon es toda una experiencia, y aunque ya no lo hago tan seguido, siempre disfruto cada vez que lo hago.']",

thecornbreadhour,"[""The story of how I came to first hear this album is kind of embarrassing - my mom bought it for me. And in spite of that I still really liked it.\n\nIt's really trite-sounding to say you like this album, because yeah you and everyone else and their mother, and there's the sense that people expect you not to be so basic, or whatever. In spite of that, though, and in spite of how totally unoriginal I sound saying this, hearing this for the first time was a formative experience for me as a music fan. Pink Floyd ended up opening so many doors for me to other kinds of music and other bands, not all of whom were the same kind of slick MOR bluesy bands that Floyd ultimately are beneath all of the sound effects, high concepts and contemplative lyrics. And I can understand now why people would scoff at its high-mindedness, and generally when other bands (read: Dream Theater) try to imitate it, it never works, but that's because you can't reinvent the wheel. It just goes to show how significant this album has been, in spite of some understandable criticisms and the sense that by this point its relevance to modern music is distant. Because in spite of that, it still represents a high water mark that not every artist can attain, and its age makes it seem almost more impressive. Not to be overly conservative, but this still remains a classic which listeners owe it to themselves to hear at least once in their lives.""]",

davidmxdf,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""Reseña del Dark Side of The Moon\n\nHaciendo un recuento sobre este disco de manera muy personal podría decir lo siguiente:\n\nPosiblemente sea sin no el mejor trabajo de la banda si el que es más reconocido como tal.\nPosiblemente el disco más importante e influyente de la década de los 70’s.\nUno de los tres más importantes e influyentes del rock y de la música en general.\nEl disco con el que Pink Floyd dominaría la escena y se mantendría ahí prácticamente hasta la salida de sus tres trabajos posteriores.\nCalificación Total del disco: 5.0 Excelente (Obra Maestra).\n\nIntroducción.\n\nLa primeras veces que escuche The Dark Side of The Moon fue cuando tenía 9 o 10 años ,de esas primeras escuchas lo que se me quedo mas grabado fue el sonido de los relojes de la canción Time, los sonidos de cajas registradoras de la canción Money así como los sonidos del helicóptero pero sobre todo él solo de la cantante Clare Torry en la canción The Great Gig In the Sky, por lo demás debo decir que me dejaba una tranquilidad, una especie de lejanía, sentimientos un poco raros para un niño pequeño, pero de verdad lo disfrutaba mucho, tenía un hermano mayor que lo escuchaba más o menos seguido y de todos sus discos ese era que el que más me gustaba. Cuando mi hermano entro a la universidad se tuvo que ir a vivir a otra casa y obvio se llevo todos sus discos debo decir que extrañe escucharlo.\n\nPara finales de los 80’s cuando tenía entre 14 y 15 años en México apenas comenzaba la transición de los discos de Vinyl a CD, en mi casa se adquirió un flamante nuevo estéreo con reproductor de discos compactos, otro de mis hermanos (supongo que también influenciado por mi hermano mayor) inmediatamente compro el disco compacto The Dark Side of The Moon, el escucharlo nuevamente realmente me conmovió, ahí estaban otra vez esos sonidos que identifique en mi niñez y no solo eso realmente pude detectar muchos más, pensé: “Estos tipos sí que le sacan jugo al sonido cuadrafónico” en esta etapa sobre todo me encantaba escuchar “On the Run” y “Any Color You Like” dos de las instrumentales del disco y donde destaca los efectos de con el sintetizador, pensaba “Demonios, ¿por qué en la actualidad nadie hace algo así con los sintetizadores ? ” y es que cualquier canción ochentera que utilizaba sintetizador (que eran bastantes) sonaba ridícula al compararla con cualquiera de estas dos.\n\nYa en el CCH entre la edad de 17 y 18 años y con el pretexto de traducir canciones para la clase de Inglés, se me ocurrió la idea de proponer las canciones del álbum The Dark Side of The Moon para la clase, en ese momento me di cuenta que nunca me había preocupado por entender el contenido de las letras del disco pensé “Y si las letras son un fiasco…”. El miedo al ridículo no solo me hizo buscar las mejores traducciones, sino a investigar más sobre el disco y lo que sus autores propusieron al sacarlo, así fue como me entere de que era un disco conceptual que trataba sobre diferentes aspectos de la vida misma y como nos afectan; desde el nacimiento, las presiones y miedos, los efectos del tiempo, el dinero, las relaciones personales y que al final te puede llevar a la locura y finalmente la inevitable muerte, la verdad a mi me gusto bastante toda la idea, la letras en general van al punto de cada uno de los temas que van tratando, así; en “Breath” se expone las alegorías que se nos dicen en la niñez sobre la vida, en Time se muestra cómo podemos desperdiciar el tiempo en cosas vánales, en Money se evidencia de forma irónica la avaricia y el consumismo , en “Us and Them” se valen del uso de dicotomías para describir diferentes situaciones, en “Brian Damage” se habla de la locura resultante de poner fama y éxito por encima de lo primordial y en “Eclipse” se invita a la reflexión repasando todos los aspectos importantes que se presentan en la vida de alguien (amor, sentidos, creaciones, visiones…etc.). En mi muy particular punto de vista las letras de este disco no serian tan protagónicas y pretenciosas como en los trabajos posteriores de la banda. Aunque la presentación de algunas de las letras en mi clase de Inglés realmente no fueron relevantes excepto para mí, ya con todo lo investigado, en esta está etapa escuchaba mas; “Speak to Me/Breath”, “Time/ Breath Reprise”, “Us and Them” , “Brian Damage/Eclipse” y de hecho puedo decir que junto con “The Great Jig In The Sky” hasta la fecha, estas cinco canciones entran dentro de las primeras 15 favoritas que tengo de la banda (considero “Speak to Me/Breath” y “Brian Damage/Eclipse” ambas como una sola canción ), pero mejor vayamos al análisis de cada una de ellas.\n\nReseña.\n\nEl Disco abre con Speak To Me que comienza con el sonido del Tambor de Nick Mason simulando los latidos del corazón, posteriormente aparecen sonidos que vendrán en las canciones siguientes, así tenemos; el sonido de un reloj , cajas registradoras, voces, risas demenciales y finalmente el sonido de un helicóptero y que supongo advierten sobre todo lo que le espera al nuevo sujeto que esta por nacer, en medio de estos sonidos súbitamente se escucha un grito de mujer (Clare Torry) acompañada de los platillos de Mason elevando la tensión al máximo que indica la etapa del nacimiento (que siempre es caótico), en este momento se enlaza con Breath In The Air que inicia con una melodía deliciosa y muy tranquila que se me figura a una banda de jazz tocando libremente contrastando con el final de Speak To Me y que representa a la niñez, esos primeros años de paz y tranquilidad, destacan los slides largos de David Gilmour de forma muy atmosférica y espacial y el seguimiento de Bajo de Roger Waters así como la batería de Nick Mason en toda la canción, la letra (que cantan a duo David y Roger) un poco metafórica expresa un poco en forma de consejo lo que le espera en la vida a ese pequeño que comienza, en fin ,las dos canciones son una introducción grandiosa mi calificación es: ★★★★★.(No fue sencillo oficial pero los fans y la banda la convertirían en clásico ✔sobre todo fue retomada por Gilmour en la etapa en que el tomo el control de la banda).\n\nSigue sin pausa la instrumental On The Run para muchos detractores de lo más flojo en el disco para mí no lo es en absoluto ya que se presenta un manejo muy completo y complejo del sintetizador con arpegiado-res por parte de Richard Wright, Roger Waters y David Gilmour y sobre todo de la mezcla de sonidos por parte de Waters; solo Nick Mason va acompañando con los platillos durante toda la canción dando la impresión como que se está en una carrera, aparecen luego voces como de una sala de espera así como de pasos de alguien que se acerca y se aleja muy de prisa, los sonidos del sintetizador que se nos presenta a veces suenan asfixiantes cargados de angustia y desesperación, posteriormente se escucha una voz diciendo una frase y luego ofreciendo una risa sarcástica para volver de nuevo a los sonidos sintetizados en esta ocasión se escucha como el rechinido de una puerta metálica muy vieja, luego aparecen sonidos como de aspas y de nuevo la risa sarcástica, ya para el final se escucha el sonido como de una hélice de un helicóptero y finalmente una explosión. Aunque no se tiene letra algunos suponen que lo que se trata de expresar aquí son las prisas y el estrés de la vida moderna que prácticamente nos llevan al límite de nuestras fuerzas; Otra interpretación y que en lo personal me gusta más a mí, es que se trata de representar la etapa de la adolescencia en donde los cambios son rápidos y abruptos y que nos llenan de angustia y tensión y que finalmente acaban por dejarnos como adultos sin realmente saber cómo o porque. Sea cual fuera la intensión el resultado fue sorprendente por lo que le doy un: ★★★★★.\n\nLigado a la anterior comienza Time uno de los grandes temas del disco (de Pink Floyd y uno de mis favoritos de todos los tiempos), comienza con el sonido de tic tac de varios relojes que de manera abrupta suenan sus campanas indicando que se cumplió una nueva hora (esto puede sobresaltar a más de uno), posteriormente se queda un solo tic tac realizado con el Tambor de Nick Mason, marcando el ritmo para dar paso a notas solas del bajo de Roger Waters simulando una campanada muy grave la cual suena ciertamente bastante misteriosa, esta nota se repite de forma constante, al mismo tiempo comienzan por una lado sonidos de tambores por parte de Mason y por otro lado sonidos de órgano un tanto lejanos por parte de Richard Wright, estos sonidos van aumentando incrementando la tensión hasta que finalmente se escucha la batería de Mason indicando a David Gilmour que inicie con la interpretación vocal, la verdad una introducción magistral de esas que erizan la piel. Las letras de la canción van directo al tema del tiempo y como en la juventud lo desperdiciamos, la letra dice: “Tu esperas y malgastas las horas que vienen y van caminando sobre tu pedazo de suelo en tu pueblo esperando por alguien o algo que te muestre el camino” continua la siguiente estrofa de la letra en esta ocasión cantada por Wright dándole un tono más suave y pasivo, se repite la idea del desperdicio del tiempo en la juventud pero al final cambia por la del ser consciente de ese desperdicio cuando ya es demasiado tarde: “Y entonces un día te encuentras que diez años han pasado detrás de ti. Nadie te dijo cuando arrancar te perdiste el disparo inicial…” mientras Wright canta esta parte se escuchan unos coros interpretados por Clare Torry que elevan la tensión de forma magistral. De allí comienza un solo de guitarra excepcional por parte de Gilmour, permitiendo que se eleve el nivel del tema, el solo se prolonga por casi un minuto (quizás solamente el solo de guitarra de Confortably Numb sea superior a este), el seguimiento de bajo de Waters y de Batería de Mason le dan un soporte muy bueno a toda la canción, vuelven aparecer los coros de Clare Torry esta vez un poco más discretos, para dar paso a la siguiente estrofa de la letra que también canta Gilmour y en la cual se expresa la desesperación de querer hacer algo ya en la edad adulta cuando ya no hay tiempo pues la muerte está cerca: “El sol es el mismo en forma relativa, pero tú eres más viejo con la respiración más corta y un día más cerca de la muerte”. Para la parte final nuevamente vuelve a cantar Wright redondeando la idea de que en la vejez ya no hay tiempo y solo queda esperar: “Cada año se hace más corto, parece nunca encontrarse más tiempo planes que se volvieron nada o medias paginas de líneas al azar esperando en una quieta desesperación es el estilo inglés…” de forma irónica la última estrofa de la letra nos indica que el tiempo de la canción está por terminarse: “El tiempo se fue, la canción termino, aunque yo quisiera decir algo mas..”, en esta parte al igual que en la anterior en donde canta Wright se hacen presente de forma fantástica los coros por parte de Clare Torry, en ese momento cuando la canción parece terminar hay un reprise hacia “Breath” de la mano del bajo de Waters nos trasporta nuevamente a esa canción (con los mismos arreglos de guitarra, batería y piano) solo que en esta ocasión solo canta él, la letra hace alegoría a lo placentero que es estar en casa mientras a lo lejos se escuchan las campanas que llaman a los fieles. Este reprise se puede interpretar como un respiro después de todo lo planteado con lo referente al tiempo o quizás la formación de un hogar por la referencia a las campanas de iglesia, es fin un epilogo muy bueno para culminar con toda esta joya musical. No lo puedo negar mi favorita de Pink Floyd de todos los tiempos, en donde todos los miembros de la banda muestran el tope de conjunción y de creatividad. Mi Calificación sin dudarlo es un ★★★★★. (Todo un Clásico ✔)\n\nLigada a Time viene otra instrumental que cierra la cara A del disco y es The Great Jig In The Sky una balada hermosísima en el que destaca la interpretación vocal de Clare Torry. Comienza con una melodía muy suave de piano por parte de Richard Wright acompañada por uno arreglos de guitarra que son slides muy largos por parte de David Gilmour, súbitamente se escucha una persona que dice: “No tengo miedo a morir, en algún momento pasará, no importa. Porque debería temerle a morir? no hay razón para ello, tú te tienes que ir en algún momento…” la guitarra y el piano va subiendo de tono y un redoble de batería por parte de Nick Mason da la pauta para que comience la interpretación vocal de Clare Torry, no canta ninguna letra simplemente se dedico a modular su voz, según se cuenta aparentemente lo único que le dijeron los Floyd fue: “haz lo que quieras” y el resultado fue asombroso, de hecho me atrevo a decir que es uno de los más grandes solos vocales jamás grabado para una música que no es clásica, en esta primera parte tenemos varios clímax frenéticos por parte de Torry en donde destaca el seguimiento que se le da con el órgano, batería y bajo. Súbitamente la voz de Torry se apaga junto con la de los demás instrumentos y solo queda el piano de Wright interpretando la melodía inicial; solo es un respiro pues Torry comienza nuevamente pero en esta ocasión más tranquila y pausada como tratando de seguir las notas de piano con su voz, para después tener nuevamente una serie de clímax que ciertamente no son tan intensos como los de la primera parte pero si están cargados de sentimiento, el piano y la voz de Torry continúan así hasta el final de la pieza. Posiblemente sea el tema más alejado del concepto del álbum pues al no tener letra y aparentemente sufrir muchísimos cambios ya que originalmente incluía la lectura de Efesios y un recital de la oración al Señor, lo logrado por Torry sugiere para muchos incluso la representación del acto sexual o por lo menos muchos la consideran uno de los mejores temas de fondo para hacer el amor (según las encuestas) otros piensan que el tema que se trata aquí es la muerte por la voz que se escucha dentro de la canción, algo que en lo personal me parece muy subjetivo, creo más bien que el contenido original que se quiso representar en esta pieza seguirá siendo un misterio (jajaja incluso para los mismos Floyd) y que en lo que si podemos estar de acuerdo es que Clare Torry quedo inmortalizada por su gran interpretación vocal. Mi calificación es de ★★★★★\n\nEl siguiente tema Money no está ligado a ninguno ya que abre la cara B del álbum y es sin duda un de los más famoso del mismo, en mi particular punto de vista es la otra joya contenida en el LP. Comienza con el sonido de cajas registradoras y el sonido de dinero proveniente de las mismas para dar paso al tremendo rif de bajo por parte de Roger Waters que va a dar de forma magistral el ritmo y soporte a toda la canción, pronto se incorporan la batería de Nick Mason acompañándolo y los rifs de guitarras de David Gilmour los cuales suenan increíbles por su efecto de eco aprovechando de manera magistral el tiempo de ¾ impuesto por el bajo de Waters otra introducción espectacular. Sentada la base musical del tema Gilmour comienza con la interpretación vocal con una letra cargada de ironía en lo referente a como gastamos el dinero en cosas vánales para satisfacer un ego desmedido. De vez en cuando siguen apareciendo el sonido de cajas registradoras así como los rifs metalizados de guitarra por parte de Gilmour, cuando termina la primera parte vocal comienza un solo monumental de saxofón interpretado por Dick Parry al cual se le dio libertad total y el cual se extiende por cerca de un minuto al finalizar esta primera parte del solo de saxofón se incorpora la batería de Mason incrementando la tensión y en un tris se cambia el tiempo de la canción para dar comienzo a unos solos de guitarra precisos por parte de Gilmour los cuales con el soporte de la batería de Mason se extienden por casi dos minutos nuevamente el bajo de Waters y los rifs de guitarra con eco de Gilmour cambian de forma precisa nuevamente el tiempo de la canción para dar paso a la siguiente parte vocal de la canción que continua con su mofa de la avaricia y consumismo que crea el exceso de dinero. Para finalizar hay un fade out de la canción y se escuchan algunas voces entre las frases que se alcanza a distinguir “Absolutamente tenia la razón… Si absolutamente tenia la razón…Ciertamente yo tenía la razón…” y “no lo sé, estaba realmente borracho en ese momento” y se escucha de forma lejana notas de un órgano que indica la introducción de la siguiente canción. En fin el contrapeso perfecto para el otro gran tema del disco mi calificación es de: ★★★★★ (el otro gran clásico del álbum ✔)\n\nEl siguiente tema que si está ligado al anterior y es Us and Them comienza con el sonido de un órgano distante que pronto va ganando terreno interpretado por Richard Wright, se incorporan de forma tranquila la batería y los demás instrumentos para dar forma nuevamente a una melodía muy tranquila y con estilo jazzistico. Acompañando a la melodía el saxofón de Dick Perry hace su aparición con una suavidad y cadencias exquisitas, el solo de sax se prolonga por casi ½ minuto, otra introducción grandiosa. Cuando termina el saxofón da inicio la parte vocal con una dicotomía en la cual cada una de sus partes se le agrega el efecto de eco, esta es una constante que se repite en el inicio de cada una de las frases de la canción (el comenzar con una dicotomía). Debido a que la letra abarca varios temas se presta para diferentes interpretaciones; Así por ejemplo a quienes afirma que de lo que trata la canción es de la guerra, otros aseguran que de lo que trata es de las relaciones personales, otros de los problemas a los que nos enfrentamos día con día…etc. En fin puede que tengan razón y a la vez no, pues el afirmar que la canción hable de un solo tema especifico, es muy subjetivo, tal vez de lo único que podemos afirmar es que por el uso de las dicotomías lo importante no es que tanto que nos separemos o dividamos al final tenemos un comienzo común y un destino que cumplir…Así las primeras frases nos dicen: “Nosotros y Ellos… y después de todo solo somos hombres comunes y corrientes” y “Yo y Tú… Dios solo sabe que no es lo que elegiríamos hacer”, después el sax, la batería y el piano incrementan la tensión para dar paso al primer climax de la canción en donde David Gilmour canta un hecho muy concreto que efectivamente tiene que ver con la guerra: “Avancen grita el de atrás y el viejo de adelante murió…” y “El general sentado, y las líneas en el mapa se mueven de lado a lado” los coros de Clare Torry y el piano de Wright aparecen acompañando esta parte que súbitamente termina para dar paso a la tranquila melodía inicial y Dave regresa nuevamente a las dicotomías: “Negro y Azul… Y quien sabe cuál es cual y quien es quien” y “Arriba y Abajo… Y al final solo es vuelta y vuelta y vuelta” de nueva cuenta la tensión se incrementa de mano del sax, piano, batería y con los coros de Torry para que Dave cante otro hecho concreto: “¿No has escuchado?, es una batalla de palabras, el hombre con el aviso gritó... Escucha hijo, dijo el hombre con la pistola hay espacio para ti adentro.” Después viene un solo refrescante de piano y se escuchan una conversación al parecer de un altercado cuando esta termina comienza un exquisito solo de saxofón que da paso al tercer climax de la canción, en esta ocasión nadie canta solo se incrementa la tensión con el órgano por supuesto con el sax, los platillos de Mason y los coros magistrales de Clare Torry. Entramos ya a la última parte de la canción en donde se retorna a la melodía inicial y Dave canta las últimas dicotomías: “Abajo y Afuera… No lo puedo evitar pero hay mucho acerca de eso” y “Con, Sin… y quien puede negar que de eso se tratan todas las peleas” la canción culmina con el último climax de mano del sax, la batería, los coros de Torry y Dave cantando hechos específicos: “Sal de mi camino, es un día ocupado y tengo cosas en mi mente” y “por lo que cuesta un té y un rodaja el viejo murió”, el hecho de que la canción acabe en un climax a mi forma de ver es lo que le resta puntos y la hace quedar solo un poquito por debajo de Time y Money, sin embargo, no culpo a los que piensan que es la mejor canción del disco pues tiene momentos increíbles, mi calificación es: ★★★★★.(También un gran clásico indiscutible ✔)\n\nDespués viene otra instrumental Any Color You Like que comienza aprovechando el final desbordante de la anterior con solos de órgano muy marcados por parte de Richard Wright y con los demás instrumentos a un buen ritmo dándole un buen soporte a la canción sobresaliendo la batería de Nick Mason y el Bajo de Roger Waters, los solos de órgano se prolongan por casi un minuto para después dar paso a la guitarra de David Gilmour que suena metalizada tratando de dar seguimiento a lo presentado en un principio por el órgano, nuevamente la batería (en esta ocasión mas con platillos) y el bajo le dan un buen soporte a los solos de guitarra de Gilmour que se prolongan por cerca de un minuto en la parte final nuevamente hace su aparición el órgano y entra en una especie de lucha con la guitarra de Dave, los demás instrumentos le siguen dando un buen soporte a la canción que se asemeja más a una improvisación de jazz, esta última parte se prolonga por casi otro minuto finalmente de la mano de la guitarra de Dave se da conclusión a la canción y se liga al siguiente tema y de hecho contrastando todo lo anterior presentado en el álbum debido a que en este tema no se tiene una gran producción ni tampoco una gran cantidad de efectos y sin embargo, la forma en que fue mezclada (Terry Thomas y Alan Parsons) la convierten en la pieza que faltaba para los detractores que sostienen que la improvisación y el sonido de la banda no se encuentra presentes en el álbum y sin embargo en este corte está muy presente y además suena muy integrado al sonido del disco. Quisa más difícil sea darle una interpretación debido a que los Floyd no mencionan algo en particular pero me gusta pensar que esta canción representa la edad adulta o de madurez Calificación ★★★★★ (Fue la cara B que acompaño a Time como sencillos ✔)\n\nLlega así la parte final del LP con dos temas que yo recomiendo escuchar siempre unidos: Brian Damage/Eclipse, comienzan con una guitarra tranquila pero muy rítmica por parte de Waters, así como unos slides largos de otra guitarra de Gilmour que se escuchan lejanos y los platillos de Mason apenas perceptibles que van dando seguimiento al tema, de esta forma Waters comienza a cantar en un tono tranquilo: “El lunático esta en el césped, El lunático está en el césped… El lunático está en mi sala los lunáticos están en mi sala…” Waters continua cantando y posteriormente se escucha un órgano seguido de un remate de batearía elevando el tono del tema, Waters comienza a cantar nuevamente de forma un poco más grave, se escucha el acompañamiento del órgano nuevamente y la voz de Clare Torry en los coros elevando la tensión de forma genial, presagiando un primer climax de la canción, Waters finaliza con las siguientes estrofas: “Y si tu cabeza explota también con oscuros presagios Nos veremos en el lado oculto de la luna.” Dando paso nuevamente al órgano y los coros de Clare Torry de forma sensacional hasta llegar nuevamente al tema minimalista del inicio, aquí Waters comienza a cantar nuevamente de forma b suave “El lunático está esta en tu cabeza, El lunático está en tu cabeza” repitiéndose nuevamente la parte de elevar la tensión y teniendo un segundo climax del tema que termina con las siguientes frases “Y si la banda en la que estás comienza a tocar diferentes melodías. Nos veremos en el lado oculto de la luna.” Después de este según climax del tema se escucha nuevamente el órgano de forma más pausada mientras al mismo tiempo de que se escuchan unas palabas de dicen “Yo no puedo pensar otra cosa que decir excepto...Pienso que es maravilloso” culminando con una risa entre demencial e incoherente. En general podría decirse que el tema principal que se trata aquí es el estado de locura de una persona e incluso se hace referencia directamente a Syd Barret (en la parte de la letra del final del segundo climax) de cuando tocaba de forma discordante en sus últimos momentos con la banda precisamente por el estado demencial que comenzaba afectarlo. El cambio en el tono del órgano con un solo muy psicodélico y un remate de batería de Mason indican casi de forma imperceptible que ya estamos en el tema de Eclipse casi inmediatamente Waters comienza nuevamente a cantar enumerando en forma de lista una serie acciones generales que un ser humano realiza durante su vida, quizás el preludio de que la misma está por terminarse y se hace un recuento de todo lo que se vivió, mientras continua cantando los Coros de Clare Torry se hacen presente así como el seguimiento de batería de Mason incrementando la tensión de forma significativa presagiando el final de la canción y el del disco, Waters termina con la siguientes frases “Todo lo que hay ahora. Todo lo que se ha ido. Todo lo que vendrá y todo cuanto bajo el sol hay, está en armonía pero el sol está eclipsado por la luna.” Al final se escucha nuevamente la batería de Mason simulando los latidos del corazón en esta ocasión indicando que una vida se apaga hasta quedar completamente en silencio. De esta forma se redondea la idea de que el disco en su contexto general trata todos los aspectos de la vida del ser humano desde su nacimiento hasta la muerte. Las últimas frases con las que termina el disco de que todo bajo el sol es armonía pero al final es eclipsado por la luna y la frase con la que se termina el primer climax de Brian Damage de que nos veremos en el lado obscuro de la luna pareciera que indica que al morir todos terminamos en una especie de locura y eso es lo que los Floyd llaman el lado obscuro de la luna, aunque esto es muy subjetivo y es solo una de las múltiples interpretaciones que se pueden llegar a dar, lo rescatable a mi parecer de estos últimos temas son que al final para este epilogo lo importante no fue el tener un tema con grandes solos de guitarra o llenos de efectos si no algo más sencillo en donde destacará sobre todo la letra, es lo que redondea y hace esta sea un último mosaico de este gran disco. Mi calificación es de ★★★★★. (Tampoco fue sencillo oficial pero los fans la convertirían en clásico ✔sobre todo fue retomada por Waters en sus giras como solista).\n\nEpilogo.\n\nSe cuentan muchas historias sobre este disco que si llegaba adquirir solo para probar los equipos de sonido por la cantidad de efectos que contenía, otra de igual manera que si traía mensajes ocultos, esto por la cantidad de voces grabadas, el hecho es y sigue siendo el disco más vendido de la banda, posiblemente para muchos amantes del Rock progresivo este disco no lo sea y puede que tengan razón ya que me parece que es el disco está más cargado hacia el rock psicodélico y a el pop-art rock, para mí este aspecto es un plus en lugar de un contra ya que este disco es mucho más fácil de escuchar que trabajos posteriores de la banda, que si son reconocidos por trabajos netamente progresivos pero no tan fáciles de entender y de escuchar por otra parte se me hace un trabajo que sirve como introducción a la música de la banda , ya que al menos contiene 3 de las canciones dentro del top 10 de la banda (para mí son 6 temas que si no están dentro del Top 10 si dentro del Top 15: “Time”, “Money”,” Speak to Me/Breath” , “The Great Jig In The Sky”, “Us and Them” y “Brian Damage/Eclipse”), el hecho de ser un álbum conceptual pero que sus canciones se pueden escuchar por separado es otro punto a favor. Se suele exagerar de que el disco está sobre valorado y sobre producido y esta aspecto se suele manejar como si Pink Floyd lo hubiera hecho a propósito solo para ganar fama e impresionar, el hecho es que al contrario habría que felicitar a Alan Parsons por el gran trabajo de producción que se realizo para este LP, y sobre todo por el excelente trabajo que realizo con las colaboraciones de Dick Parry con el Saxofón que le da un aire increíblemente fresco a la música de los Floyd y sobre todo la incursión de la voz de Clare Torry en el sonido de prácticamente todo el disco de forma tan especial que prácticamente se inmortalizo y se quedo como una de las grandes joyas en el sonido del álbum y que fue algo tan importante que en las giras de la banda en vivo posteriores a este lanzamiento siempre se tendría que contar con un coro de al menos tres cantantes femeninas para tratar de igualar lo reflejado en el estudio.\n\nSe suele decir tan bien que el disco influiría de forma negativa en el mercado y que a partir de la salida de este álbum el rock se volvió más un lujo que algo alcanzable y que al final desencadenaría el punk como respuesta, algo que también es sumamente exagerado ya que prácticamente desde finales de la década de los 60’s grupos como The Kinks o de The Who tratarían de realizar cosas más elaboradas (Con Tommy prácticamente se inauguraría la salida de los álbumes conceptuales en el rock) incluso grupos que un inicio se pueden considerar como pop-rock como los The Beatles (que lanzarían lp’s como Revolver y el Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) y los The Beach Boys (que lanzaría Pet Sounds) editarían álbum cada vez más elaborados musicalmente hablando, así mismo el lanzamiento del primer LP de King Crimson (este si un trabajo totalmente progresivo) junto con el lanzamiento del álbum Close to the Edgede Yes indicaría más bien que era una tendencia y que no solo un grupo o un LP estaba inmerso si no era todo un movimiento que de hecho terminaría en una especie de boom de grupos progresivos no solo ingleses (Yes, Camel, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Genesis, ) si no de otras partes de Europa (Italia: Premiata Forneria Marconi, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Area, Francia: Harmonium, Gong, Alemania: Nektar…etc) incluso grupos más orientados al Blues y al folk como Jethro Tull terminarían realizando un lp progresivo (Thick as a Brick [25th Anniversary Edition] de 1972). Muy posiblemente si el Dark Side of the Moon no hubiera existido algún otro álbum de los grupos de esta etapa clásica del Rock Progresivo hubiera tomado su lugar, lo que es irónico es que el Dark Side es como ya lo comente quizás el disco más alejado del progresivo de los que editaría la banda en la década de los 70’s, quizás esto es lo que lo hace más universal y por lo tanto más escuchado es uno de esos accidentes geniales que a veces juega el destino.\n\nAunque a partir de este LP Roger Waters tomaría el control de las letras de las canciones de la banda prácticamente hasta su salida de la misma, para la parte musical lo que se nota es que si hay un espíritu de colaboración y de equipo durante la grabación del mismo o bueno eso es lo que se alcanza a notar en el documental Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii además de constatar el estupendo momento por el que pasaban todos los integrantes de la banda ya que las interpretaciones que realizan de temas clásicos sobre todo de Meddle son soberbias. En una entrevista acerca del disco Richard Wright comentaría que una vez que habían concluido la grabación el sentimiento que tenia (y al parecer el de todos los miembros de la banda) era simplemente que habían realizado un buen trabajo. “Al final sabíamos que habíamos hecho un bueno trabajo” lo que paso después con el disco de que si se convirtió o no en un icono del rock…etc, sale sobrando y a mi forma de ver los Floyd no tienen la culpa, por lo cual lo que yo puedo decir es que lo que queda es escucharlo sin duda de principio a fin.""]",5.00 stars

Zephos,"['So being as this is the most famous concept album that is actually a concept album, ever....I think kids it\'s definitely time to talk about what makes a good concept album. First things first, don\'t actually try and make it a taught narrative, unless you are really specifically good at that? Like an ace musical writer? That almost never really works as well as you would want it too. Second, keep it vague, this goes in line with the first. By vague I mean like the lyrics and so forth, you can have a really focused idea but let that be something that can be made felt through the music y\'know? Heavy concept albums often make or break on that principal. What are some successful concept albums? Wish You Were Here instantly leaps to mind! I\'ll save the why to that review itself, but it has a lot to do with Number Two. Bowie\'s Low is HALF concept album, and a really wonderful one. First half we get bombarded with German style rock music before we get a section of instrumental photojournalism of various East Bloc sites. No simpler a concept than ""East Bloc"", and that carries beautifully into Bowie\'s soundscapes. Zen Arcade is a great concept album! We get a narrative, but with little to no real attempt made at making it into any kind of heavy script. There\'s a super vague arc that follows more on emotion than event, which shocker surprise wowser, works better in music form. Fear of Music rules too, a journey through a mental ward of comical severe anxiety. So that brings me of course to Dark Side of the Moon. It\'s a conceptual concept album, not a narrative one. So good good on that account. And I definitely have to applaud the band for realizing they needed focus for their music, something the last three albums have all badly lacked. But their idea of focus is hardly fully realized, basically they shoot so damn wide here that they were bound to not fully satisfy. The idea...if you can call something so broad a single idea...is to capture various stressful themes into songs. Money, time, dying, racism (I think?) etc. Who would have guessed that this doesn\'t exactly tie together particularly well? I listen to these songs, particularly the first side and just don\'t hear it. There\'s not a ton of musical variation going on either aside from Time\'s chiming clocks and the entirity of On The Run. Most of it is a strange sort of bluesy even soul vibed prog guitar work out. Sort of muddy and English too of course. Musically it\'s pretty great, in a way it\'s a big damn deal because we\'re hearing Pink Floyd mach 2 just kind of play music for the first time. After three albums of wasting our time isn\'t that nice? While still not the most invigorating thing on earth, Pink Floyd does have a way with sluggish dramatics. Slow moving songs that don\'t have much in the way of chutzpah. I like that stuff on here! Honest! Tracks like Brain Damage, Money, The Great Gig are all good stuff. I still kind of roll my eyes at their vocal recordings and sound effects, but whatever it\'s cool. So why is this so damn beloved?? I have to think it\'s because it\'s most peoples first encounter with music like this, with concept albums. That\'s my best guess, when they\'re young no less. I don\'t think it holds up much, it\'s just pretty neat as is.\n\nRating: 4\nHighlights: On the Run, Money, Any Color You Like, Brain Damage']",4.00 stars

beatlespock,"['PUES SÍ, ¡EL DISCO ES CONDENADAMENTE BUENO!\n\nNo sé cuántos años en listas, récord de cabecera del hitparade de LPs, ríos de tinta vertidos acerca de la supuesta obra magna de los Floyd y hasta ese dichoso prisma diseñado por Hipnosis me hicieron suponer que ""Dark side of the moon"" iba a ser el mejor disco que hubiese tenido oportunidad de escuchar hasta la época, ese año 1993 en los que mis cimientos musicales se estaban afianzando a base de meros rascados sobre la superficie del inmenso planeta rock.\n\nNada más lejos de la realidad. El Cd, adquirido en una tienda de discos de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria al lado de la Avenida Mesa y López, que ofertaba una especie de ""compre 10 y le regalamos 1"", me dejó frío a la primera escucha. Pocos ganchos musicales, muchos aparatitos sonoros, y encima ese pasmoso e inconfundible single llevado a base de caja registradora machacona ""Money"" no me gustaba mucho. ""Dark side"" pasó a formar parte de mis fiascos musicales primitivos y quedó arrinconado en el baúl del olvido hasta que, un par de años más tarde, me compré el sucesor ""Wish you were here"", que me encantó. Por inercia, decidí rescatar la obra magna y ¡albricias! ¡Qué disco tan bueno! ¿Cómo no me había dado cuenta antes?\n\nEs lo que tienen Waters, Gilmour y compañía. Se resisten, se hacen querer con dificultades, te meten trampas en todas partes para que mandes sus discos al fondo de las estanterías, pero entonces pasa un milagro y te conviertes. Todo encaja. El pulso. Los gritos. Las risas del colocón. Los relojes. El homenaje a ""Dear Prudence"". En resumen, qué pedazo de disco, la bisagra de unión entre la música que el mismo Syd Barret consideraba anticuada y las locuras de ""Animals"" y ""The Wall"". Particularmente, creo que ""Wish you were here"" es más íntimo y resume lo mejor de la esencia del grupo, pero no cabe duda que ""Dark side of the moon"" fue capaz de trascender una época entera y gustar a casi todos los consumidores de los más variados estilos de música.\n\nMis tres momentos estelares del disco:\n\n1) ""The great gig in the sky"". Alaridos desaforados de Clare Torry (en el momento y lugar adecuados, Abbey Road Studios) al servicio de la causa. No hay letra. Ni falta que hace. Como en el instrumental caleidoscópico ""Any colour you like"".\n\n2) Uno de los solos de guitarra más bonitos de la historia del rock lo encontraremos en ""Money"". Gilmour muestra su maestría en todo su esplendor. Consigue hasta olvidar momentáneamente el truquito de la registradora.\n\n3) El clímax de ""Brain damage"", un homenaje claro a la beatleiana ""Dear Prudence"". Vuelven a aparecer las risas por doquier, pero el tema no es precisamente alegre, ya que el demente Syd Barret es protagonista. Ese Syd, que volvería dos años a una sesión de ""Wish you were here"" para constatar en un momento de lucidez lejana que el grupo no tenía nada que ver con sus inicios lisérgicos.']",4.50 stars

SgtPetsounds,"[""Pink Floyd was the first band that I was ever obsessed with when I was younger and this is the album that started it all. A couple days after my 16th birthday (just under 4 years ago now) I bought it with some of my birthday money. It was the first CD I bought, before that the only CDs I owned were top 40 compilations I got as birthday or Christmas presents from well-meaning but somewhat clueless relatives. I didn't listen to much music at the time and when I did it was mostly my dad's CDs. I guess this was the album that got me into music in general (for better or worse).\nAnyway the first couple of times I listened I wasn't very impressed, it was so unlike the pop songs I was used to listening to but about the third or fourth time something clicked and I finally “got it”. This was the best album I had heard up to that point so naturally I bought some of their other albums (eventually their entire discography), Pink Floyd led me to Led Zeppelin and Hendrix which eventually led me most of the artists I listen to now so I guess I owe this album a lot. That said, while I still like Pink Floyd I don't like them as much as I used to and I can't quite give this 5 stars, at least not while it's higher than Highway 61 and Sgt. Pepper.""]",4.50 stars

onura46,"[""Purely on a musical level Dark Side of the Moon is pretty much ten for ten. There's an unmistakable time and place to the recording but the songs themselves are accessible (and have been infinitely iterated) across cultures and genre. On a technical level there is innovation here rivaled only by a few lone auteurs - some in expensive studios, some in their bedrooms - and artists in further-flung krautrock spheres. The more you read about the history of the band, the recording of this album, and each creative mind invested in Pink Floyd, the more it becomes obvious that the success of Meddle and a truly post-Barrett band caused them to take it very seriously and act accordingly. Everyone - including engineer Chris Thomas and the three backup vocalists - was at the top of their game with a budget and toys fit to match. I don't know if Dark Side of the Moon is a perfect record, but it's so complete, so influential, so incredibly moving and artful that it's no surprise it retains its status over time. The only thing that drifts over time is this album's relatively mellow attitude versus the tides of the world.""]",4.50 stars

No_Others,"['Truthfully, I had never really sat down and listened to Dark Side of the Moon all the way through, so my familiarity with the content was somewhat limited. I always heard it was a classic, that it was innovative and wonderful to listen to. Once I sat down with the whole thing (not just ""Time""), I was not surprised at all that all those claims were quite true; the record doesn\'t disappoint at all.\n\nAlthough a diehard cynic could complain that the album is too...dull at moments, or whatever, most people would punch that person in the face, myself included. There are so many layers in this record that its difficult not to enjoy it, even if the tone of a particular song may be sadder or slower. Also, there is a good amount of variety, be it in subject matter, tempo, volume, or effects. One would be hard-pressed to find an individual who did not like this album at least a little.\n\nI reserve a rating of five stars only for classic albums such as this, but I didn\'t give this effort that score just because of it\'s status. Dark Side of the Moon really achieved that because of something very specific (and at a first glance, irrelevant): the mechanics on this CD are perfect. Mechanics meaning, flow and cohesion, along with putting a fresh twist on the psychedelia that was popular at the time. Each track segues seamlessly the entire way through the album, with no awkwardly misplaced sounds or abrupt stop-starts. In combination with the layered instruments and fine touches (like the spoken-word parts of ""Speak to Me/Breathe"", ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" and ""Us and Them"", the footsteps on ""On the Run"", clocks on ""Time"" and cash register on ""Money""), this recording takes the listener on a mental journey. It\'s an experience! Being able to take the listener on an adventure with the group\'s music is very rare, and that is what makes this work worthy of five stars.\n\nBut there are other praiseworthy things about this CD as well. For this record, Pink Floyd stuck with some of their favorite themes: mental illness (""Speak to Me"" and ""Brain Damage""), war (""Us and Them""), aging/death (""Time"" and ""The Great Gig in the Sky""), and greed (""Money""). Each of these are evenly spaced and unrepeated throughout the record, so even though they\'ve appeared in the group\'s material before, it doesn\'t feel overdone; it seems more like a trademark than a lack of ideas. That freshness could also be contributed to by the jazzy, classy instruments (badass guitars, twangy bass and moody keyboard).\n\nA small disappointment on this record is that it\'s only ten tracks long. But considering that each song averages four minutes in length, and that the whole CD flows effortlessly from one song to the next, as the listener you\'ll hardly notice. You\'ll observe instead the audio landscapes the songs create, the type of spacey focus that centers you in a sort of musical orbit in a very explosive, psychotic solar system. With a description that intense, the score speaks for itself.\n\nDownload this: ""Us and Them""']",5.00 stars

After all, there are as yet undiscovered Amazonian tribes who will own a copy of this!\nTimeless and classic? Yes now but at the time, not so! After discovering Floyd in around 1971 with the Relics collection I had grown used to the psychedelic and spacey, experimental sound of the band. I can remember the first time I heard DSOTM in my mate\'s listening basement and being wholly underwhelmed. It sounded like a sell-out and in a way it was. Unbeknownst to me the band had intentionally gone for a more commercial sound, being bored with the trippy sound of their past. I was not on board with the new direction and couldn\'t listen to it for some years, still being tied in to the ""classic"" sound of the earlier period. I suppose it was not until 1982 that I tried listening to it again, when I bought the vinyl album. I found that I was now more attuned to the ideas and the simpler song structures and it became a favourite. I still prefer the Meddle era but not at the exclusion of this and WYWH.\n\nMastering / Sound Quality: This is very, very close in quality to my other CD, the 1984 version, which given its lineage is testimony to how good the earlier CD was. At that time CDs often were poorly mastered and mixed and chucked out willy-nilly to the unsuspecting public. Not so that one, as it turns out. This Sax remaster does add a little clarity and that\'s about all. The soundstage is comparable and the timbre of the instruments sounds natural. A good disc but so was the earlier one.

Album ten jest jednym z najlepiej sprzedających się albumów w historii przemysłu muzycznego (ponad 30 milionów egzemplarzy na całym świecie), a to dzięki doskonałemu zgraniu jego zawartości, muzycznie jak i tekstowo, oraz wysokiego wkładu wielu osób w ostateczny kształt dźwiękowy.

diego21,"['""I was really excited the first time that Pink Floyd made me feel out of this world, it was the first time i heard DSOTM"". That\'s how I started one of my first reviews back in 2007 when I had just joined this site. No doubt I was excited of having listened to this, and that probably took over my judgement and writing skills. Actually I still remember the ""out of world experience"", which may or may not have been intentionally induced. Well, anyways, I felt this album deserved a better review than the lousy one I had made years ago. Normally, before writing a review for an album, I tend to listen to it numerous times, even if I play it seldomly, I can still find new things. For Dark Side of the Moon I didn\'t need to follow this procedure, the album itself is probably already on my DNA patterns, somewhere over there it is, because if I were on a desolate isle in the middle of the sea, I could still close my eyes, press play on my brain, and I\'ll hear every beat, every riff, and every ""if you hear this than you\'re dying"" (yep, I know it doesn\'t say that, but my friends keep repeating it does).\n\nFor me, this is the perfect album, and nothing will ever be able to surpass it. For many people, it also ranks among their top albums, and the reason is simple, 1973 was a year of great inspirations for the musicians which make up this band, Roger Waters specially, and producer Alan Parsons. From the moment Speak to me/Breathe starts, and you can listen to little excerpts of the samples used throughout the album, taking you on a hyperspace travel in On the Run, to my favorite track on the album, Time, which is an excellent soft song with an equally great solo, and which leaves you thinking ""I won\'t be younger next time I listen to this"". The Great Gig in the Sky takes you up to heaven with the great vocal solo by Clare Torry. Money, I am afraid has been a little bit too overplayed as a single, but once you listen to this album as a whole (the way it is meant to), it is another epic track. Us and Them is another of my favorite tracks on the album, slow and beautiful creation of Richard Wright, which was once rejected to be used in the movie Zabriskie Point. I once heard Any Colour You Like be called filler, I\'ll probably punch that person if could remember who it was (well, if he/she said it once more), because without that wonderful instrumental piece, the album would break down. The final two tracks, where the band pays tribute to Syd Barret, and his fall to insanity, are just as good, with Eclipse being the cap which closes a pefect muscial experience.\n\nAnd even though, I like exploring new stuff every day, and I don\'t actually listen that oftenly nowadays to my favorite album, it will continue being so, and I will never be unwilling to listen to this album. If I knew when the end of the world would be, I would listen to this one last time. You\'re free to disagree with me, of course.']",5.00 stars

The band took all-too-familiar lyrical topics, solid production, eerie effects, outstanding guest performances, and, above all, visionary songcraft by Roger Waters, and tied it all together with their lush, atmospheric brand of space rock that they pioneered and became known for, and the end result was what many will argue to be the greatest rock album of all time. The songs are crafted very carefully to give the entire work an epic, near-operatic scope, turning every casual listen-through into an emotional experience. Not only does the album function perfectly as a whole, but it also has turned out just as well segmented into singles, spawning such classic rock hits as ""Money,"" ""Us and Them,"" and ""Time.""

TheArcadesOnFire,"['The year is 1973, Glam Rock was hitting it\'s peak, The Last Summer of Wine debuted, and the Miami Dolphins had their first (and likely last) perfect season topped off with a Super Bowl win. Now fresh off their soundtrack for La Vallée, and before their tour for their 1971 album Meddle, their bassist Roger Waters proposed that they worked on an album that dealt with things that made people mad, and showing the pressures of their lifestyle. This thought led to Pink Floyd ""The Dark Side Of The Moon"" which would eventually end up a cornerstone of Rock and is as mysterious and perplexing as the actual Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nPink Floyd was always an amazing band and they proved this before, but with this album they completely blew all expectations out of the water. Their sound had never sounded so flawless. The soundwriting and instrumentation is beautifully carried out and it has that spacey feeling. The tracks are well designed and atmospheric, the bells and alarms at the beginning of ""Time"" is artistic approach to kicking off the song and of course, everyone\'s favorite Any Colour You Like is here as well.

While I can\'t deny that Time, The Great Gig In The Sky and Money are absolute masterpieces, with what is probably one of the best solos ever (Money), the second side is relentlessly boring and predictable (with the exception of B1 and B5).\n\nThe album starts with three tracks of filler and just aimlessly wandering around, before going into full gear, and being amazing at it, for three tracks before going back to being filler and disturtbingly predictable. By the time the chorus in Us And Them comes in I wish I were listening to another album, and not Any Colour You Like nor Brain Damage can save the album from the huge wound Us And Them had left to be cured, Any Colour You Like sounding like one reprise too many of what is already a pretty mediocre theme. Not only Breathe is meh at best as a song, it also has to destroy the album by being it\'s theme! Brain Damage sounds like Pink Floyd had gone completely out of ideas by then, and follows the recognizable pattern of ""quiet verse, chorus with choir"" from both Time and Us And Them. And then it\'s ECLIPSE! A great way to finish an album, but it\'s too little, too late.\n\nAnd, after album ends, do I feel any different? No! I don\'t feel anything. I have no urge to go back to any track and listen to it again, and I don\'t feel anything for the whole either. Pink Floyd can do much better than this. WHAT\'S WITH ALL THE HYPE THIS ALBUM GETS?! I\'ve heard drone/doom songs with more content and emotion than this album! I\'ve heard Pink Floyd songs with more content and emotion than this album! This is just boring and predictable.

JohnnyPouffe,"['Это был самый первый альбом, который я когда-либо прослушал.

Не помню, какой мы до этого вели разговор, но он просто достал оттуда одну такую прозрачную, на которой была наклеена тонкая бумажная полоска с надписью ""The Dark Side Of the Moon"". Папа протянул мне кассету и сказал, чтобы я послушал. У меня тогда в комнате еще магнитофон стоял, с двумя кассетниками даже (к слову, коробка была не от этого магнитофона; тот, если не ошибаюсь, пришел в неисправность), ну я, разумеется, и вставил в один из них кассету. Не сказать, чтобы я испытал восторг от прослушивания или был под каким-то впечатлением. Нет-нет, не потому что мне не понравилось, а скорее потому, что мне попросту не было дано это сразу понять. Это ко мне не сразу пришло. Лишь со временем меня стали переполнять чувства восторга, восхищения от этого концерта.

SirPwn4lot,"[""'The Dark Side of the Moon' was where Pink Floyd really took off. Disheartened after the repeated failure to replicate the success of their debut album 'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn', which is considered one of the most influential albums of the rock era, the band condensed the wild musical soundscapes of 'Meddle' into actual listenable songs. It worked. 'The Dark Side of the Moon' was a massive international hit, and remains their best selling album, closely followed by 'The Wall'.\n\nBut where 'The Wall' manages to fail 'Dark Side' succeeds. This is an album's album; pure and simple. Previously Pink Floyd had centered on specific songs, neglecting the less popular songs of their albums in favor of the epic ones, but here Waters manages to raise the bare standard of songs to a point where they finally become commercially successful again. As a result there are very few songs on this album that aren't great, and those at the top have defined the progressive rock genre for decades, and hopefully for centuries to come.\n\nHighlights include the amazing guitar work by Gilmour, who sets the standard of what a solo really is. Song wise 'Time', 'Money', 'Breathe', 'The Great Gig in the Sky', 'Us and Them' and 'Any Color You Like' are the standouts, but the rest aren't far off. Also, the album art is instantly identifiable wherever you go, and is likely one of the best examples in popular music.\n\nWhile 'Wish You Were Here' is a better album 'The Dark Side of the Moon' manages to display a large variety of songs that will satisfy all musical tastes. If you're new to Pink Floyd this is where to start.""]",5.00 stars
Floydium,"['Soo Dark Side Of The Moon... it has certainly got its fair share of praise and criticism over the years since it\'s release all the way back in 73\'. Now forget about the fact that I rated the album 5 out of 5 because this review is going to be a little bit different... well I think so anyway. I\'m not going to sit here and tell you how I <3 the album and how I think the lyrics can be ""deep"" or how I have never listened to this album while high (I kindly reserve Echoes with 2001 for that thank you very much). I am, however, going to put this album in a different light, a light that could bring new found joy or horror to this album. I am talking about listening to this album as if it was a rock opera... yes a rock opera and I can prove it... seriously. This ""review"" of sorts will take you through my idea and reviewing it in that manner, thus making my review totally unique and totally freaking sweet.\n\nFirst things first Story; I\'m not going to tell you what the difference between a rock opera and a concept album is because I\'m guessing most of you know what they are. So here is the basic outline for the story of Dark Side:\n1, The heartbeats in Speak To Me are the birth of the main character (you can make up the characters name) who I will called Syd.\n2, Breathe is where our character takes first breathes in the real world... you robots.\n3, On The Run is the point at which our main character has grown up into a teenager and decides to run away from home. Is it to prove a point? is it cause of all that angsty teenager rage? honestly just make up your own idea.\n4, Time is were our main character finally stops running at which point he, or she, comes to the realization that time has passed them by. He/She watches as the world passes them by and that they have missed soo much of life... it\'s totally getting deep now.\n5, The Great Gig In The Sky is now the point were our character sits down and starts to wonder off into an otherworldy trancey... thingy. At the end the character comes to the conclusion that money is the only thing that matters.\n6, Leading on from mind opening realization and our character has started to aquire a large amount of wealth and thus leads them down the path of greed.\n7, Us And Them is showing the character that they really do need more than just money and that which the character needs is other people. However the wealth that has been built up has caused a massive gulf between our character and the rest of society.\n8, Nearly finished; Any Colour You Like is sort of like Great Gig, however it\'s more to do with the character being filled with self pity and hate. This slowly drives the character over the edge and into insanity.\n9, Brain Damage just speaks for itself but to give it more explaination think of the dark side of the moon as a safe place within our character\'s mind that he/she retreats into for safety.\n10, And Eclipse finished off the story with our character having their life flash before their eyes and finishes off, where we began, with the heartbeat.\n\nYes I know that is an extremely long way of putting the album into a story but it\'s always great to try and put a new spin on classic albums. Now for the actual review part and this is were I take my own story and critcise it for lack of explaination or I praise it... I\'m totally pretentious ya\' know. The biggest problem with looking at the album in this way is that most of the time you have to read between the lines and more or less make up bits off the story for it make sense. Take for example On The Run and were I cannot explain why the character is running away because it\'s simply never brought up in album. This basically leads onto the point that the album itself was never meant as a rock opera and so to look at it in this way takes alot of imagination or possibly drugs. Also the fact that we are never told about a character in the album can lead you to think ""why should I care about someone who we are never told about or who may not even exist?"". Honestly I don\'t know... but that hasn\'t stopped people in the past from making entire stories about people who may or may not exist and who you\'re never told to care about. I think the greatest characters are ones we make for our own and ones which we can put our own personal experiences on. These characters in a way can help us to realize things about ourselves that we didn\'t even think about to begin with. ""Wait!"" I hear a voice cry, ""What happened to this review?"" oh yeah that thing that I was kinda doing. To be serious it\'s hard to review something that you made up in under 5 or soo minutes on a subject that isn\'t even there and on a character that we\'re never told about. All I\'m really trying to say is that even if you hate or love this album then I suggest giving it another go but from a different listening perspective.\n\nTL;DR make up a story and have fun with the album.']",5.00 stars

This is genius. Time opens with a great drum intro before a great understated riff drives the song towards that classic solo....as Time fades out the vocal acrobatics begin on Great Gig, breathtaking.\n\nThe second side begins with the undanceable yet funky Money which again features a superb Gilmour solo. Us and Them is a tuneful and mellow Wright show peice with some great crescendoes, utilising Gilmopurs great melodic singing as opposed to Waters harsher tone.

Does it mean that Robert Johnson was a jerk who was just tinkling little lullabies on his battered acoustic guitars, and singing his songs to pass time while they harvested the cotton? Or does it mean that Bob Dylan was just a folk-singer? Or does it mean that all the krautrock bands were just plain losers doing whatever came to their head in the name of music?\n\nNo, art-rock precisely means ""artful-sounding rock music for the average listener whose priority otherwise is Fleetwood Mac or Aerosmith"". And in the case of Pink Floyd, it is just cashing in on the naive public. Yes, people, Pink Floyd are just average musicians wearing the garb of art-rockers.\n\nProgressive-rock\nThis one is a little more acceptable, because the band as such can be grouped with the likes of Yes, Genesis, Soft Machine, etc. because of the style of music they were making prior to this record. But to say this album is ""prog-rock"" is very inaccurate and almost laughable. As one reviewer says here, this album is supposedly a genius work because it applies only the right amount of experimentation to the otherwise banal and dispensable songwriting to pep it up for consumption for the people who will cherish that they are listening to ""prog-rock"".

TheDoctor394,"['I suppose I should write something on this one, since it\'s pretty much the Gone With The Wind of rock, meaning it\'s one you simply must hear if you\'re a real rock fan, but, more than that, you have to love it.\n\nMaybe ""love"" is not quite the word I\'d choose for The Dark Side Of The Moon, but ""admire"" and ""joy"" certainly are two of them, as I do see this as the classic it\'s reputed to be.\n\nI didn\'t really go for it at first. In fact, I fell asleep half way through my initial listen, waking up towards the end, which is maybe a reason why ""Eclipse"" is my favourite part of the record. Its rousing, repeated refrain came to me like a dream, and I wondered what I\'d been missing before. Now when I listen to it, I hear it as a wonderous, captivating conclusion to a memorable journey through greed, insanity, life, death... those are the primary topics here, aren\'t they?\n\nIt all comes together so wonderfully well, and sounds magical, but other highlights for me include some of the sound effects, like the cacophony of clocks on the first side, and the cash register stuff introducing the dynamic ""Money"" on the second, which also includes a terrific guitar solo. Then there\'s ""The Great Gig In The Sky"", which is dominated by Clare Terry\'s vocal wailings, something I should hate, but it just works with its emotional depth and feeling.\n\nThere\'s an atmosphere, a dreamlike quality to this album that is like nothing else I\'ve heard. I\'ll never be a huge Pink Floyd fan. Indeed, from the band\'s catalogue, in my view, only The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn comes close to matching this one. And the two are as different as chalk and cheese. But The Dark Side Of The Moon really is something special, and it proves that every time I sit down and listen to it.']",5.00 stars

notoriousERC,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Roger Waters said every previous album of their built up to this album so it should be no surprise it\'s their best yet. I wouldn\'t call it the climax as wish you were here (their next album) is my personal fav but they polished every element of theirs to a perfect shine. It\'s probably more space rock than any of their other albums and while I don\'t think it\'s that important there\'s something to be said about that. Not to mention David Gilmore\'s guitar playing has gotten even better\n\nAnother thing that makes this album historic, at least to me, is that this is one of the biggest growers I\'ve ever heard (second to good kid, maad city by Kendrick Lamar). It took 100+ listens to the song money (probably their best known and most radio played song) to realize just how intense that long guitar solo is. And the more I hear it the more I appreciate the finer things about this album like how perfectly the songs lead to each other (especially the second half of the album) and how great the backing guitar/drum playing is. And how cool the lyrics are, particularly in money where Waters sais ""don\'t give me that goody good bullshit."" For some reason whenever I hear cussing in classic rock songs it feels like the coolest thing ever and with an insult against goody goodness to boot makes it a monument of coolness.\n\nIn closing this is one of the best classic rock albums ever. It has some of the best instrument playing, lyrics and style of any album in music history and ages like fine wine.

mouzone,"['After the sacking of Syd Barrett and the dropping of Pink Floyd\'s psychadelic sound, the band underwent a series of transitional experimental albums, which were interesting but rather patchy, and tended to be dismissed by the band in later interviews. However, the band finally found their feet again with the spacy Meddle, and in particular its epic closer ""Echoes"", which kicked off Pink Floyd\'s second great era. This provided a blueprint for the band\'s next album, The Dark Side of the Moon which would become Pink Floyd\'s most revered and famous release.\n\nThe first thing to note regarding this album though is its general ambition. Pink Floyd set out to make a concept album about life and different factors in life. When concept releases (at least the most accessible ones) are usually made, most of the conceptual ""content"" so to speak is in the lyrics. Here, Pink Floyd have applied the concept musically as well. Nowhere is this more obvious than in ""The Great Gig In The Sky"", an ""instrumental"" song about death and the ascent to heaven. Long drawn out notes indicate clouds passing over, while the magnificent wordless gospel singing brings an angelic quality. It is the single most emotional moment in an album of beautiful ones, and a stunning highlight. It\'s not just the concept that is the only ambitious aspect here though. The Dark Side of the Moon just sounds huge. Whether it is the superb production or whether Pink Floyd utilized so many layers using various instruments, the term space rock doesn\'t just describe the genre here, so much as the scope of this album, from beginning to end. On the ""Breathe"" every single basic guitar chord and bent note sounds epic, yet effortless, giving a marvellous spaced out feeling as the beginning of life is portrayed. And despite all of this ambition and scope, the album held together wonderfully, making the listening of this work as a whole rather than breaking it up is almost essential. This context to songs such as the instrumental blowout of ""Any Colour You Like"", which really seems to be David Gilmour and Rick Wright both showing some fantastic musicmanship. The album also closes wonderfully, with ""Eclipse"" almost just providing a summary and conclusion to the rest of the album.\n\nAnd yet, some of these songs can also work brilliantly on their own. ""Time"" begins with ticking clocks and an intense bass riff, backed by some superb background drum soloing from Nick Mason, before launching into a wonderful mix of layered guitars, Rick Wright\'s trademark keyboard riffs and lyrics regarding how we tend to never value our time on this earth. It seems to chronicle the passing of time before ""The Great Gig In The Sky"". ""Money"" is possibly the most famous song from the album, starting with that iconic bass riff backing the noises of cash registers leading into a Roger Waters diatribe against materialism, followed by a marvellous saxophone solo, and an even better guitar solo from Gilmour. However personally, my favourite moment has to be the anti-war ""Us and Them"". Waters really shines lyrically here, with lines such as \'Forward he cried from the rear/ And the front rank died. /And the general sat and the lines on the map/ Moved from side to side.\' These vocals are in a duet with some absolutely breathtaking saxophone work, which complements the vocals perfectly. Once the chorus comes it is truly goosebump inducing, providing a truly emotional moment.\n\nDark Side of the Moon is a cultural milestone in the music world and has been loved and will continue to be loved generation after generation. And there is a reason for this. It is truly one of those rare moments where true perfection is reached in the crafting of an album, from the contextual ideas, to its musical execution and also a production. It\'s an album that will truly make you consider the value of music as an art, and the effort that can sometimes go into an album. It just makes you feel that if this much effort was put into all music, it would not be the disposable commodity it can sometimes be at times. It\'s one of those rare albums that can truly live up to all expectation, and is an album that has to be listened to at least once in every single person\'s lifetime.']",5.00 stars

CanadaRiot,"[""When people think of classic rock, they think of boring hard rock with the catchy chorus, guitar riffs that are pretty damn good and music that your parents would typically listen to. Well, Pink Floyd is not exactly classic rock, but I just want to put that information out there for the world to known just because I had to define classic rock eventually. Pink Floyd is a band that everyone knows for many reasons, The Dark Side of the Moon being one of those reasons (and just about any album that is in bold here). The Dark Side of the Moon is an album that stands the test of time, but is it a progressive rock gem that many has claimed it to be.\n\nThis album is rather popular, so popular in fact that there are many versions of this album (20th anniversary, bonus track, limited edition, etc.) each of which may or may not have the same album cover. Another thing to note is the fact that the album cover is pretty much up there as one of the most famous album covers of all time. Pink Floyd being a progressive rock band, had the very artsy album art done by (I am not really sure about that, but it sure as hell looks cool). Some even more miscellaneous information about this album being that it kind of syncs well with the movie The Wizard of Oz, crazy. Now being that I listen to some of the older era Pink Floyd, what do I think about David Gilmour compared to earlier vocalist Syd Barrett?\n\nI think that David Gilmour is a way better vocalist than Syd will ever be just because of the fact that he manage to bring technique to the group and elevate them to the next level. Pink Floyd being more progressive with this album being a huge improvement over their psychedelic era and because of that, I have to say that song structure is that much better. Gilmore dishes out some of the most complicated and at the same time effective guitar work and Roger Waters is a more than capable drummer (props to the many other additional musicians). The album flows well together with the initial concept of this album being materialism I am assuming, making this album an album that you would have to listen to fully in one sitting. To keep it simple, there will hardly be another band that can out progressive rock Pink Floyd for a reason.\n\nAn essential album and I would recommend this album to just about anyone that is into older rock, but wants something different than hard rock (classic rock, that is why I mentioned classic rock earlier). If you haven't heard of this album before (why?), I would say get this album and listen to the glory known as the Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nSound Off!"", 'Bit too high on the rating.']",4.00 stars

tommetal12,"['The Dark Side of the Moon brytyjskiego zespołu Pink Floyd to jedna z najbardziej znanych płyt nie tylko muzyki rockowej. Grupa założona w 1965 roku wydała swój najpopularniejszy album w 1973. O krążku napisano już bardzo dużo, więc nic odkrywczego raczej nie zdołam napisać. Powiem, że jest to płyta wyjątkowa. Z początku nie byłem do niej przekonany, uważałem, że pierwsze dwa dzieła zespołu są o niebo lepsze od „Ciemnej strony księżyca”. Jednak po kilku przesłuchaniach doszedłem, iż recenzowany koncept album nieco przebija dwa pierwsze krążki: The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn oraz A Saucerful of Secrets.\n\nGrupa nieco odeszła od psychodelicznej muzyki jaka ich charakteryzowała na początku. Twórczość na płycie The Dark Side of The Moon możemy scharakteryzować jako rock progresywny lub art rock. Taka muzyka cechowała zespół już na poprzedniej płycie, jednak na tym krążku „Floydzi” zdecydowanie podnieśli poziom względem ostatniej, przeciętnej płyty. „Ciemna strona księżyca” jest albumem koncepcyjnym, całość stanowi jedność. Mimo to oprawa instrumentalna w kilku utworach stanowi dużą różnicę. Krążek jednak niesamowicie łączy się w jedną, integralną całość. Teksty utworów są już dojrzalsze i nie opowiadają o np. kotach czy rowerach co niejednokrotnie miało miejsce we wczesnej dyskografii zespołu Pink Floyd. Tematyką utworów na albumie jest przemijanie czasu i ludzka chciwość.\n\nCałość rozpoczyna Speak to Me i Breathe. Obydwa kawałki stanowią jeden, cały utwór. Pierwsza część to tajemnicze dźwięki i rozmowy. Druga to trwający niecałe trzy minuty kawałek, typowy dla zespołu Pink Floyd. Rytmiczna perkusja i wyrafinowane dźwięki gitar oraz niezbyt krzykliwy wokal Gilmoura.\n\nDrugi kawałek On the Run to jednak nietypowe i niezwykle zagadkowe dźwięki syntezatorów. W tle słychać tajemnicze głosy i enigmatyczne śmiechy.\n\nTrzeci na płycie, Time rozpoczyna się czymś specjalnym dla fanów wszelkiego rodzaju budzików. Następnie następuje około dwuminutowa część instrumentalna, gdzie instrumentem przewodnim jest perkusja. Po tym akcie utworu mamy do czynienia z doskonałym utworem, w którym słychać niezwykłe łączenia muzyki progresywnej i jazzowej, które wyszły zespołowi naprawdę dobrze.\n\nCzwarty, The Great Gig In The Sky rozpoczyna się od fortepianowych brzmień. Po minucie trwania kawałka rozpoczyna się krzykliwa część wokalna wykonywana przez Clarego Torry. W tle słychać wciąż dźwięki fortepianów, niekiedy idealnie łączących się z gitarą i perkusją.\n\nKolejny na płycie to Money, który jest również najbardziej rozpoznawalnym utworem z tego albumu. Rozpoczyna się od dźwięków przekładania pieniędzy i otwierania kas. W utworze są dwie solówki, jedna z nich bardzo nietypowa, ponieważ zagrana na saksofonie.\n\nSzósty Us and Them zaczyna się bardzo spokojnie. Nabiera tempa podczas pierwszego refrenu, wokal jest trochę głośniejszy niż w pierwszej partii utworów. Druga zwrotka to jednak wciąż spokojny i wyrafinowany utwór. Us and Them to najwolniejszy kawałek na „Ciemnej stronie księżyca”.\n\nTrzeci od końca Any Colour You Like skomponowany jest przez nietypowe osoby. W tworzeniu utworu nie uczestniczył Roger Waters, co w tamtym okresie twórczości nie było codziennością. Utwór numer siedem jest piosenką instrumentalną, w której dźwięki gitar i perkusji łączą się z elektroniką i syntezatorami.\n\nPrzedostatni Brain Damage łączy się z ostatnim Eclipse i w pewnym sensie tworzą jedną kompozycję. Są one podsumowaniem tej płyty i opowiadają, że w obliczu końca wszystkie rzeczy uzyskiwane przez całe życie tracą swoją wartość.\n\nAlbum osiągnął ogromny sukces komercyjny. Sprzedał się w nakładzie grupo ponad 40 milionów egzemplarzy i jest jedną z pięciu najlepiej sprzedających się płyt w historii. Pod względem muzycznym The Dark Side of The Moon jest wspaniałym albumem. Niemalże pod każdym względem idealny. Zmiana psychodelicznych dźwięków znanych z początku dyskografii „Floydów” na dojrzalsze rytmy okazała się bardzo trafna. Całość w skali od 1 do 5 oceniam na 5.']",5.00 stars

I must admit it; I really didn’t get it at first. But after playing it non-stop, I can really see why many people worship this album. I can see why many people would say that this is the best album of all time. And I can see why this album sold over 15 millions copies in America. Though I felt that this is not the best album of all time, it’s definitely a must have album.\n\nThis album starts off with “Speak to Me/Breathe.” “Speak to Me” begins with a little heartbeat and helicopter, coins, laughing, and screaming to “Breathe.” It’s basically a little preview for this classic album. “Breathe” is a nice little song with Glamour’s guitar works. It sounds haunted. Anyway, in this song, the old man speaks to the baby and telling him what kind of life the baby will have in the future. Then it’s gone straight to “On The Run,” which is a great instrumental piece about traveling, without fading away. If you want to hear more of this great piece, go to Chicago Bulls game and you’ll hear it at the beginning. Anyway, at the end of the song, there was a huge explosion that will lead to “Time.” “Time” will really begin with like dozen of clocks chiming away. It’s great song about how time seems to pass you by so quickly, but many people don’t realize it until it’s too late. Then you get to this brief “Breathe (Reprise).” After that, it fades straight to “Great Gig in the Sky,” great song about death. It’s basically just Clare Torry just singing without actually saying anything. She’s basically screaming like if someone is having an orgasm. Still, it’s a great song.\n\n“Money” is one of my favorites on this album. It’s a great upbeat song (the only upbeat song on this album) with an unusual 7/8 time signature. It’s catchy, too. Great song about how bad money really is. The irony is this album sold like 15 millions copies in America. Plus great sax solo. Then it went straight to the next tune, “Us and Them,” which basically about people who are different from others in certain subject. Like war, politics, & class. Good song, but not really my favorite. Then it went to the next song, “Any Colour You Like.” It’s an OK instrumental song that supposes to be like “Breathe” the instrumental. But it went to THE best song on this album, “Brain Damage.” It’s a great song about insanity. I heard that it’s about Syd Barnett, the ex-member of the band. It’s definitely one of my favorites on here. Then its ended with a bang with “Eclipse.” Great way to end this album. The song ended with a man says, “There’s no dark side of the moon, really. Matter of fact, it’s all dark.”\n\nGreat album and great concept about experience in human nature. Again, it’s not really the best album in the world, but it’s damn sure worth buying. So what are you waiting for? Buy this classic right now.\n\nSpeak to Me/Breathe-4.5\nOn the Run-5\nTime-5\nThe Grerat Gig in the Sky-4.5\nMoney-5\nUs and Them-4\nAny Colour You Like-3\nBrain Damage-5\nEclipse-4.5\n\nSong rating: 4.5']",4.50 stars

Progfan77,"['The music on Dark Side of the Moon is very varied and incorporates several new elements that haven´t been heard on earlier releases by Pink Floyd. Lots of studio tricks, female backing and lead vocals and dominant sections with saxophone soloing are some of the new features on the album. We´re of course also treated with the trademark mellow vocals but also more rocking rough ditto which is great for the variation on the album. All songs seque into each other either by short sound effect interludes or they simply sound like parts of one longer song which for example is the case with Us And Them and Any Colour You Like. Songs like Breathe, Time and Brain Damage have always been favorites of mine but it´s songs like the experimental instrumental On the Run with its extensive use of studio tricks and the female led The Great Gig In the Sky that stand out from the rest as being vastly different from anything else Pink Floyd had released up until then.\n\nThere is a notable increase in the use of synth on the album compared to earlier releases which gives the album a fresh sound. David Gilmour´s guitar soloes on the album also need a mention as they are fantastic. So full of emotion. Many guitarists could learn so much from David Gilmour. Putting equal amounts of great emotion into each note can sometimes be much harder that playing faster than the speed of lightning.\n\nThe production on the album is outstanding.

AmazingRando81,"['This was my favorite album back when I was like 14 and in that phase where I thought that classic rock was the only good music out there. I probably haven\'t listened to it, before today, since I was 16, at which point my experience with mind-altering substances was nil.\n\nI was pretty resolute to dislike it. It isn\'t hard to see why. Any album hailed as often as this one as the ""best album ever"" is bound to disappoint. I was all set to write a review about how this is boring and not at all deserving of the label ""psychedelic,"" compared even to other Pink Floyd albums like Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\n\nSo, imagine my surprise when I listened to Breathe and there was a Silver Apples-style electronic interlude. Which is to say nothing of the drugged out, spacey atmosphere of the album as a whole. I wouldn\'t strictly call this psychedelic music, since the song structure itself is pretty pedestrian, but the formula seems to be simply written rock songs, slowed down, with a nice psychedelic sheen layered over them. And even if the melodies usually aren\'t too interesting on their own, it keeps them from getting boring.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, if this is the trippiest thing you\'ve ever heard, you aren\'t looking hard enough. But it\'s relaxed and full of nice ear candy that sounds dated but not embarrassingly so. This seems like a pastiche of different styles rather than a single consistent form, but that doesn\'t make it bad, and the cohesion of the entire album (sans Money) definitely helps it along.\n\nThe main problem is that the melodies are just boring, though most of the songs have some redeeming factor. Breathe has the spacey outro. Time starts out fun but gets repetitive and is saved by a guitar solo which, while not amazing, has a pretty good psychedelic vibe to it. Us and Them has a monotonous non-melody that gets saved by a chorus that absolutely explodes. Money doesn\'t fit at all, but even then it isn\'t a bad song, though it ruins the flow of the rest.\n\nLike I said, I wanted to dislike this, but I can\'t. It just isn\'t bad. And as non-genuine as all those people who say this is the best album of all time seem, equally non-genuine are those who seem to hate this for all sorts of reasons other than the music itself. It\'s easy to write off something as overrated as this album as bad. And it isn\'t like I can\'t see why people love this. It\'s inoffensive and easy to listen to while still having a pretty strong psychedelic vibe throughout. It\'s probably the trippiest an album can be while still appealing to a wide audience (or at least was before Merriweather Post Pavilion came along), so it\'s no surprise that so many people find it mind-blowing.\n\nAnyway, it\'s occasionally but rarely great, and never bad. As low-tempo and low-key as most of the songs are, it never really gets boring. I challenge anyone who dislikes this to question their motives and try to give it a fresh listen. It clearly isn\'t the best, or even their best, but there\'s something to be said for its consistency and its ability, even now, having spent several of my most formative years over-listening, to surprise me. I was all set to write something scathing about this, and even had a term picked out, ""proto-Coldplay,"" to describe its paradoxical (assumed) combination of banality and popularity, but I was forced to change my mind.']",3.50 stars

Una nueva era para el Rock había comenzado poco más de 10 años antes y el evento aún duraba, y lo que le quedaba...\n\n\nImaginate un disco en el que empiezas a escuchar extraños ruidos que te anuncian algo que está a punto de acontecer, un preludio a una obra extraña pero a la vez familiar, como unos coros perfectamente armoniosos te quieren meter en situación para algo que no esperas... ¿qué dices? ¿qué ya has hecho este viaje muchas veces? acomodate una vez más, porque siempre es la primera vez en este mundo oscuro... tan oscuro como el lado oculto de la luna.\n\nLa camilla en donde estás se abalanza hacía delante, nada la puede parar y no lo impides sin embargo, algo empieza ha aumentar, algo que se representa con un gran trabajo con los sintetizadores, algo se acerca, vamos a chocar y...\n\nEl tiempo, ¿por qué todas las canciones que hablan de esto son grandiosas? una introducción que cada vez que se escucha emociona poco a poco, muy lentamente hasta iniciar el viaje que esperabamos, el viaje a uno de los mejores discos de nuestra vida.

ChillePalmer,"['I may be underrating this one because I\'m sick of all the constant praise and radio play this album gets, however there are reasons why I react so negatively to the praise and overplay. There are 2 songs I definitely like here: ""Time"" and ""Great Gig in The Sky"". Time manages to be catchy and ominous once it gets to the actual song portion of it (I\'ll get to the intro later). It shares some of the traits of the rest of the album that I don\'t like such as occasional overproduction (the backup singers are too much) and it still has the spaced out post hippie vibe, but I still like this one despite how overplayed it is. The beauty of ""Great Gig in the Sky"" really hit me recently. I like the opening monologue about death, I like the way it\'s composed and the vocals by the girl are just beautiful. Many of the other songs I like moments, of or elements of such as ""Us and Them"" and ""Brain Damage"". I also like certain lyrics such as ""All you touch and all you see, is all your life will ever be"". I do somewhat respect the conceptual element of the album, even though it\'s not excecuted in a way that really moves me all that much.\n\nNow onto why I don\'t like this album. First of all there\'s too much meaningless time wasting. What makes this worse is that a lot of the time wasting is at the begining of the album. The ""Speak to Me"" part of ""Speak to Me/ Breath"" is just gimmicky sound effects, and overdone laughing and screaming. The rest of the song has some decent, profoundish lyrics, and it\'s pleasant sounding, but not particularly compelling. The next track ""On the Run"" is an example of a track that is only good when you\'re high. I admit I have had my mind blown once by this track, while under the influence, but every time listening to it since then, I\'ve just find this track to be pointless, repetitive noise. It\'s great for beginner stoners, but really it\'s just an annoyingly produced waste of wax. As I said above, ""Time"" is a pretty worthy song, but before you listen to the actual song you have to sit through annoying, overloud bells that lead into a ticking clock with some ominous notes being played that are admitedly well composed, but this whole intro just isn\'t engaging and it seems to go on forever. The fist 8 minutes of this album contain only 2 1/2 minutes of what could be considered songs, and even that song is nothing to write home about. I never liked any of this experimentation at the begining of the album. I didn\'t like it when I first got the album, and I don\'t like it now, and it\'s a part of the reason why I almost never play the album as a whole.\n\n""Money"" is an ok song, but it\'s soooooo overplayed and it\'s kind of corny. The cash register sounds are gimmicky as hell, but without them the song would probably have been too bland. I\'m not a big fan of the instrumental part of the song either, as it goes on too long and it\'s not that interesting. It also shows how bad Floyd could be lyrically too. ""Money, so they say/ is the root of all evil today"". Why even bother writing that down, let alone putting it in a song? I\'m mixed on ""Us and Them"" but leaning towards heavy indifference. The best thing about it is the relaxed mood, but that\'s pretty much ruined by the bloated choruses. It also seems to just go on and on until it just leaves me completely flat. ""Any Colour You Like"" seems to me like a mere continuation of ""Us and Them"", making the already overlong 7:40 minute song, an endless 11 minutes. Brain Damage is a nice little unpretentious song. I quite like that one. I love that lyric ""there\'s someone in my head, but it\'s not me"". Eclipse is an appropriate end to the album, but unfortunately, I don\'t like the album that much.\n\nThis album has some memorable songs that became hits, some profound statements about life and death, and it\'s great listening to when you first start smoking pot, and for those reasons I can kind of see why it\'s so popular. For me personally however, it doesn\'t add up to much. Waters vocals are pretty bland. They don\'t even seem to be ""technically"" all that great. They\'re relatively smooth I guess, but they lack depth, both tonally and emotionally. Another problem is that it\'s hard to know how to react to this album. It\'s much too mellow and spaced out to do anything but relax to, but it\'s too dark and spooky, and operatic to really relax to. I do like experimentation sometimes, but the experimentation here is too safe and candy coated for me to realy get excited about. Experimental soundscapes are supposed to create some kind of a mood and the stuff here doesn\'t really create that except for a spaced out, unfulfilling ""head in the clouds"" mood.\n\nOverall, I\'d say that moments are good and there\'s evidence of great songwriting and great production and a grand vision to enough of a degree that keeps this album from being completely terrible, but not enough to save it from the feeling of overblown, underemoted, gimicky, soulless, slick, detatched, post hippie medioccrity.\n\nBest song: Great Gig in the Sky']",2.50 stars

This album, for me, delivers a lot more than just music. The lyrics are incredibly compelling and the musicianship is brilliant. The music is structured quite flawlessly and each song seems to be conjoining. The addition of synthesizers throughout the album assists giving the music an eerie, almost ghostlike presence. Of course, I’m rambling on but attempting to illustrate my feelings towards this masterfully crafted album in words is near impossible for me. Perhaps if I had a more extensive range of vocabulary I might be able to articulate myself a little better.

JGEdge,"[""http://dontkillthemuzic.obolog.com\n\n¿Como resguardarse del mundanal ruido en la cara oculta de la luna?\n\nEn silencio y únicamente acompañado de una tenue pero cálida luz, aprieto el botón de play de mi equipo de música y concentro mis cinco sentidos en la observación de la portada de una maravillosa obra conceptual publicada en 1973. Es en ese momento cuando se abre ante mis ojos la fría oscuridad seccionda milimétricamente por un haz de luz blanca, que tras atravesar las entrañas de un perfecto prisma, se dispersa y fracciona en una paleta de colores que baña de calidez la negra oscuridad que encierra este magnífico trabajo. El prisma, ese maravilloso e increíble objeto que es capaz de transformar la luz en color, es también la metáfora que sirve de portada para esta extraordinaria obra de ensayo que data del cada vez más lejano siglo XX. Hace ya más de tres décadas que Pink Floyd consiguió ,como si de un prisma se tratase, que The Dark Side of the moon sirviese de catalizador entre el blues, el rock clásico y lo que hoy conocemos como la música electrónica. The Dark Side of the Moon es el resultado de la evolución que Pink Floyd llevó a cabo tras reaizar un magistral cambio de rumbo con la publicación de Meddle en 1971, un magnífico trabajo que ya diseccioné anteriormente. Este magnífico Meddle sirvió de catarsis para que los cuatro componentes de esta legendaria formación se desprendiesen de sus miedos creativos y se dejasen llevar por la experimentación pura como unidad indivisible. El resultado fue el disco más experimental y cohesionado de la banda (y uno de los más experimentales de la historia del rock), ya que los cuatro componentes participaron en la creación y producción de las canciones, (aunque todas las letras salieron de la increíble mente de Roger Watters).\n\nRoger Waters centró la temática de esta gran obra en el peligro que todos tenemos para caer en la locura, ya que el hombre moderno (¿alguien se acuerda del antiguo frontman : Syd Barret?) es asediado incesablemente por la guerra, la violencia, el tiempo, el dinero, la toma de decisiones, la muerte... Toda esta temática a parte de verse reflejada en la lírica del álbum también se refleja mediante los sonidos que encontramos en el mismo, por poner un ejemplo, en la pista nº 3 (On the Run) podemos escuchar a un avión estrellándose que representa el miedo a volar, la pista nº 4 (Time) empieza con el sonido de cientos de relojes que nos recuerda nuestra finita vida, la pista nº 5 (The grat gig in the sky) nos muestra musicalmente los lamentos por la muerte y en la pista nº 6 (la archiconocida Money) es una ironía al poder del dinero.\nA nivel puramente musical, Dark side of the Moon supuso un punto de inflexión en la historia de las técnicas de producción y grabación, ya que se introdujeron por primera vez sintetizadores (On the Run se considera la primera pieza electrónica de la historia del rock) que se mezclaron con “loops” superpuestos de sonidos cotidianos y voces para poder complementar a los instrumentos clásicos (guitarra, bajo y percusión). Todo ello se llevó a cabo bajo la magistral batuta de uno de los productores /ingenieros de sonido mas prestigiosos e innovadores de la historia de la música moderna : Alan Parsons.\nTreinta y cinco años después de su publicación, Dark Side of the Moon sigue siendo uno de los trabajos más representativos e innovadores de la historia del rock y, con permiso de Wish You Where Here, posiblemente el mejor trabajo de Pink Floyd.

smitty2112,"[""This is just a great album on so many levels. It is musically, lyrically, and vocally perfect. Understanding this album starts with the lyrics. Each song is about a different aspect of life that puts pressure on us. It is, quite simply, a list of all of the dark aspects of life coupled with biting, satirical phrasing and contrasting music. The music of every song is slow and contemplative, and is impeccably written and performed.\n\nThe album starts out with basically an overture, Speak to Me, which features a compilation of sound effects that are on the album, but really just serves to introduce the first great song: Breathe.\n\nBreathe talks about the pressures of dealing with stress in general, and features music that matches the musical theme of the album.\n\nNext comes On The Run, which will come across as pointless and annoying on the first couple of listens. However, by the 3rd or 4th listen, you will come to appreciate it. Lyrically, the song is about the pressure of having to travel a lot, and it is amazing how well Pink Floyd gets their point across with just a title, a single line of lyrics, a synthesizer, and some sound effects. Truly amazing.\n\nThen comes Time/Breathe Reprise, the strongest song both lyrically and musically on the album. Time features what i personally believe to be the greatest lyrics ever written, lyrics that can reverberate with both the young and old, lyrics that stand the test of, well, time... The guitar is awesome, the intro, while long, is great and symbolic. Breathe Reprise, the final stanza of the song, is about Religion.\n\nThe operatic Great Gig in the sky is a perfect mix of subdued music and an amazing female vocal. Once again, Floyd manages to convey the pressures of death with just a title and a whispered line in the middle of the song. Perfect.\n\nThe first song of the second side, Money, is one of Pink Floyd's most famous songs, and it deserves to be, with great lyrics, great guitar/sax solos, and great trademark sound effects in the beginning.\n\nUs and Them/Any Colour You Like are really one song, and provides the album with one of Pink Floyd's traditional 10 minute epics. The lyrics to Us and Them are just great, and the music complements it perfectly. The saxophone is awesome, and all of the instruments in the Any Colour You Like section are excellent and get better with every listen.\n\nBrain Damage is about the pressure of mental disease, or even the pressure of just being unique or different. The music here isnt as strong as on the other songs, but the lyrics are good.\n\nEclipse sums everything up, with happy music but NOT happy lyrics, for if the moon is life, and the sun represents good things in life, then Floyd is saying that the good things in life are eclipsed and forgotten by the pressures, stresses, and bad things in life. Which may be true.\n\nBut anyway\n\nThis album is a study in contrasts, from they lyrics and the music to the topics that are discussed about what is good and what is bad. Pink Floyd masterfully makes these comparisons and connections quietly, calmly, and devastatingly.\n\nAnother point: even though this album is slow, TURN IT UP!!!!! You can hear all of the parts really well and the whole thing just sounds absolutely amazing. Pink Floyd has some good base lines...\n\nThis is Pink Floyd's first perfect album. GET THIS ALBUM.""]",5.00 stars

Walter12,"['That\'s right, only 4.0 stars for Dark Side of the Moon. In my opinion, this is among the most over-hyped albums of all-time, and I even consider myself to be a big fan of Pink Floyd! That isn\'t to say that Dark Side of the Moon is bad in any way, just that much of it is unremarkable. ""On the Run"" and ""Great Gig in the Sky"" are especially disposable, while I\'ve also never been a huge fan of the radio hit ""Money"". Luckily, the record partially justifies its lofty status with the four-song suite that closes the album. Taking as a whole, those tracks rank behind only ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" and ""Echoes"" as the finest work of Pink Floyd\'s career.\n\nI suppose that pretty much everybody has already listened to this album. Still recommended to any fan of 70\'s rock, although I maintain that you haven\'t really heard Pink Floyd until you\'ve kicked back with Wish You Were Here and Animals.\n\nFavorite tracks: ""Time"", ""Us and Them/Any Colour You Like/Brain Damage/Eclipse""']",4.00 stars

oldguywithsticks92,"['The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nThat\'s all that really needs to be said isn\'t it? I give this a five out of respect and also that it is damn good, but this is neither their best or my favorite, that belongs to either Wish You Were Here or the criminally underrated Animals. There is no denying this is a masterpiece of rock, though, and many of the songs here are classic. I love how the album opens with a heart beating (and the album fades out with the heartbeat as well), which leads into ""Breathe"". Possibly my favorite song here is ""Time"", such powerful lyrics contained in that number.\n\nThe most famous one here is obviously ""Money"", and it is a classic. The old 45 edit of that is probably what got me into Floyd, that and hearing all of those Wall songs. Gotta love the sax on both ""Money"" and ""Us and Them"", to me it adds a lot to those songs. I have always enjoyed the final two, ""Brain Damage"" and ""Eclipse"" and how they perfectally segue into one another. For awhile, I thought the song was called The Dark Side of the Moon... not anymore.\n\nI can\'t say anymore, all of the words have been taken up, and I would be plagerizing someone, which I do not want to do.

QBsince1933,"['This album was given to me by an arrogant friend of mine claiming it would ""change my life"". While it\'s fallen way short of doing so, it has provided some enjoyment to someone who doesn\'t listen to alot of rock and roll. What makes this album great to some might also make it less enjoyable to others. Each track on the album flows seamlessly into the other and many of the tracks begin with long instrumentals. Towards the middle of the album you have ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" which is a well done voice instrumental. Do these elements make for a great album? To some it will, to others it might not. The album seems to get less interesting towards the end, but that might be only because ""Us and Them"" is the highest point on the album.\n\nBest Songs: Time, The Great Gig in the Sky, Money, Us and Them\n\nOverall: This is a good album that will appeal to some but not to others.

Nesquik,"['By all accounts, The Dark Side of the Moon is an album that should be a disgrower. It\'s one of the first full albums I grew to appreciate and it\'s also one of the greatest albums ever created. The argument could be made that it\'s actually the greatest album of all time and it would probably have my vote. Furthermore, it\'s never been my favourite Pink Floyd album except maybe when The Wall was the only other one I knew. And for a time Dark Side of the Moon slipped down my list a bit, but it\'s found itself a bit of a resurgence. Probably the biggest thing with this album is its commitment to it\'s theme. A lot Pink Floyd\'s work has a certain vibe to it, but on The Dark Side of the Moon it is the most consistent (with the exception of the track ""Money"", which is good enough to overlook it being out of place). I can\'t really put into words what the music sounds like. It has a somewhat dark, definitely spacey atmosphere to it that matches the album cover, but it has a bit of a range of emotion to it - sometimes hopeful, sometimes cynical, sometimes sad, yet always presented with distance.\n\nI\'ve always had a lot of respect for this album and saying it\'s my third or fourth favourite album in the band\'s discography is no insult considering how much incredible material Pink Floyd has produced. It certainly is one of the great landmarks in music history and I think it deserves that claim.']",4.50 stars

To this day I consider this one of maybe 3 or so albums that I believe are more than just perfect, but completely flawless (the others being ""London Calling"" & ""Exile on Main Street""). The first time I listened to this album, I was probably 12 or 13 and I was really into early 90\'s grunge rock at the time, so I was a little put off by the experimental aspects of this album...the use of clocks and sound effects and the vocal solo on \'The Great Gig in the Sky\', just didn\'t seem like great rock to me, but I didn\'t dismiss it completely. I listened to the other 70\'s Pink Floyd album and fell in love with ""Wish You Were Here"", after which I decided to revisit Dark Side and began to realize just how superb this album really is:\n\n""Speak to Me/Breathe"": The album begins with the lone sound of a heartbeat and sound clips foreshadowing each of the songs to come. The first song then instructs you to sit back, breathe in the air, empty your head, and prepare for and mind-blowing album unlike any other to enter your consciousness.\n""On the Run"": After the calm of the first song, the album picks up this pace with this interesting fast-paced synthesizer piece that encapsulates all the hustle & bustle of everyday life.\n""Time"": This track begins with alarm clocks going off and is essentially a response to the previous track about life passing you by without you even realizing it. Plus a pretty sweet unconventional Pink Floyd guitar solo (a little grungy sounding)...an excellent song.\n""The Great Gig in the Sky"": WOW, what absolutely astonishing singing for 4 1/2 minutes... that\'s all I need to say.\n""Money"": Probably the catchiest and most immediately recognizable track on the album with it\'s fancy bass-hook.\n""Us & Them"": The highlight of the album, an intense song with a spectacular chorus, I am usually fully entrenched in the album by now and would refuse to acknowledge anyone trying to interrupt it.\n""Any Colour You Like"": Another great instrumental track that allows you to cool off from the previous track, and leads into the end of the album.\n""Brain Damage/Eclipse"": At this point in the album, Pink Floyd has expanded you brain so much that the increase in entropy has left your brain feeling damaged, but not to fear because everything you know to be real exists under the sun...but the sun is eclipsed by the moon, and the album ends where it began, with the lone sound of a heartbeat. Awesome!\n\nThis album is pretentious and so much has been said about it over the years, but it is one of the rare instances where all of the hype is completely justified, not a single note is wasted throughout the 43 minute running time. Masterpiece.\n\n-MMM']",5.00 stars

In questa fase la band è ormai lontanissima dall’era dei viaggi interstellari e dalle infantili filastrocche barrettiane. Il timone è nelle mani di Waters. A guidarlo, le sue ossessioni. A parlare male di questo disco si rischia il linciaggio. E come parlar male di pezzi come Time, The Great Gig in the Sky, con il suo assolo vocale da pelle d’oca. Però, però,però… a noi il disco sembra in molti passaggi freddo e asettico, senza linfa e senza sangue. Il problema degli impianti stereo? Solo di rado provano emozioni. No, non ce ne andremo mai in giro con la T-shirt“I Hate Pink Floyd” come invece amava fare Johnny Rotten ai concerti dei Sex pistols ma The Dark side of the Moon ci sembra davvero un prodotto degli ipertofici anni Settanta pre-punk, che, come quasi tutta la musica dell’epoca, non è invecchiato benissimo.

whitey25,"['Right before I really got into music I knew of the big progressive rock bands of the 1970\'s, King Crimson, Camel etc. But Pink Floyd was one of these bands when I was around 10 years old I listened to this album along with The Wall and didn\'t really understand it. Now a few years on I\'ve come across these vinyls in my parent\'s old record collection.\n\nPink Floyd always fantasied me due to the huge popularity. I know of this album; The Dark Side of the Moon is hailed as a masterpiece but to be frank I don\'t think it is. Yes it\'s good it has everything a fan of progressive rock needs and craves but I\'ll rather get my kicks somewhere else. Maybe it was ""I had to be there"" moments in history but I do like this album just for the \'cool\' factor as it were.\n\nAnyway there are many classic songs on here but the one which really does it for me is Money I really like this song, really. It\'s probably one of the first progressive songs I heard and it will stick. Yes there is Time, The Great Gig in the Sky and a few others but I prefer Money.\nThe production for it\'s time sounds great, it\'s very clear the vocals, drums and guitars all are mixed well. I think at the time most bands wanted to get the peak of production just for the listeners. And on vinyl the little crackles, whistles and pops you get do add to the atmosphere which is always great I find.\n\nOverall this is a great album. To be fair the playback is quite limitedness due to the hugeness of the fan base and popularity of this album, but it\'s because it\'s really great. I\'m not a massive fan of Pink Floyd so that\'s why it\'s only rated 4 stars, maybe with intense listens it may creep up higher but for now I think it\'s worth it.']",3.50 stars

maxjtotsky,"['The Dark Side of the Moon- Pink Floyd\n\nPink Floyd has today been one of the most inspiration progressive rock bands of all time. ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ was a huge success. It was their best selling album selling over 15,000,000 copies in just the USA. It was also the third best selling album worldwide and started on the billboard top 200 for 741 consecutive weeks, over fourteen years despite it only stayed in the #1 spot for one week. Many critics have noted it as one of the best albums of all time. In 2003 Rolling Stone magazine ranked it 43 on it’s 500 best albums of all time.\n\nPink Floyd started out in 1967, with a different singer Syd Barrett. Barrett had a distinctive British accent and sung eacky songs such as “Bike” and “Matilda Mother” on ‘The Piper at the Gates of Dawn’. He only performed on one song on Pink Floyd’s 1968 album ‘A Saucerful of Secrets’ then he left. He was replaced by his childhood friend David Gilmour and during this era they made two albums, ‘More’ and ‘Meddle’. ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ was when the band really got into making great music and writing exceptional lyrics although the album has very many traces of experimentation.\n\nThe album cover has been one of the most notable in rock history. It is recognized by everyone and was a very creative idea. The iconic cover is light reflecting onto a triangular prism and the light turns into the colors of the rainbow on the other side of the prism. It was created by George Hardie and was voted 35 on Rolling Stone’s 100 greatest album covers.\n\nThe album is an early concept album. Inspired by other concept albums like ‘Days of the Future Passed’ by the Moody Blues or ‘Tommy’ by the Who. But these two albums tell specific stories using characters and plots. ‘Dark Side…’ doesn’t have a plot. It is about what bassist and princible songwriter Roger Waters considered human experience or life. Conflict (“Us And Them”), greed (“Money”), mental illness (“Brain Damage”) and ageing (“Time”) are main concepts. The album starts with silence and then in fourty seconds the sound of a cash register and helicopter then a scream and the progressive chords of “Speak to Me/Breathe” come in. In about two and a half minutes David Gilmour starts singing lyrics about birth, childhood and chores. Then the song goes into the odd instrumental “On the Run” and gets silent again. Clocks start chiming and your into “Time” a seven minute song about getting out of youth before you know it and growing old. It features a notable solo at the beginning and then goes progressive. It is one of the highlights on the album and is amazingly played and sung. Then goes into “The Great Gig in the Sky”, a lyricless song which is sung by Clare Torry. It doesn’t have words but Waters claimed it explores religon and death. “Money” is another key track and has an unforgettable riff along with lyrics mocking greed and work. “Us and Them” is written and sung by keyboardist Richard Wright about war and conflict. It features amazing saxaphone and has a mellow and depressing melody. “Any Colour You Like” is an instrumental that is pretty much part of “Us and Them”. It then goes into “Brain Damage” and song about mental illness and insanity. It is an amazing highlight sung by Roger Waters and has an amazing riff. The album concludes with Eclipse which is like part two to “Brain Damage”.\n\nThe album is a must have and is as important as you get in rock history. There is not one song that has a major flaw in it and all together is pretty much the perfect album. It has something for everyone wether your into hard rock on depressing sounding piano you can find what you need in this album.\n\nWater’s lyrics are fantastic. They are not as poetic as songwriters like Bob Dylan or John Lennon but stay on topic and give you everything you need to know about the concept. “Speak to Me/Breathe” has a notable verse about comparing youth to a rabbit digging holes and “Money” mocks being rich with lyrics like “I have a high fidelity first class traveling set and I think I need a lear jet”. “Us and Them” protests against war with “Us and Them/After all we are both ordinary men”. And “Brain Damage” features the catchy lyrics that go through the song like “The lunatic is on the grass” or “The lunatic is in the hall”. There are voices in the album in the middle of instrumental or silent parts of the tracks. Water held up signs with questions on them and then recorded friends answers and put them on the album. All of the questions had to do with the albums concepts like greed, violence and metal illness.\n\nThe music topple the lyrics by far though. Gilmour is a guitar legend notably on “Money” where he has the notable guitar riff or the solo on “Time”. This album is the ultimate album and may be the best ever since The Beatles ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonley Hearts Club Band’.']",5.00 stars

No other album was ever this groundbreaking or innovative. Dark Side Of The Moon stayed on the charts for an utterly amazing 714 weeks, a truly astounding achievement. This album has some of the most amazing songs ever recorded, and they appear with startling regularity. Breathe, Time, Money, Us & Them. the mind blowing just keeps coming. The engineering, production, and use of sound effects to enhance the storyline in this album is just breathtaking. And the musicianship, by all four band members working as a unified team is one of the many variables that come together to give Dark Side Of The Moon it's just rank as the greatest. Another of the great things about the album is just when You think nothing can make it any better something does. Yet another example of it's utter greatness is the fact it has arguably the greatest shattering album finale ever with the stunning one two punch of Brian Damage/Eclipse. And Dark Side Of The Moon's delving deep into the human psyche and condition of man's fragile mind and intellect touches a thread deep in us all, and that, in the end, is what makes Dark Side such an unrivaled masterwork.""]",5.00 stars

icehockeyhair00,"[""At first glance it doesn't scream 'one of the best albums of all time', as it's strengths lie in its subtle grandiosity, and how it all flows together into one, faultless, inter-linking masterpiece.\n\nOf course there are also all the sound effects throughout that really do add something to the music. Preceded be the steady heartbeat of 'Speak to Me', 'Breathe' draws you in slowly like a hunter snaring his pray, whilst it's later reprise (after 'Time') snatches you, unannounced, as if it's part of the song it follows. And then there’s 'On The Run' which seems to be virtually 1970s techno, and certainly rather post-modern for this era, or a nod to krautrock, I guess.\n\nFollowing this is a blast of grandfather clocks which herald the arrival of 'Time' which in itself heralds the middle section of amazing songs, itself being rather epic, and incredibly thoughtful. It is followed by Richard Wright’s fine and moving 'The Great Gig In The Sky', the classic jaunt 'Money' (with plenty of coins rattling) and the powerfully beautiful 'Us and Them'. Easily four of their greatest songs.\n\nThe final movement of songs starts with the jangly and futuristic instrumental 'Any Colour You Like', which is probably more developed than OTR. That then leads into the epic, brilliant two-part finale: 'Brain Damage' is spectacularly good, almost a clincher in itself, but the job is finished off by 'Eclipse', which may as well be part of the same song, but still great.\n\nBrilliant.""]",5.00 stars

SilverScreen89,"[""Pink Floyd were able to create such wonderful music. And they did it so uniquely and in such a new and experimental manner that places them deservedly at the top of the music history ever. This album is just one of their best, possibly battling for that honor with The Wall. It still is one of the most beautiful albums ever, and one of the deepest works in rock music.\n\nTime takes your breath away. And particularly, the bit in which the keyboard fades it into The Great Gig in the Sky. That bit alone could well be the best bit in the whole album. But it's amazing the way in which Pink Floyd are able to include the operatic Great Gig in the Sky, with terrific vocals and symphonic music, with the commercial track of the album with the infectuous bass and guitar riff, Money, which is also one of the best tracks of the album. The Dark Side of the Moon has such a variety of music that it doesn't only succeed in being one of the best albums ever, it also becomes an experience. A cosmic adventure. This is perhaps done even better in The Wall, that becomes a cinematic and artistic experience.""]",5.00 stars

I got so sick of hearing Brain Damage and Eclipse.\nI think its funny that the members admit to not being very musically gifted and had to take a different route from other popular bands in the 70's because blues rock was too hard.

fairyeee,"['I really appreciate this album. When you start listening to it and concentrate on it, you suddenly find you have slipped from your everyday reality to some other side of the moon. I don\'t consider it dark. It is just a different side, and the difference is so considerable that the album must be called \'otherworldly.\'\n\nThe most famous song on the album remains ""Money"", which in my opinion is slightly sad – while it isn\'t the best track on the album in my opinion – but even more, it is telling. ""Money"" is the only song on The Dark Side of the Moon which is about this side of the moon. I mean, money. A bizarre 7/8 rhythm pattern perhaps, but it is only, yes, only progressive rock. Of course it is well crafted, well played and for its genre exceptionally well composed. On the other hand it lacks the psychedelic otherworldliness of ""Breathe"", ""Time"", ""Us and Them"" and ""Brain Damage."" Especially ""Us and Them"" really presents a pathway to another world where everything flows and time is a relative matter. 7:50? Where did it go? The song called ""Time"" is slightly less wondrous, but still it is a worthy classic.\n\nDespite all the aforementioned special qualities, I wouldn\'t name The Dark Side of the Moon in my personal Top 10 and I am not even sure about Top 50. The strange, appealing feel of the album can\'t completely disguise the fact that there are only five real songs on the album. All the rest are prelude, interlude & postlude stuff: important binding the package together, but not that outstanding as music. ""Us and Them"" is a 5.0 level song, the whole thing can be listened to with good vibes, without frustration but, sincerely, there are even better albums on earth.']",4.50 stars

Even if the technology has been surpassed many times over throughout generations, the fact that Pink Floyd were using all of the modern tools at the time to create an experience that feels more like a psychological journey than a disposable song to song-till-the-next-one-comes-out record is a task that couldn\'t just be slept on to be made. This thing\'s got overdubs up the ass. You\'ve got spoken word things showing up in the middle of songs, sampled sound effects being used as the glue that holds some of the songs together while also representing their theme. While the highlight of this technology is best represented and overshadows the rest of the album in terms of futuristic qualities on ""On the Run"", with sequencers, synthesizers and trippy repetitions being thrown around left and right, the rest of the album is still able to drop in many inspired moments without any of the materials used in ""On the Run"" being used again.\nWhile the album lists 9 songs, really about half of that is just interludes. Like the albums before and after DSOTM, Pink Floyd really just made another 5 to 6 six song album with greater ease of navigating through the songs. With nothing over 7 minutes long, DSOTM is the most approachable of any of Pink Floyd\'s albums. The Wall may also fit that definition in song lengths, but it is about twice the length of DSOTM. Why it matters which Pink Floyd album you get into first is not important, but it explains why it is such a classic that has not been glazed over as each new generation gains their ears. Even if you have no interest in what else Pink Floyd has to offer, DSOTM is a completely different experience from any album you\'ll find, like a movie for your ears, it\'s full of surprises even after listening 100 times, it\'s masterfully edited.']",3.50 stars

Canvasback,"['Here is my 2 cents on this album. Now, I didn’t listen to it much in the past. Overall, I thought it was a little long-winded at the time. Finally, it’s just now starting to sink in. I always thought “Us and Them” was amazing. But, when I settle down, and really let these pieces of art resonate through me, I start to discover the layers. And I say “pieces”, I should say one big canvas. To me, it’s not so much what each song is doing, but how they all flow from the beginning to the end. From the opening “Speak to Me” soundscape, through the memorable melody of “Breath” the frantic pulsations of “On the Run” and of course “Time’s” clocks going off in my head. It was on “The Great Gig in the Sky” that I grew up, allowed the whole big voiced girl sound reverberate through me and carry me into, well,…. the sky. From then on it’s just a continuation of this fantastic journey. I’ll see you on the “Dark Side of the Moon.""']",4.50 stars
bananaLP,"['I don\'t get it. Is there something I\'m missing?\n\nI feel like this album is a classic example of an album that gets such rave reviews only because of its ""legendary"" critical status (see also: every single album by the Beatles). I listened to DSotM a lot after I first heard it (I was just starting to ""get into"" music at the time), mostly so I could ""fit in"" with other music fans, most of whom seem to adore this album. Then I thought long and hard, and realized that, every time I listened to DSotM, I basically was spending the first three tracks twiddling my thumbs and waiting for ""Time"" to come on; beyond that, I was mostly idling while I waited for the fabulous ""Any Colour You Like"" (which in spite of this album\'s hype has NEVER has gotten its due from critics or fans), and for the pretty solid one-two punch that closes the album. Between those standout tracks, there\'s nothing much to get me excited--the vocals and lyrics are both relatively weak throughout, the album OPENS with 3 tracks of unadulterated filler, ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" is the definition of ""a track that disrupts the flow of the album"", ""Money"" is trite and repetitive, and ""Us and Them"" flat-out puts me to sleep most of the time.\n\nI\'ll give it 2.5 stars--mostly for ""Time"" and ""Any Colour You Like"".']",2.50 stars

Every song on Dark Side of The Moon seems to flow into each other, making it almost a sin to not listen to it in it\'s entirety in one sitting.

Featus,"['Pink Floyd является одной из самых любимых мною команд, и хотя альбом «Wish You Were Here» я считаю вершиной их творчества, не стоит забывать и о его предшественнике, остававшемся в американском списке 200 лучших альбомов в общей сложности 760 недель, т.е. почти 15 лет. Разве это не показатель? Что же это за великолепное творение с минималистской обложкой (призмой, разлагающей белый свет в спектр), музыкальное полотно, за которое звукоинженер Алан Парсонс получил «Эмми», шедевр, о котором большинство представителей современной молодежи и понятия, к сожалению, не имеет? Роджер Уотерс уже давно хотел сделать полностью концептуальный и структурированный альбом, который бы выразил его мировосприятие и язвительное отношение к социальным институтам. Однако ничего бы не вышло без участия Дэвида Гилмора, очень талантливого в музыкальном отношении человека, на этом альбоме представшего также ведущим вокалистом, прекрасно спевшем стихи Уотерса. Кстати о названии «Темная / обратная сторона луны». Интересно, что пластинку с таким же названием в конце 1971 г. выпустила малоизвестная английская группа Medicine Head, так что пришлось изменить задуманное название альбома на «Eclipse». К счастью для Pink Floyd, творение Medicine Head полностью провалилось, и будущий альбом наших героев вновь обрел первоначальное название, но музыканты опять пребывали в сомнениях относительно его точности. На обложке первых тиражей пластинки, а также CD было написано «The Dark Side of the Moon», однако в последующих тиражах первый артикль был опущен. Что ж, теперь пройдем по этому гениальному творению шаг за шагом.\n1) «Speak to Me» – своеобразная минутная увертюра, в которой присутствуют фрагменты основных музыкальных тем и звуковых эффектов альбома. На заднем плане слышатся фразы «Я был сумасшедшим все эти гребаные годы» и «Я всегда был сумасшедшим, как и большинство из нас. Очень трудно понять, почему ты сумасшедший, даже если ты не сумасшедший».\n2) Далее идет песня «Breathe in the Air» (или просто «Breathe»), показывающая разочарование Уотерса бесконечной гонкой за успехом, в которую превращается жизнь: «Беги, кролик, беги, рой нору, забудь о солнце».\n3) Инструментал «On the Run» был задуман как отражение параноидального страха перед смертью и, в частности, перед авиаполетами. Мы слышим, как задыхающийся человек спешит на самолет, который затем взлетает и падает с грохотом, эхо от которого рассеивается очень долго. Реальность музыкального полотна, созданная синтезатором Synthi-A, последним достижением музыкальной техники на тот момент, просто потрясающая.\n4) «Time» – пессимистическая песня о том, как впустую мы тратим драгоценные мгновения нашей жизни (странно, но Уотерсу было тогда всего 28 лет). Начинается она с потрясающего боя и звона часов, которые на последующих концертах звучали особенно впечатляюще. Запоминается также великолепное соло Гилмора. В конце песня переходит в более оптимистическую репризу «Breathe»: «Снова дома. Я люблю бывать здесь, когда могу».\n5) «The Great Gig in the Sky» первоначально была фортепианной пьесой, во время которой читался Экклезиаст – в качестве демонстрации, как религия может свести с ума. Однако, чтобы не навлечь проклятий религиозных фанатиков, от такой идеи пришлось отказаться, а композиция стала повествовать о страхе перед смертью в авиакатастрофе. Чтобы сделать инструментал еще более выразительным, решено было привлечь сессионную певицу, от чьего голоса, то стонущего, то словно зовущего куда-то, просто перехватывает дыхание.\n6) Вторая часть альбома начинается с наиболее часто исполняемой группой композиции – «Money». Песня о неприятии мира большого бизнеса начинается с потрясающего скачущего из динамика в динамик звука открываемой кассы и звона денег. Создавалось это очень долго и кропотливо – пленку с записью звона разрезали на мелкие кусочки, а потом склеили их так, чтобы звон монет точно совпадал с ритмом песни. Вот на какие ухищрения приходилось идти за неимением современной техники, позволяющей теперь сделать то же самое за считанные минуты. Впечатляют гитары и агрессивно звучащий (можно сказать, даже ревущий) саксофон.\n7) «Us and Them» – песня об извечном конфликте между разными слоями общества, из-за ее грустности так и не вошедшая когда-то в фильм «Забриски Пойнт» для сцены разгона полицией студентов. Спокойный в начале темп с миролюбивым саксофоном сменяется жесткой игрой всех инструментов.\n8) Инструментал «Any Colour You Like» был некоторой уступкой прошлому, чтобы хоть что-то в альбоме напоминало о старом Pink Floyd. Кстати, эта синтезаторно-гитарная композиция – единственная на альбоме, написанная без Уотерса и не имеющая никаких фраз на заднем плане (в отличие от других инструменталов). Название взято из рекламы первого в мире автомобиля массового производства, «форда Т», где покупателю предлагалась на выбор машина «любого цвета, если этот цвет – черный».\n9) «Brain Damage» – песня, появившаяся как размышление о Сиде Баррете, но имеющая более общий смысл, объясняемый самим Уотерсом: «В каждом из нас сидит сумасшедший, которого мы пытаемся удержать внутри».\n10) Завершается альбом великолепной «Eclipse», короткой и ударной песней с великолепным образом солнца, скрываемого луной: хоть луна – недостатки и пороки человека – и меньше солнца – хороших качеств, – но она его все-таки затмевает. В самом конце альбома, как и в его начале, слышатся звуки бьющегося сердца – заканчивается одна жизнь, начинается другая, мало чем отличающаяся. При этом звучит просто потрясающая фраза, произнесенная лифтером студии, где записывался альбом: «Нет никакой темной стороны луны. На самом деле она вся темная».\nВ общем, поставить этому альбому меньше 10, а в особенности, на основании глупого представления, что он устарел, – преступление. Он совершенно не устарел, и лежащее в его основе утверждение, что в современном мире каждый должен бороться за сохранность рассудка, чтобы не сойти с ума, не потеряло своей актуальности и по сей день, благодаря чему действительно прогрессивные люди будут продолжать слушать это творение и размышлять о жизни и о том, что нужно делать, чтобы остаться здравомыслящим человеком в этом безумном (а может быть, и слишком нормальном) мире.\n\nРецензия написана 7 августа 2004 года\nПервая публикация: www.darkside.ru']",5.00 stars

TheAI,"[""If you've never heard of TheDark Side of the Moon, you've been living in a hole since birth, and so have your parents and grandparents. The greatest album by space hippies Pink Floyd, it is known by nearly every living being on Earth for good reason. It is a wonderful blend of studio weirdness for audiophiles, crazy instrumentation, and psychadelic vocals and is one of the greatest albums ever made. It is also unique in that there are (for the most part) no pauses in between tracks; the album is a bit like one whole song with a bunch of directional changes. It's the closest thing to a combination of a classical suite and rock that's out there.\n\nSong by song breakdown (though it is pretty hard):\n\nSpeak To Me: Good instrumentaltrack that builds up the suspense to the next track. A prime example of the studio craziness that permeates this album.\n\nBreathe: Another great track, though not very noteworthy.\n\nOn the Run: Sounds very cool, and builds up into the next track nicely.\n\nTime: OH MY GOSH. This song is amazing! Pink Floyd at their finest.\n\nThe Great Gig in the Sky: Worst song on the album, but still decent; not unlistenable.\n\nMoney: BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM. EVER. It's so... incredible and surreal.\n\nUs and Them: Overrated, but it's still pretty amazing.\n\nAny Colour You Like: Wow. I didn't pay attention to this song until recently. Now I see how great it is.\n\nBrain Damage: Awesome space hippie stuff. Pink Floyd was so weird!\n\nEclipse: Another space hippie track. Nice way to close the album.\n\nSo, if you've read this review and don't own the album, buy it NOW or the Supreme God Of Rock will bite your head off and bury you in a landfill of Michael Bolton CDs.

TheNintenGenius,"['Ah yes, Dark Side. The album that most people consider to be the alpha and omega of Pink Floyd\'s catalog. The album in which the band finally solidified their sound and production and rocketed up the charts. The album that\'s most people\'s introduction to Pink Floyd, including mine. The album that\'s so engrained in most fans\'s consciousness that you barely need to listen to the album as you discover that you know the entire thing by memory already.\n\nHere\'s the thing; yes, the album is certainly a masterwork of production. The band had finally discovered the general sound they wanted their albums to have from this point onward and they exploit this sound to its fullest on this release, creating an album of a singular mood, sound, and purpose. This is truly where the Pink Floyd conciet of songs flowing into each other begins, and the band\'s use of recorded voice clips and sound effects throughout add to the conceptual continuity of the whole thing (to steal a phrase from Frank Zappa).\n\nThe problem with Dark Side, though, is that beneath the gloss and sheen of the production, the album isn\'t really that much better than the ones immediately preceding it. It certainly sounds better, owing to the jacked-up production, but it\'s not exactly the masterwork or end-all, be-all that people would expect you to think it is. The album\'s problem is not that it doesn\'t have outstanding songs; to be honest, many of this album\'s best tracks are still among the best the band ever had any involvement with. ""Breathe,"" ""Time,"" ""The Great Gig in the Sky,"" ""Us and Them,"" and ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"" are still tracks that I love dearly and should be in most Pink Floyd fans\' list of favorites. And the album\'s subject matter overall, though perhaps a bit too bombastic and general, is still gripping, with a sort of universalism that is probably what draws so many people to the album in the first place.\n\nThe big problem is that the band are entirely too focuses on making the album a sweeping, grandiose concept album instead of delivering a consistently good set of songs. ""On the Run"" and ""Any Colour You Like,"" though they do a good job working as linking tracks, aren\'t really good songs in and of themselves, with the former\'s relentless drone quickly becoming repetitive and dull, and the latter simply being unmemorable. And then there\'s ""Money,"" that damned divisive track ""Money."" While I don\'t think it\'s a bad song, especially, it just plain doesn\'t fit on the album, and opening side two with a song whose sound is so at odds with the rest of the album is just weird and breaks the flow.\n\nIt\'s hard to really repeat what the album does right without simply repeating things that thousands of rock critics have already said before, so it\'s probably best to end the review right here. Is this the best album of all time? No. Is it even the best album in Pink Floyd\'s catalog? I don\'t think so. Despite the fact that the album is overrated, though, it\'s still among the best the band released, and its radio-friendly sheen still makes it the perfect album to introduce people to the band with. Nice album, overall.']",4.00 stars

It contains a blend of experimental elements, psychedelic sounds, and classic rock that defined it as the quintessential progressive rock album. The lyrics reflect philosophically about the alienation of the human soul in light of the ephemeral pleasures of the modern world (Money, Breathe, Time). Themes of banality, emptiness and mental collapse arise in other tracks (Brain Damage, Eclipse). Taken as a whole, the music amalgamates with the lyrics to give this record an otherworldly, surreal feel. This is accentuated with the outstanding sleeve design by Storm Thorgerson. Despite the great individual tracks, there is no greater listening experience than enjoying it from start to finish. This is the triumph of the mind.']",4.50 stars

This is rarely more apparent than on Pink Floyd\'s 1973 magnum opus, The Dark Side of the Moon. Despite it\'s blockbuster sales and formerly unchallenged greatness, it has now become cool to diss the album as overrated 70s junk. Many people see it as the start of a time when music became more about sell out crowds and millions of records sold, rather than artistic integrity. Of course, Pink Floyd\'s following releases, which dealt many criticisms towards the music industry, prove that Floyd themselves were mearly casualties of the music businesses hunger, not participants.\nI can say without shame that The Dark Side of the Moon is my favorite album of all time. It doesn\'t matter when or where I put it on, my mind is always blown, and I find myself listening to the entire thing attentively. Like a fantastic novel, The Dark Side of the Moon takes me away. Not to a different reality though. The strength of The Dark Side of the Moon is that the music transfers you into space, but the lyrics and overall atmosphere make sure that part of you stays grounded. Like a few hits of good acid, The Dark Side of the Moon takes you away to a place where you can look at the world and your life more clearly, and allows you to see the world for how it really is.\nA lot has been written about this album. I could go on and on about David Gilmour\'s mind blowing guitar playing (especially on ""Time"" and ""Money""), Roger Waters\'s lyrics (""Down and out/it can\'t be helped but there\'s a lot of it about/with, without and who\'ll deny it\'s what the fighting\'s all about"" and ""leave but don\'t leave me/look around, choose your own ground/for long you live and high you fly/and smiles you\'ll give and tears you\'ll cry/and all your touch and all you see/is all your life will ever be""), Richard Wright\'s atmospheric keyboard playing (""Us and Them,"" ""Any Colour You Like""), the sophisticated use of musique-concrete on a rock record (""Speak to Me,"" ""On the Run,"" ""Time,"" ""Money""), the outstanding production values that made this album the test for radios used by audiophiles, it\'s 741 consecutive weeks on the Billboard charts, it\'s over 30 million copies sold.

Speak To Me is an odd instrumental piece, before the vocals kick in on Breathe. Breathe is a nice song, easy to listen to, and probably the most mainstream of the lot. This is followed by the bizarre On The Run, which uses a synth to create all sorts of weird noises. After the explosion at the end, alarms go off signifying the beginning of Time. Time is a good song, with a great guitar solo to boot, equal of Led Zeppelin solos even.\nGreat Gig In The Sky features piano and female vocals. The song is about death as can be heard by the voices speaking in the background.\n\nAfter a brief silence, the poppy song Money begins with a cash register. The guitar solo here is also great. Us and Them is the best song on the album, and probably one of my favourite songs altogether. It is emotional, sad and brilliantly played.\n\nAny Colour You Like is probably the only part where it drags a bit. 3 minutes of similar guitar rhythm gets a bit tedious, but Brain Damage/Eclipse is a brilliant end to the album, featuring lyrics such as 'the lunatic is on the grass' 'the paper holds their folded faces to the floor/ and everyday the paper boy brings more'.\n\nA heartbeat continues faintly throughout the entire album, and you can actually hear it quite clearly on many songs. Overall, this album is brilliant and fantastic, and is my favourite album.""]",5.00 stars
chitramyqueen,"[""when i was a kid, my brother used to play this album all the time. he thought it was so cool. i was, alternately, freaked out by the woman screaming so much, nervous from all the alarms going off, or bored out of my mind. i never saw the appeal of this album back then.\n\nnow i'm an adult. the alarms no longer bother me. and the woman screaming no longer bothers me. in fact, these things are welcome now, they provide some of the more interesting sounds on dark side of the moon. there is still a lot of boredom connected with this album, interspersed with a lot of just ok stuff and the occasional rare periods of finer music. they could have left off us and them and eclipse. even time and the great gig in the sky are only ok, just 'good enough' but hovering on the border of tedium. there should have been a lot more like breathe and money and brain damage. then this album would have deserved the accolades it has received all this time. as it is, it just impresses me as music to be spaced out on valium with.\n\ni have to give this album credit for its time period, though. i guess it truly was innovative back then.""]",3.00 stars

notesofachord,"['I find the album to be a brilliant assessment of the loneliness, monotony, and insanity of living in the modern world. The album starts with ""Breathe"" which lyrically and musically is basically optimistic, but has hints of darkness to come. ""On the Run"" is pure paranoia - you can feel the threat of something, but you\'re not sure what. On ""Time"", the frustration that we all feel occasionally of life passing us by without accomplishing our goals is felt. The Breathe ""reprise"" offers a respite from the stress, but the loneliness and frustration returns with the epic ""Great Gig in the Sky"". ""Money"" is one of the all-time great sarcastic songs. We all want it, but it doesn\'t really make us happy. ""Us and Them"" is a questioning of the motives of warfare and human conflict. What really are the differences between opposing sides and who are they really fighting for? ""Any Colour You Like"" is escapist music - releasing us from the darkness of the previous songs. ""Brain Damage"" is genius in the sense that you can\'t tell if Mr. Waters (or his character in the album) is going insane or if everyone else is insane and are simply trying to get him to conform to their insane world. ""Eclipse"" is a bit of a pompous and overstated ending which on another album would be a disaster, but somehow works as a release from the bitterness and paranoia of the previous 40 minutes.\n\nSo, yeah, it\'s really good and I like it.']",5.00 stars

I could tell you that it\'s Wings\' Henry McCulloch saying ""I don\'t know, I was really drunk at the time"" at the end of ""Money"", but you probably already knew that. I could tell you about the connection between this and the Wizard of Oz movie, but that story has already been mentioned lots of times in previous reviews. It is also a well known fact the album spent 741 weeks on the Billboard album charts (or more than 14 years if you prefer). This was a birthday present for my 13th birthday and my first SACD 8 years later (bought on the day of release before I even had a player), but you probably aren\'t interested in reading that.\n\nSo what can I say here? I love this album, still just as much as I did when I first heard it. It is a timeless piece of music with some incredible highlights, most notably ""Breathe"", ""Time"", ""Money"", ""Us and them"" and ""Brain damage"". It has remained the ultimate concept album, none of the concept albums that followed come close to this one. Not even Roger Waters\' own The wall. When it comes to making all time favourite albums lists this album never makes it to the top 10. Probably just because I want to include some original choices instead of the same old shit that appears in every list. But in the end that\'s just unfair.

PINK FLOYD SUCKS. The best example of pink floyd\'s shittiness is the song ""another brick in the wall"". I bet it was written by a ten year old kid. Yes, you do need an education you morons. I hope those teachers do leave you alone so that no one will notice if I butchered the band members with a meat cleaver in their sleep, sell their entrails to a meat shop for a profit and spend the money on lava lamps and spacecakes, and guitars.

If you had a Floyd T-shirt, you were even cooler. Through sheer association of the stoner and this record or perhaps even ""classical conditioning"" for you fans of Pavlov, I avoided this album for a long time. Of course, I often heard ""Money"" and ""Us and Them"" on the radio and thought these were decent tunes.\n\nNow that high school is a quarter of a century behind me and my memories of the stoner throng are fading, I thought I might download this album and give it a listen with almost full objectivity.

Rhythms that, as simple as they were in 1973, held the power to move a person to tears with it\'s unequaled sense of psychological delirium. The melodies are unique, delightful and memorable, with a spark that makes us think about the joys of being alive, able to enjoy such songs.\n\nWith a dramatic start marked in the 2 part introduction, in ""Speak to me/Breathe "" we are immersed into the hallucinogenic trip that life represents. We are faced with the option of individuality or conformity: ""For long you live and high you fly, but only if you ride the tide, and balanced on the biggest wave, you race towards an early grave"".\nAnd that is just a small example of the profoundness of this musical wonder.\nThroughout the whole experience, the listener is exposed to varied beats, voices, even orchestrations, that add much value to the albums diversity.\nThe great thing about it is that this album has a song for you regardless of any mood you are in.\n\nAfter all ends, we are left with a slight anxiety to listen some more of that sensuous music... and may be the albums only problem: it\'s a tad short.

That isn\'t to say I dislike the album though, as I feel it is very good. ""Breathe"" and the coda of ""Brain Damage/Eclipse"" are perfect bookends, while ""The Great Gig In The Sky"" and ""On The Run"" provide the beautiful psychedelic experiments. The album has a nice trippy feel, but for me it is never empowering or hypnotic and so the album never really takes off. Aside from the aforementioned songs, the strange instrumental sections do little except add some atmosphere which the band prove they can give with more substantial tracks like ""Time"", so they are unnecessary and are longer than some of the more conventional tracks. Also, although ""Money"" is a great song, I think it sounds completely out of place here, with the vocals being slightly more aggressive than elsewhere.

They end too soon, they don\'t go anywhere, and they don\'t leave a lasting impression. It\'s like Birth of the Cool, good ideas at their rawest, far from reaching their potential.\n\nAnd then there\'s the sound effects. Every 30 seconds (or so it feels), there\'s a cash register ringing, a sample of a radio show, the sound of traffic, or whatever else. Not only do they serve as a great distraction to me, but it seems like the music was written to fit around them, not the other way around. I find the result both shallow and pretentious.\n\nI\'m still hard pressed to call it a bad album. There is nothing completely objectionable about it, except for the wailing banshee on The Great Gig in the Sky. Who thought that was a good idea? But all in all, this album is little more than a glimmer of hope that the band would eventually move on to create something really good.

The Dark Side of the Moon (closely trailed by Obscured by Clouds)\n\nI know it\'s unoriginal and maybe even trendy to say this, but The Dark Side of the Moon is over-rated. The concept is great; the execution of the concept, not so much. The songs become boring too easily if you aren\'t stoned, and if choose to be loaded, that\'s one thing, but if inebriation is required in order to fully grasp, enjoy, or appreciate the album, that\'s another. It\'s like going to a fast food restaurant where they give you the ingredients to make your own meal. That\'s not what I want! I want my sandwich made for me; that\'s the point! I don\'t want to have to take extra steps to get the utmost fulfillment out of a record. Truly great records do not require such things. And I know there are plenty of folks who still worship this album totally straight. That, I understand even less!\n\nGood album? Okay, I\'ll give it that. There are some cool parts, like ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" and most of ""Money"" (did we really need that cheesy-ass sax solo though?), and the ""Brain Damage""/""Eclipse"" finale is epic. And, like I said, the concept--brilliant! The music in itself is average. No one can deny that this album was immensely successful; but I will dispute its deification--it\'s hardly even one of Pink Floyd\'s best albums, much less one of the best albums ever!\n\nUpdate (6/25/2021): I wrote the above review as a 16-year-old high-schooler. Of the many somewhat cringe-worthy reviews of mine on this site from my angsty teenage years, it\'s one that I suppose is less cringeworthy, to me, than many others. Unfortunately, depending on how you view it, many of these such reviews were written about those gateway albums--the ones everyone must at least listen to before their opinion on anything can really be completely valid--like The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind before, or as, you laugh at the review I wrote 14 years ago, I was in high school. I was living in that strange but very real (at the time) environment in which your identity hinges so much on the interests you take up. Is it sports? Music? Academics? Whatever it is, chances are it\'s going to define you in the eyes of many, and perhaps your own eyes too. The Dark Side of the Moon, and in general, Pink Floyd, were among the things that people of a certain group clung to as a means of social identification. Most of them were white males with poor academics, little to no interest in athletics, and a rebellious streak, often expressed in some mixture of music and social drug use. Every single one of those guys had a Dark Side of the Moon t-shirt, and although many of them were friends and congenial acquaintances, it was sometimes fun to see how many such t-shirts you could spot over the course of a regular school day.\n\nI liked Pink Floyd at the time, but thought their over-representation as a social identifier was comically overblown, and I think it led to a resentment, and ultimately, to the aggressively distanced review above. I guess in short, it was low-hanging fruit to examine this album and sum it up less, or in my case, more with ""It\'s not that good."" I also associated it negatively with the people in my social circle who were constantly trying to get me to join them in their drug habits, which I was truthfully not interested in doing, and the social ramifications from that (probably more imagined by me than not) frustrated me--and I took it out in part in that review.\n\nAnother thing that made me resent this album in the past is that, as some of you RYM old-timers may remember, this album held the top-overall spot on the RYM top albums list for a long time back in the day. Even as much as I enjoy this album today, it\'s not the greatest of all time, but I bring this up because it\'s another reason that I remember resenting it, and felt the need to be iconoclastic in my initial review.\n\n-big sigh-\n\nNow that my explanation is over, I do want to take the next few minutes to say, no, it may actually be that good, indeed. I think perhaps a lot of people in my past only superficially liked this album because of the social reasons I\'ve tried to describe above, but if I really give it its due listen and forget all the social bullshit I associate with it, I see it--I see the true beauty there.\n\nWith more subjective and matured eyes, and more importantly, ears, I hear a truly magnificent, terrific album. The way it holds together, first of all, is what any concept albums should strive for. It\'s like a perfectly designed amusement park ride--all the loops and curves and ascents and descents are in the most perfect spots. Nothing feels wrong or improper--just the feeling that you\'re getting a temporary pass to explore the vast expanses of the erratic, insane mind, which is an ironic achievement by Pink Floyd, because this album is composed not from the perspective of the insane, but that of the onlookers who witnessed the tragic mental downfall of Syd Barrett. Authentic or not, their delivery just feels right and it\'s truly an amazing feat.\n\nThe main drawbacks of this album for me are the overuse of prerecorded spoken parts (e.g., ""cruisin\' for a bruisin\',"" ""short, sharp shock,"" etc.) and general synthy sonic effects. They\'re done about as tastefully as possible here, but there is only so much that can be done with it. You can serve Budweiser and call it a ""light lager,"" but it\'s still shitty beer no matter what you call it or how you present it, you follow? That\'s how I feel about the many synthy aspects of this album, which are most prominent on ""Speak to Me,"" ""On the Run"" (the aforementioned most tasteful usage), the bleh first half of ""Any Colour You Like,"" and the last bit of the otherwise flawless ""Brain Damage.""\n\nThe highlights are ""Time,"" ""The Great Gig in the Sky,"" and ""Brain Damage"" leading into the, as I described it years ago ""epic finale"" of ""Eclipse."" Each of these moments of the album possess the emotional power to bring me to tears upon any given listen, but especially in those rare but always relished moments where I can truly focus and submerge and listen to this entire album without interruption.\n\nThat\'s the kind of attention this album does not necessarily require, but deserves, so I hope that, whatever your existing prejudices about it or Pink Floyd may be, you can find the personal bandwidth to give it that much. I doubt you\'ll be disappointed.\n\n(Oh, and in case you\'re wondering, I\'d now slide this album into my top three Pink Floyd albums along with The Wall and Piper...)']",4.50 stars

The Rock music of the 1970s is better summed up here than in anything from the likes of Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath. The streamlined psychedelia, the guitar heroics, and quietly, the self-absorption, are all here. This is the perfection of all that Pink Floyd had been working toward. Due to all of it's prestige and importance, it's difficult to criticize The Dark Side of the Moon, but it's less groundbreaking than both The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and The Wall. It's also a little bit too perfect, a little too well contained. The emotion and adventure of some of Floyd's other albums is missing here.

pidgeonhead,"['Love it or hate it, you can\'t ignore it. Released in 1974, The Dark Side Of The Moon would go on to become the fastest selling British album ever and over 700 weeks in the billboard 200 album chart has ensured legendary status. Part of the legend comes from the innovate electronic element to this album which would in time, dominate the future pop world. Underneath the chiming clocks and space age noises is an album of only seven actual songs (and a reprise) which leaves little room for error.\n\nThe experience begins with the electronics of ""Speak To Me"" which fails to make any real impression before we arrive at the very fine ""Breathe"". ""Breathe"" is akin to the grace of a bird in flight, as it soars and hovers above the listener but is then unfortunately followed by what feels like half an hour of irritating experimental sounds including several alarm clocks before we finally reach the excellent ""Time"" which is worth waiting for. After stating in ""Breathe"" that ""For long you live and high you fly"", ""Time"" deals with the sudden, painful realisation that you\'ve wasted your life while time crept upon you or in the songs words ""you missed the starting gun"".\n\n""The Great Gig In The Sky"" is where the problems start. A minor chorded piano intro gives way to a highly talented female vocalist who then unleashes the vocal equivalent of a car alarm, sounding either plain crazy or on some kind of powerful stimulant. Thankfully, at the 2:27 mark, this bizarre form of ""entertainment"" appears to draw to a close until, to my eternal misery, she launches into another series of it, albeit of a more muted variety. I\'m sorry to say that this comes across as nothing more than pretentoius drivel and is insufferable to say the least. The sound of a cash register aptly introduces ""Money"" in which Roger Waters vents his socialist fury, with the lines ""Money, it\'s a crime"" and ""They say is the root of all evil today"". Quite ironic when you consider the large fortune he acquired after this (David Gilmour) rant. A solid enough track it may be, but spanning it over seven minutes is wholly un-necessary.\n\n""Us And Them"" is along similar lines, dealing with the reasons that seperate ""ordinary men"" be it wealth, colour or nationality and the petty squables that cause such serious consequences. ""Any Colour You Like"" is an average instumental which\'s main funtion is linking ""Us And Them"" to the album\'s real saving grace, the spectacular ""Brain Damage"". After covering most aspects of life on the previous tracks, ""Brain Damage"" obviously deals with mental breakdown and features some quite sublime lyrics including ""You throw away the key, there\'s someone in my head but it\'s not me. Also interesting, is the ""remembering games and daisy chains and laughs"" line, which is perhaps dedicated to Syd Barrett.\n\n""Brain Damage"" is followed by ""Eclipse"" which despite being listed as a separate track is really the bridge to the previous number and makes for a highly climactic finish. All in all, this is generally an overrated album with only three (perhaps four) songs which can be classified as being truly special. Unfortunately, this is generally more style than substance and more good songs with less special effects is what\'s desired. This is by no means Pink Floyd\'s best album, but still has moments of fleeting brilliance.']",3.00 stars

It touches on daunting matters with such ease, poise, and empathy which really made an impression on me as a child. The mood and atmosphere are great throughout and complement the songwriting to make it very easy on the ears.\n\nNow on to the weaknesses; which become increasingly evident with time. Namely, the 'savior of humanity' sense of self-importance which is unfortunately a true reflection of Roger Waters' character. I'm also genuinely puzzled by how what once seemed like the greatest thing ever now sounds more formulaic and mechanical than creative. Being very accessible yet sounding talented and profound, this was the ultimate album for mainstream ears, which explains the enormous popularity it has achieved over the years. It's not that Pink Floyd were the first to come up with these ideas or incorporate them into music; it's that they managed to reach enough people to create that impression. When it comes down to it, Dark Side of the Moon's flaws ultimately stand out just as much as its strengths to the avid listener.\n\nNevertheless, it did once have a major impact on me once and I can't deny that. Whether the album opened my floodgates of independent existential thought, or triggered a release of empathy, or merely caught me in the right place at the right time, (by now I'm inclined to believe it's mostly the latter) Dark Side of the Moon embodies a phase in my life that I won't forget.""]",3.50 stars

Esa fue la versión corta.\n\nUna de mis pocas convicciones en cuanto a la música es que existe solo un crítico totalmente fiable: El Tiempo. Y la mayor prueba que debe atravesar todo disco es el del paso del tiempo. Es la prueba última. Se pueden decir muchas cosas hoy en día de un disco salido ayer, pero solo el tiempo, despiadado por naturaleza, borra lo inutil y recuerda lo imprescindible, lo importante. Hoy en día, \'\'Dark Side of the Moon\'\', con sus casi 35 años (1973), sigue conmoviendo, emocionando y volando las cabezas de las nuevas generaciones en la era del ringtone y los Black Eyed Peas. Hoy en día, Dark Side of the Moon, sigue sonando tan progresivo, tan experimental, tan... cargado de una fuerza única, emotiva, casi mística, trascendental, como fue hace 34 años. Por supuesto, siempre estaran los puristas que diran que Wish You Were Here es un disco mucho mejor o que la mejor etapa de Floyd es la de Barret o la de Meedle. Tal vez tengan razon, pero ¿que importa?. Creo que Dark Side of the Moon es el mejor álbum de la historia simplemente porque condensa en palabras y sonidos mortales el nacimiento, la vida, el amor, la locura, el tiempo y el inevitable final. Todo lo que hace a la vida humana en poco más de 40 minutos. Y de una forma tan hermosa que es dificil describirla y mucho más imitarla. Dark Side of the Moon esta lleno de grandes letras, todos himnos de esos que conmueven el corazón. La música es el resultado obvio de las letras, despues de todo, algo tan complejo como la vida no puede ser retratado de una forma simple. Es en la música, el verdadero alma de este arte, donde yace el corazón (que nace con el comienzo del disco y termina con un último latido en ""Eclipse"") del álbum. Desde los coros celestiales de ""Us & Them"" a la psicodelia de ""Any Color You Like"" el disco atraviesa todos los colores del prisma, simbolo inconfundible del álbum. Y todo está tan cargado de un \'\'pesimismo\'\', un sentido de \'\'trascendencia\'\' que solo los más fans de Tool dicen encontrar.\n\nComo dije, creo que toda persona debería escuchar alguna vez \'\'Dark Side of the Moon\'\' en la soledad y oscuridad.

inpraiseoffolly,"['I debated for a long time whether this was a 4 or 5 star album. On one hand, it has more weak points than any other album I have given 5 stars. On the other hand, it is arguably more influential than any other album I have given 5 stars. And it certainly has no bad songs. But, I have decided that this is not quite a masterpiece of progressive music. I’ll settle for 4.5 stars.\nThe album, like Wish You Were Here (to come two years later), was partly inspired by Syd Barrett\'s insanity. The album is a concept album (what else could it be) about the various factors in life that lead to insanity (namely Time, Money, Death [great gig in the sky], War [Us and Them]), eventually culminating in the protagonist going insane (Brain Damage). The last song, however, makes us realize that in reality, everyone is insane.\nThe title of the album comes from the word lunatic. Broken down, this word comes from luna (which means moon) and tic (involuntary muscular contraction). Thus, a lunatic, at least as was assumed in ancient times, is a person who has seizures based on the cycle of the moon. Thus, the Dark Side of the Moon is the part that makes a person go insane. On Eclipse, when it says (faintly, near the end), ""There is no dark side of the moon, really. Matter of fact, it\'s all dark,"" this means that each and every one of us is insane.\nThe album opens with Speak to Me (in some releases, this is combined with the next track, Breathe). This is a short opening, combining sound effects used in Eclipse, Us and Them, Money, Time, Brain Damage (the laugh), finally culminating of the screams of Great Gig in the Sky. This transitions perfectly into Breathe, a song about being born into a harsh world, that will eventually cause you to go insane. Just listen to the lyrics (and the great music, too).\nOn the Run is a track made using (at the time) revolutionary technology, though I\'m not exactly sure what this was. It\'s about paranoia, where a man is running to get to his plane, which he misses (and it\'s fortunate he does, as the plane crashes at the end). However, this near death experience increases his paranoia and causes him to worry about death (explored later in Great Gig in the Sky).\nTime, the next track, is the best on the album. From the great clock introduction, to the amazing lyrics (some of Waters\'s best), to the great guitar solo by Gilmour, this track has it all. This is one of Pink Floyd\'s finest songs. It\'s about how a man wastes his life away getting nothing done, then finds out that he\'s old and doesn\'t have the agility to do all that he missed. This is only the ""Time"" part of the song. Then Breathe Reprise kicks in. The person from the beginning of the song comes home, and hears funeral bells ringing. They are for some other person just like him that kicked back and watched the years fly by. The man (from the beginning of the song) realizes that it will be him next. And that some other guy will hear his funeral bells and realize the same thing. It\'s a never ending cycle. Of course, by the time anyone gets the message, it\'s too late to do anything about it for you, and young people won\'t listen if you advise them. So the cycle is doomed to go on endlessly (this was my interpretation of the song on songmeanings.net, a great site, by the way). This is truly an amazing track.\nNext up is The Great Gig in the Sky. I have never cared for it, the screaming irritates me, but the spoken words in the background (and the same goes for the rest of the album) are really insightful, and really lift up the song. That, and the keyboards are great. That helps, too. Money comes after, and, I don\'t know how I figured this out, but it\'s about obsession with money (not having enough, does your neighbor have more, etc). The lyrics are, as always, intelligent, and the music is engaging throughout. You have to love the lines, ""money, it\'s a crime, share it fairly/and don\'t take a slice of my pie,"" and ""money, so they say/is the root of all evil today."" And the main draw is: how many hit songs on the radio are done in 7/4 time (as money is)? And the sax solo. That\'s great, too. Come to think of it, it\'s all great.\nUs and Them is the ""power"" song on the album. This is the song that really makes you feel. The imagery of soldiers, heading out to kill people they don\'t even know, based on orders they don\'t understand, for reasons they are not told, is much more emotional than any ""you left me/what can I do now/I want to move on/but I don\'t know how"" pop songs (yes, I did write that, and in about 10 seconds, which shows about how much skill you need to write pop songs, at least the lyrical bit). Yes, it\'s slow, but if it were fast, it would carry no weight. Any Colour You Like is about the pressures society exerts on you to conform (think Henry Ford: ""any colour you like, so long as it\'s black""). It\'s a truly beautiful instrumental, and a real gem.\nFinally, the protagonist breaks down, and becomes a lunatic (it is interesting to note that ""the lunatic is on the grass"" refers to a park in London where there are keep off the grass signs, and Gilmour thought anyone who disobeyed them would have to be crazy - thanks to the wonderful people at songmeanings.net for this insight). The song furnishes the line ""dark side of the moon,"" from which the album takes its name. This song is a clear reference to Syd Barrett (""and if the band you\'re in starts playing different tunes/I\'ll see you on the dark side of the moon,"" - this is a clear reference to Syd Barrett, at the height of his troubles, would simply play one note during Pink Floyd concerts, or, even worse, simply detune his guitar). Then we morph flawlessly into the closer, Eclipse, which takes us out with a bang, eventually returning to the heartbeat that introduces Speak to Me. And then we hear the voice, ""there\'s no dark side of the moon really, matter of fact, it\'s all dark."" And then it\'s heartbeats to the end. A truly marvelous album.\nPros: intelligent lyrics, great music, great flow, superb production, groundbreaking technology, influential\nCons: On the Run and Great Gig in the Sky are weak tracks (at least to me, many people see Great Gig as the best on the album), way too popular to be the best ever\nThis album is highly recommended to anyone who likes good music. That\'s all there is to it. If you like great guitar work, excellent lyrics, engaging music, and a true experience, that\'s what this album provides. And yes, it is meant to be listened to from beginning to end, as the tracks are much more powerful that way than on their own. Not the best album ever, but up there.']",4.50 stars
Bitterman,"[""Love it: Breathe, Time, Money, Us and Them\n\nHate it: none\n\nOf course its a classic, but of course it's completely overrated. The reputation far exceeds the album in the sense that if you don't enjoy the album then others may feel there must be something wrong with you. I remember when I first listened to it I couldn't work out what the big deal was. I know it's a cliche but it's true to say it grows on you. It's appeal must also be attributed to the fact it is pseudo prog - prog for the mainstream - most listeners wouldn't be able to get into bands like King Crimson let alone some of the tougher prog bands.\n\nThe album has almost perfect structure with many funny quotes from the recorded interviews. The songs segue almost effortlessly into each other creating a brilliant atmosphere (mind you, this skill is in no way unique - many prog and other art rock bands had the ability to do the same). Anyway 'Breathe' and 'Time' are classics and there is no surprise that 'Breathe' is reprised at the end of 'Time' as the two belong together. 'On the Run' separates them which was probably heaps of fun to create at the time but it has kind of dated, although I love the disturbing laugh near the end and the airport PA announcements. 'Money' is another classic, but this one is seriously overplayed on the radio. 'Us and Them' is my favourite track on the album - such a lush atmosphere with stately saxophone. The album does fall a bit towards the end - 'Any Colour You Like' is probably the only throwaway on the album, 'Brain Damage' is quite a cool song but relies a bit on the annoying harmonies on the refrain and 'Eclipse' is hardly a song. Still this is definitely an album that works better than the sum of its parts.""]",5.00 stars

tomlavan,"[""Released in 1973, DSOTM is one of those timeless albums that transcends its time and influence over 30 years later. It is impossible to think of any release before or after it that sounds anything like it. Perhaps nobody has attempted to replicate it, or perhaps nobody can, but DSOTM certainly holds a special place in musical history, defining a genre as much as it made one.\n\nmost Floyd fans will know all too well that Syd Barrett had left the group well before this album, and many will argue that Pink Floyd was Syd's machine, but here the remaining members hold their own and create an all seeing, all sounding, ever present masterpiece that became one of the most highly rated and best selling albums of all time. Those who have not heard it before will no doubt be surprised on first listen, as DSOTM is not centrally an album of singles, but more of one continual piece of music, much like the album centrefold. (which also became an iconic image, synonymous with Pink Floyd)\n\nSo, the music itself. Starting with heartbeats, and ending with heartbeats, the concept album deals with powerful human issues like death, illness, drugs, time (or the fragility of it) and money. many of the songs feature large guitar layering, and some of the most incredible synthesiser effects ever recorded (see 'Any Colour You Like'). In particular, 'The Great Gig in the Sky' features Claire Torry's beautiful, shattering screaming all the way through, making the song so much more powerful than words. No disrespect to the lyrics though, and lines like 'Balancing on the biggest wave/Heading toward an early grave' really make you think.\n\nIf you haven't heard this album before, I would really recommend you to at some point in your life. DSOTM is one of those rare albums that bring together everything people want to hear, and create something nobody has heard. It is a truly classic album. It may not be life changing anymore, but it is certainly life affirming, which in this day and age, may just be better.""]",5.00 stars

Morak99,"['Atmosphere. This one single word is what is The Dark Side of the Moon all about. Released in 1973 at the peak of the progressive rock age, it sums up everything the movement was about into one unified, driven, and beautifully executed work of genius. The lyrics, the music, the sound effects, the mood, the flow, they all add up to an atmosphere.\n\nPeople often complain about ""Money"" breaking up the flow of the record, and I guess it does a little, but the hell with that. It may not be subtle in its mesage, but whatever. Great bass riff, great sax solo, great song. But that\'s far from the only thing on offer on The Dark Side of the Moon. There\'s the floating pulse that makes up ""Breathe"", the ethereal splitting vocal of ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", the plodding beat of ""Us and Them"" tying right into its anti-military message, the rocking solo of ""Time"", the forceful climax of ""Eclipse"". Wright\'s keyboards make for a base, upon which Waters, Mason, and Gilmour build into a single driving atmosphere. You can tell this is serious stuff just by the feel. For an album so heavily about the choices we all make in life, they made the right choices in so many ways. The layers of instruments all sit in a perfect balance. The lyrics, while deep on one hand, are simplistic and accessible on the other. Nothing lasts too long, nothing is too quick. This record has a certain panache, enfolding the listener in its sounds, pulling them towards its lyrics and music. Pink Floyd had always been about the sounds, and never would they better their sound then right here.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is an absolutely essential album. I won\'t go so far to say as there\'s nothing like it, but it is a special album in its absolute excellence at what it wants to do. One of my all time favorites.']",5.00 stars

In fact, I\'ve only felt ""Money"" fit the bill when watching it with ""The Wizard of Oz."" When that door opens, ka-ching, baby. That\'s some fine quality synching right there.\n\n""Time"" is about as classic as it gets. In fact, this is all about as classic as it gets, but there seems to be (with me, anyways) one song from a Pink Floyd album that just ends up sticking with you, and ""Time"" is that song. Maybe it\'s because it\'s such a glorious pulse-lengthening opening into a great riffy song, but I just can\'t think of another song that just stays with me like ""Time"" does.\n\nAnd this is one of those albums where you really need to listen to it all the way through to enjoy it. This is a non-stop flight, really; one 43 minute song split up into 10 ideas and the cuts are where the ideas shift. It just sounds better hearing it all flow together as opposed to listening to seperate cuts. Must hear stuff, but not the greatest album of all time, either.']",4.50 stars

Even the most acclaimed instrumental track ""Great Gig In The Sky"" is annoying, in spite of a good piano part, because it\'s too repetitive and the singer Clare Torry ad-libs without creativity and her affected interventions are inopportune.\n\nOne word about the sound.

nessonic,"[""The quintessential album for any Pink Floyd fan who hasn't exactly full examined their discography (or the average rock fan and pothead).\n\nEasily their most simplistic record, and the one void of the signature Pink Floyd atmosphere. Catchy hooks like Money are perfect for radio hits but on a record they are soon forgotten.\n\nThe least benefactor is how overrated this is. This album is praised and heard so much that it tears down whatever meaning it originally had in 1973. Before it blew up, it was an okay rock album, a sub par Pink Floyd record; not the perfect classic it is now considered. There aren't many standout tracks here outside of On the Run because it's the closest to the atmosphere they used to create, not the soulless radio tunes.\n\nI bought this as a teen, because of course, it was the greatest album evar. Spun it a couple times, then didn't pick it up for a long time. In that period I became acquainted with their other material and I found why I didn't want to stick Dark Side back in again, I've heard it enough already- it has no depth. Past those first few hearings, nothing brings me back to it. Not that I need to, I hear the singles on the radio damn near enough, and most of the other songs weren't that great in the first place.\n\nThe fun comes from idiosyncrasies like watching it with Wizard of Oz and seeing it performed live in its entirety (ever hear about Think Floyd coming round your place, check them out).

It always seemed pretty pompous to me, but mostly, it contained nothing that seemed to connect to me in any way.\n\nCriticism of capitalism? Blah. Fear of time running out? Nah. Fear of getting mad? Well, kind of, but I was always too much of a hypochondriac to listen to an album that might make it even worse.\n\nWorse, the album doesn\'t have any melodies that express any kind of emotionality. I only got this album because I was deep into Alan Parsons at the time and heard that this was way better than anything he had made with his Project later on. Problem is, I always felt that the production and the synth effects on Dark Side were pretty laughable. ""On the Run""? ""Great Gig in the Sky""? ""Any Colour You Like""? Come on, this is supposed to be a rock album, and the fact that many other British bands were also releasing misguided attempts to turn themselves into opera stars is hardly an excuse, especially as the Pink Floyd albums that preceded and followed Dark Side are all more than decent.\n\nI won\'t use the O-word here, for there must be something that allows millions of people to identify with the music on this album. In his scathing review of the album for the book Kill Your Idols, Burt Gilyard explains it thus: ""The lyrics are so vague and abstract that they are without doubt universally applicable. If you ever feel alienated, Pink Floyd is there for you"".\n\nSince I had a big penchant for pompous music in my youth, my only explanation for my total inability to connect to this album in any way is that I probably never felt alienated enough.

When I had the vinyl releases my stereo equipment was all that a teenager making minimum wage could afford at the time of the albums release.

Mr_Music,"['Pink Floyd-Dark Side of the Moon\n\nOne day several years ago, I went digging through my father\'s huge shelf of CD\'s. I found a lot of things I have never grown to like, but I did find this one album. I always liked the cover as a child, but now that I am older, I have come to experience the music. And I will say, if you are a fan of any kind of rock music and do not already own this album, shame on you. The music is simply amazing. Much of it cannot be described in words. The stunning lyrics of ""Time"" and the addictive beat of ""Money"" are some highlights of this record. ""Us and Them"", my personal favorite, begins with gentle drums and trumpet, leading up to soft lyrics, then, before you know it, bursting into a simply stunning chorus. The well-known ""Great Gig in the Sky"" is something that you must hear. Although no actual lyrics, the woman\'s voice is amazing. Listening to this song in the dark, late at night, with no other sounds, will put you in a different state of mind. In conclusion, this album, is fantastic, musical, emotionally, and lyrically.\n\nRecommended Tracks (All of them are nearly perfect, these are just my personal favorites):\n-Time\n-Money\n-Us and Them\n-Brain Damage\n-Great Gig In The Sky\n\nOverall Rating: 5/5']",5.00 stars

Xplorer,"['El mejor disco de Floyd??? difícil responder algo como eso, sin embargo estamos hablando de un disco que sin duda alguna se tiene que mencionar bien alto a la hora de hablar de la historia del rock, tanto por su influencia como por su calidad musical. La temática del álbum incluye el conflicto, la avaricia, el envejecer y la enfermedad mental, éste último inspirado en parte por el deterioro mental de Syd. Todo es perfecto en este álbum, su producción musical estuvo a cargo del prestigioso ingeniero de sonido Allan Parson y Roger Waters da los primeros indicios de dictadura compositiva y creativa dentro de la banda tomándole la posta al gran Syd Barret.\nPero entremos en detalle, cada pieza de ésta monumental obra del art/rock progresivo, tiene una amplia gama de luz, un espectro de sonidos, impresionantes solos de saxos con espectaculares coros (The Great Gig in the Sky), efectos de audio innovadores (On the Run), Time, Money, Us and Them (mi favorita del disco), Any Colour You Like, Brain Damage y Eclipse...nada sobra ni nada falta...Un Clásico por donde se le vea.']",5.00 stars

Being the outgoing person I am, I decided to pick it off the library shelf and listen to it. At first, the only song I really liked was Money. Listening to it a second time, I started to realize the genius of the album with songs like ""Time,"" ""Us and Them"", ""Brain Damage"", and ""Eclipse."" I also like how the album includes many background sounds in all the songs. It also has a great ending with songs like ""Brain Damage"" (I\'ll see on the dark side of the moon) and ""Eclipse"" (all that you touch, all that you see, etc.) All the other songs on the album are worth listening to, especially since it feels like all the songs on this album keep building up on each other.\n\nThere are some people who don\'t like this album because of the length of the songs, it\'s stoned out, it has a slow pace, etc. If you ever get out this album, don\'t expect it to be one that you\'ll dance your butt off to. It\'s really more of an album that has excellent rhythm and guitar riffs, but it requires patience if you\'re new to Pink Floyd.\n\nDefinitely recommended.

savoytruffle,"['More than 30 years after its release, Dark Side of the Moon remains a landmark achievement in popular music. Artistically it succeeds on many different levels. First off it\'s a \'concept\' album with a theme running more or less all the way through it. Secondly, it has some brilliant songs on it, like ""Breathe in the Air"", ""Time"" and ""Brain Damage"". Then there are abundant moments of sheer musical magic - in ""Time"", ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", ""Money"", ""Us and Them"" and ""Any Colour You Like"". Added to this we have some interesting experimentation with sound effects - most of it very successful. But the most enduring quality is that, even with the familiarity that comes with knowing something for 30 years, there is still an element of mystery to it.\n\n""Time"" is one of my favourite tracks, so I\'ll single it out for some special attention. It starts appropriately with a cacophony of clocks striking the hour, then Mason conjures up a brilliant couple of minutes of different percussive instruments ticking the time away in their different ways, accompanied by Waters\' bass with Wright\'s synthesizer and Gilmour\'s guitar somewhere in the background. Forget all those naff drum solos, this is the kind of creativity all percussionists should be striving for. Then Mason\'s drums lead in the other instruments and the vocals for what is one of Waters\' best songs. Gilmour contributes the perfect guitar solo to complete a stunning track.\n\nIt\'s difficult for the rest of the album to achieve the great heights of this song. Yet, here and there it happens - maybe not for a whole song, but for a good few bars at least. Dick Parry\'s contributions on saxophone certainly help. If you haven\'t treated yourself to this, I can only recommend that you do. It\'s one of the most rewarding albums in my collection. I never tire of it - not even after 30 years.']",5.00 stars

Now I am terrible for listening to new music, I prefer to enjoy what I know, but I was temporarily bored of Bowie (Heaven forbid that should happen too often); so I tried this again.\n\nTry to imagine it- the sun, the sound of the waves filling the few silences between tracks, a couple of ice-cold beers...

mbrafford,"['Pink Floyd get huge commercial success with this much appreciated work. A droomy work of art with good lyrics, great melodies and guitar work. To start off this album ""Speak To Me/Breathe"" has a trippy kind of introduction to _Dark Side Of The Moon_ which is basically a heart beat after heart beat. A great song to begin. ""On The Run"" is the first real song of the album with an excellent guitar mood to it. Followed by ""Time"" which sounds like an old arcade or Atari game. Maybe it was just their experiment with sounds and psychedelia. For the most part though the first three songs don\'t have much lyrics. They are still enjoyable and fun though. ""Great Gig In The Sky"" is one of my favorite tracks from the entire album and kept the sonic waves steady and fun. Then you you have ""Money"" and it starts with the sound of a cash register opening and closing over and over again. I was even able to see the video on VH1 CLASSIC which shows the making of _Dark Side Of The Moon_. It plays the song in the background while factories are sealing records. You don\'t even see the band members just the cover of the album being pushed by this machine continuously. Great song though.\n""Brain Damage"" is the best song on the entire album.

thefinalcut_,"['Dark Side of the Moon is an album by Pink Floyd that was released in 1973. The album is one of the best selling albums of all time, and is considered to be one of the best albums ever. It is a concept album about the troubles of living, such as money, time, death, drugs, and a couple more things.\n\nThe album starts off with ""Speak to Me/Breathe."" The song starts off quite, but then slowly grows louder as you hear many of the sound effects that are found later in the album. Then, ""Breathe"" starts with a calming guitar riff and later haunting vocals, which sets the mood for the rest of the album. ""Breathe"" is thought to be about being born into the world, which is possible since you can hear heartbeats at the beginning of ""Speak to Me.""\n\nAfter the last line in ""Breathe,"" the next track entitled ""On the Run"" begins. This is an instrumental that is about the troubles of traveling. This is probably one of the first techno-ish tracks ever recorded. In the song, you can hear an announcement that sounds like it\'s coming from an airport. Before this, though, you can hear fast footsteps, as if someone was running in an airport to catch a flight. At the end, you can hear an explosion, which is thought to be the plane that the man missed. The explosion lingers on, and then into the next song...\n\n...Which is called ""Time."" In my opinion, this is the most powerful song on the whole album. The song begins with many alarm clocks sounding, which then goes into a short little interlude before the vocals begin (which are shared by David Gilmour and Richard Wright, this being one of the few songs that the latter sings on). This song is about the worries of time passing by quickly, as you could probably tell by the title. At around the middle of the song, a powerful guitar solo starts, and then the vocals come in again. The song is calm, yet has a side to it that shouts ""I\'m not done!!"" until the song goes into ""Breathe - Reprise."" This basically ""Breathe,"" except with more lyrics.\n\nAfter ""Breathe - Reprise"" is done, ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" begins. This is a piano-driver instrumental song, which is about death. There are opera-like vocals that sound like screaming, except more calm. The screaming gets louder, and then dies down a bit. The piano slows down a bit, but the vocals grow louder, then softer again. Everything becomes quite, and then the song is over.\n\nThe next song is ""Money."" This song, as you can again tell by the title, is about the worries of money, and how it\'s ""the root of all evil."" Also on another note, this song is unique from the other songs on the album because most of it is in 7/4 time, the regular being 4/4. The song begins with sounds of money clashing and cash registers opening and closing and and other sorts of money-related sounds. Then, the extremely catchy bass line comes in, followed by the drums and then the guitar, and finally the vocals. Later into the song, there comes a saxaphone solo, followed directly by a guitar solo. During the guitar solo, though, the song is immediately switched to 4/4 time, and as soon as it\'s over, they switch back to 7/4. The rest of the vocals come in, and the song finishes with people talking in the background (which is actually in every song; Pink Floyd were interviewing people about what they thought about a particular subject, in this case money).\n\n""Money"" then fades off and goes into the next track, ""Us and Them."" This song is about war, and has beautiful lyrics. It feels like a dream when you listen to this song, it\'s that calm (especially for a song about war). Near the end, it gets louder, then fades off into the next song. There\'s not really much else to say about this song, except that it\'s great.\n\nThe next song is another instrumental, called ""Any Colour You Like."" The song is probably about how we always have so many choices, and how we take everything for granted. This is probably one of my favourite Pink Floyd songs, due to it showing off David Gilmour\'s awesome guitar techniques. This is probably also my favourite instrumental song ever. The song starts off kind of psychedelic-ish with some cool keyboard sounds, then goes trippy and the guitar starts. It gets slower, then fades off into...\n\n""Brain Damage"". This song is kind of a tribute to Syd Barrett, since the song is about dealing with disorders and drugs, which is what Barrett suffered from. The singer talks about how there is a ""lunatic"" everywhere he is, such as ""in the hall"" and ""in my head."" The song is also kind of psychedelic-ish, and and the end it bridges with the following song.\n\n""Eclipse,"" the last track on the album, is simply fantastic. It is basically a continuation from ""Brain Damage,"" and a great finisher for the album. At the end, you can hear the heartbeats that were once audible in the beginning of ""Speak to Me,"" which signals that the person\'s life is over.\n\nOverall, this is a great album, and one of the best of all time. Definitely worth a listen.']",5.00 stars

Mentalist,"[""Pink Floyd's commercial and creative peak. Probably. Certainly one of their most debated works and some would say, an all-time classic.\n\nI'd agree with them, too. The 42 minutes that this album occupies becomes a geniune journey. Opening with a wee little intro that charges into the album's first standout track. Breathe being a fantastic little song that spews out a delightful summer melody. It's also a track that seems to give the album a gentle-ish beginning.\n\nTime strikes me as another of the album's genuine jems. Coming after the just plain weird On the Run, in which tape loops are fiddled with to provide a driving, strangely tense product. That's clearly a note of Pink Floyd's invention. Anyway, back to Time which is, oddly enough, about Time. Cue clocks going off and a lovely, more intense song than Breathe. It's a nicely guitar-driven effort with quite a memorable solo stuffed in it.\n\nGreat Gig in the Sky being a vocal rollercoaster with a piano backdrop. I'm not a fan of it, but a lot of fans tend to link this as one of their favourites. Money following that as the bluesy effort that became the album's single. Weird time signature, for such a hit but it fits it like a glove.\n\nTo me, the album's flagship is Us and Them. An absolutely outstanding crescendo of piano chords punctuated by loud, breif vocal and guitar moments. I bloody love that song. In fact, there's not a song on this record I dislike. Great Gig in the Sky comes close, but it's not as bad as I like to think it is.\n\nThe latter stages of the record wind down nicely with Brain Damage, the song about mad people and Eclipse, the rousing finisher to what quite is the best album I own.\n\nIt peaks and troughs and marks the moment Pink Floyd reached their peak.""]",5.00 stars

Yes, it\'s a masterpiece, and it\'s probably The Pink Floyd\'s best work (and it has some STIFF competition). The beautiful ""Speak to Me/Breathe"" opens the album up and is reprised later. The albums centerpiece is the trio ""Time"", ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" (with, hands down, the best vocals of any song in history provided by Clare Tory), and ""Money"". The former and the latter feature David Gilmour with some memorable guitar solos, and Roger Water\'s lyrics are as poignant as they would ever be. The album never slows down after that point - ""Us and Them"" is smooth and majestic; it is contrasted to outstanding effect by its companion instrumental jam, ""Any Colour You\'d Like"", a definite high point of the entire work. Dark Side of the Moon climaxes with ""Brain Damage"" and its segue into the euphoric ""Eclipse"". Listening to this album straight through should give anyone chills, no matter how many times you may have heard it on the radio or on record.']",4.50 stars

I tried to listen to the music rather than analyse, critique or even think about it too much (maybe _Dark Side of the Moon_ is for morons). Just relax; I’m glad I found the magic of this record.\n\nTaking tracks 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, out of context isn’t a very clever thing to do. This album should appreciated as a body of work rather than segregate-able rock and roll songs.

degenbd,"['The Dark Side of the Moon was released by Pink Floyd in 1973 as a concept album dealing with the pressures of Time, Money, War, Paranoia, and Mental Illness. The album has become the second best selling album of all time selling more then forty million copies worldwide. The album is classified as a psychadellic rock genre with mixes of electronic music and blues. The songs by themselves are not to impressive but the album in it\'s entirity is quite fascinating. The songs intertwine with each other so perfectly that the album seems like it is just one massive song. Read on for song deconstruction.\n\n\n\nThe album starts off much like human life: A simple human heartbeat. The first song is interjected with ""Speak to Me/Breathe"" a pure soothing psychadellic rock song. The tone of the song is so calming and peaceful with the gentle noises of guitars as well as keyboards. Water\'s voice fits so perfectly with the passive music and the carefully coordinated lyrics fit the song like a glove.\n\nThe second song is ""On The Run"" which is a fast paced electronic pyschadellic rock song with consistent beats. The song is entirely instrumental with faint placed background sounds such as people conversing, a person running, and a brief sound of an airplane flying. The song in retrospect is just a keyboard repeating the same keys with awkward electronic noises placed in the song. The song ends with a huge crashing noise.\n\nWhen you hear a an alarm clock ticking the track has switched over to ""Time"". After several more ticks the alarm clock will ring and many clocks as well as buzzers ring to. The music starts out with a dark tone of keyboard sounds. The song then moves into different eclectic drums beating as the dark keyboard noises continue. Around the two and half minute period the music picks up with Waters voice being introduced to the song as well as the other rock and roll instruments. The song is quite depressing with the background vocals of people humming and borderline whining. David Gilmour\'s solo is very impressive and Waters voice coordinates with the song flawlessly. The song like the previous one\'s is a psychadellic rock song with Waters singing about the pressures of time and how it effects the entire human existence.\n\nThe next song is ""The Great Gig in the Sky"". This song is so simplistic, but also so beautiful. The song starts off with some background electronic keyboards sounds but quickly moves into the main focus of a piano playing. Even the graceful piano playing is unmatched to the female vocalist in the song. The voice of this woman which is so powerful, so moving, and sadening creates the song on her own. Throughout the song she only whines with no words at all, her whining is so intense at points that every other instrument can\'t even be heard. Other times her voice is is more calming and complements the piano perfectly. The song wraps up nicely with her vocals and the piano fading in the background.\n\nCa-Ching, Tear, Plop, Ring. This is the beginning of ""Money"". Certainly the biggest hit off the album has a catchy beat to it. The song sounds jazzy with blues sounds incorporated using the guitar, saxophone and keyboard. The song flows nicely together with two raw solos. The first is the saxophone solo which adds the blues factor to the song. The second is the raw rifts of David Gilmour on the guitar which immediately follows the saxophone. The lyrics are creatively put together as the song focuses on money and how it reacts with greed among the human species. The end of the song fades into a blissful background noise of keyboards.\n\nThe blissful noise continues and a slow, steady drum beat begins. This song is ""Us and Them"". This is one of the most soothing and relaxing songs I have ever heard. Waters voice is relaxing on the ears as he practically whispers the most basic opposite lyrics you will hear. The saxophone is also very relaxing which is quite ironic because it was raw and intense in ""Money"". The song continues and the piano begins to pick up and then the song blissfully explodes into intense piano and raw saxophone. The song continues repeating the slow soothing sounds with the exploding course for about four minutes.\n\nWhen you begin to hear the very weird soft techno keyboard noises the song has switched to ""Any Colour You Like"". This song is still very good but I consider it the weakest point of the album. The uber funky keyboard noises allow the song to be creative with some raw guitar playing by David Gilmour. The song can be considered a burst of funky keyboard creativity. The song is purely instrumental and kept short.\n\nThe song changes to a lighter tone of steady taping and a soft background. The song has switched to ""Brain Damage"" which is a slow psychadellic rock song. Throughout the song weird voices keep popping up as background noise. The song is kept simple but the melody tune of the keyboard and Waters voice keep you entranced within the song.\n\nWhen the guitar begins to pick up and the drums begin to crash the song has switched to ""Eclipse"". This is a great ending song with carefully placed lyrics that end the album with grace. The tone of the song once again is psychadellic rock with weird electronic keyboard noises with background vocals of the woman on ""Great Gig in the Sky"". And the lyrics are as follows\n\nAll that you Touch,\nAnd all that you See,\nAll that you Taste,\nAll you Feel,\nAnd all that you Love,\nAnd all that you Hate,\nAll you Distrust,\nAll you Save,\nAnd all that you Give,\nAnd all that you Deal,\nAnd all that you Buy, Beg, Borrow, or Steal\nAnd all you Create,\nAnd all you Destroy,\nAnd all that you Do,\nAnd all that you Say,\nAnd all that you Eat,\nAnd everyone you Meet,\nAnd all that you Slight,\nAnd everyone you Fight,\nAnd all that is Now,\nAnd all that is Gone,\nAnd all that\'s to Come,\nAnd everything under the Sun is in Tune, but the Sun is Eclipsed,\nBy The Moon.................\n\nBegins and Ends, with a faint heartbeat.']",5.00 stars
Ashit_T,"['My second Pink Floyd album I heard after ""Division Bell"". The only word that can describe this album is Masterpiece. It is nice to see that all band members contributed to the creativity of the album. Waters is a genius when it comes to lyrics and this album is far superior lyrically when compared to the so called ""post-Waters era"" albums - Momentary Lapse and Division Bell.\nThe songs that stand out are ""Time"", ""Breathe"" and ""Brain Damage/ Eclipse"". The only song I find slightly disappointing is ""Money"" which somehow never appealed to my tastes.\nAll in all a superb album, a must buy for fans of any music genre.']",5.00 stars

chamberk,"['It\'s one of the best-selling albums of all time, and you can hardly walk through a high school without seeing a shirt with that famous prism emblazoned on the chest. The biggest song, ""Money,"" is played on classic rock stations approximately once every 2 minutes across the country. It is inextricably linked to both pot and the Wizard of Oz in everyone\'s minds. Needless to say, this album\'s reputation precedes it.\n\nDespite all that hype, it\'s still pretty sWell. It\'s highly theatrical, playing out almost like a classical piece, flowing from one movement to the next. The sound is varied, with awesomely overblown solos from guitar and saxophone (!!!) and, most memorably, a wild and yowling vocal performance on ""Great Gig in the Sky."" (Not a favorite of some people.) The lyrics are fairly broad when they tackle themes like life, death, money, madness, and time, but it\'s filled with memorable lines. And as dramatic and far-reaching as it could be, for me, it keeps from being overindulgent like most prog rock (and some of Floyd\'s other albums). It clocks in at under 45 minutes and doesn\'t overstay its welcome. A classic record that showcased everything great about the band.']",4.50 stars

It\'s a wonder to behold. It\'s filled with strange voices. These are recording studio staff and Pink Floyd roadies. Wings were also in the studio at the time, so Paul and Linda McCartney and Denny Lane, did voices for it too, but Paul and Linda\'s were dropped at the last moment, but Denny Lane\'s voice can still be heard at the end of Money, saying: ""I Dunno, I Was Really Drunk At The Time..."" It\'s also in the Guiness book of records for the longest amount of time spent in the top 200 album charts. 11.4 years! 26 years in another Billboard chart.

schicken46,"[""This is the point when everything the Floyd had been doing for the last 5 years finally came together: Waters' wannabe singer-songwriter ambitions (which never fit in with the Floyd's sound before), Gilmour's and wright's melodies, the band's jamming, and the musique concrete; it's all here but for the first time it's actually all together at the same time, instead of in different racks. Previous Floyd albums would have a Waters song and then a musique concrete or other experimental track, and some spacey jams. Here it's all of a piece.\nThis is not my favourite Floyd album, in part because I think Waters has written way better lyrics but also because I just prefer the jammier version of the Floyd to this more restrained version. But it's hard to deny how effective this record is - there's a reason it was a massive hit - as well as how unbelievably well-produced it is. This stuff was really hard to do in 1972 and the fact that it still sounds good 45 years later is some kind of miracle.\nIt's not my favourite album, it might not be their best album, but it's far and away their most iconic album and one of the landmark records of the 1970s, with how it managed to integrate the avant garde into such a commercial package.""]",5.00 stars

1SKEETER,"[""When this album first came out, nothing came close to it. Radio Shack used it for their demo record to show what their stereo systems were capable of. I liked it then, and I like it now. It was an engineering marvel at the time of it's release, and it is still amazing to listen to. This is by leaps and bounds a far better album than anything else Pink Floyd has ever done. It is still amazing that they were able to get the sounds on DSOTM before synths and other technology took the place of ingenuity.\n\nSomething that HAS to be considered with this album is that audiophile technology was new when it came out. NOTHING out at the time DSOTM was released came even remotely sonically close to this. The clarity of the production, each instrument was crisp and bright in the mix. The depth of the bass, the bright but not harsh highs.\nIt is my understanding that DSOTM won classical music awards. This was UNHEARD of, when DSOTM was released classical music fans were snobs that viewed rock music with disdain and contempt. This album made stereo systems sound ENORMOUS. Of course, now that there have been 30 years of sound engineers whose textbooks all leave a paper trail back to DSOTM, this is probably hard to comprehend.\nAnd, the songs. One of the things that makes this album so good is that it is a complete cohesive work . Everything about it fits together like a chinese puzzle. The songs flow together and fit together. The artwork matches the overall sound. The dynamic range flows with the lyrics. The music paints the same picture as the lyrics that accompany it.\nIt is a MASTERPIECE.

thenadz,"['_Dark Side of the Moon_ is the greatest album of all time. But reading this, you either already know that, or think everyone who says it is full of themselves.\n\nIn any argument against _Dark Side_ as the greatest, people inevitably say 1)it\'s boring and there is a lot of dull time or 2)concept aside, the songs alone simply aren\'t that great.\n\nIf the argument is that it\'s boring, then you should just get back to looking at your Backstreet Boys posters and stop looking at a site for people serious about music. Just because an album takes its time in developing its musical feel and flow, doesn\'t mean its boring. _Dark Side of the Moon_ is perfect in maintaining its overall flow and tempo, giving the album its cohesive nature and the feeling that you are listening to the movements of a single work rather than a collection of singles.\n\nAs for the songs themselves, songs like ""Time"", ""Money"", ""Speak to Me/Breathe"", and ""Brain Damage"" are classics. While some of the tracks might not be as good (""On the Run"" comes to mind), even the weaker tracks can be enjoyed when listened to in the context of the album. That is what puts _Dark Side of the Moon_ at the head of the class.\n\nAs an added bonus, for people who like to consider historical context in weighing albums, _Dark Side..._ was a landmark in production quality and studio experimentation. Especially when you consider that _Dark Side of the Moon_ was recorded before the invention of digital recording techniques, the album becomes even more of a studio marvel, with all of the sound effects (clocks, cash registers, etc..) spliced into the the tracks manually.\n\nJust to complete the package, _Dark Side of the Moon_ has awesome cover art, perhaps the best of all time. And anyone who doubts the importance of cover art to an album\'s overall perception should talk to someone who was around when _Sgt. Peppers_ was first released and see how the cover art alone captured the essence of the 60\'s.']",5.00 stars

stanger,"[""Dark side of the moon (Dsotm) has sold millions, upon millions of albums I’m sure we all know. Despite this though I thought that I would not like the album. A strange thought to have before even listening but too many 'Masterpieces' have failed to impress me before.\n\nMy first listen to the album seemed to agree with this but the last two songs gave me hope, so I listened again and the albums vault of music goodness opened itself up to me.\n\nI saw the dark atmosphere of the album that all to many times puts you in a front row seat and runs you through madness, the use of peoples voices and the way they echo really does convey a feeling of insanity.\n\nThe concept of the album and the way the album operates as one whole really is another aspect that needs to be appreciated, especially in this age of disposable downloads that are often used in today’s hectic lifestyles. This keeps an atmospheric feeling within and so does the seamless nature of the songs that meld into each other, the end of one song is just the start of another.\n\nDsotm has a real epic feel to it and no one can deny that those guitar solos and drum beats aren't amazing. The album sometimes runs like a film in your mind, just one example of the great imagery it can create, it really is a playground for metaphors and hidden meaning: From the front cover to the lyrics within.\n\nThe only negative points for me is that it requires patience and the split second gaps between each songs interfere with the transaction of the seamless nature of the songs. Ultimately though it is great and while browsing Rateyourmusic it sank in that this was one of the best albums I had ever heard.\n\nJust one tip, listen to the album with headphones.

Grampus,"['The Dark Side Of The Moon is one of those albums that, given the amount of albums I own, you would bet your life on being included. Even if you\'re not a big Pink Floyd fan - and I can\'t claim to be one of those - you will more than likely have heard of this. It was around two years after its release that I bought the album and it was still in the higher reaches of the charts and would be for years to come. It was this sustained demand which piqued my interest. My hesitancy was due to having no notion of what to expect and no friends who were into the band. Of course, ""Money"" was the mandatory rock song played at school discos but had never been tempting enough. Now, I simply had to know what all the fuss was about.\n\nIf you\'d been with the Floyd since their early days this album must have come as something of a shock. No more lack of definition and psychedelic meanderings, rather a resonant, vibrant set which is segued like a concept album but isn\'t. The band hardly put a foot wrong - although some of Water\'s lyrics are flimsy. Of course, the well known tracks remain essential but it\'s the instrumentals ""On The Run"" and ""Any Colour You Like"" which hold the thing together. In fact, the music in general is what makes the album work; after the alarm clocks the introduction to ""Time"" remains wonderfully evocative, whilst the saxophone in ""Us And Them"" is sublime.\n\nFor once, an album deserving of its status.']",5.00 stars

ILY,"['Obviously, a well-written and meticulously arranged and produced album. BUT.. These songs are easy-listening, and have hardly anything to do with the band that once wrote ""Interstellar Overdrive"" and ""A Saucerful Of Secrets"". They are only vaguely related to the mellower moments of ""Atom Heart Mother"" and ""Echoes"".\n\nBasically, up until that point with each successive album Pink Floyd were diluting their sound, but retained artistic credibility by using the complex structure (i.e. the suite) and elaborate production values. Here, the complex structure is dispensed with (replaced by the ""concept""), and the production is merely a technocratic pursuit of fidelity.\n\n""Breathe"", ""The Great Gig In The Sky"" and ""Us And Them"" are lounge; music to be played in cocktail bars for the bourgeoisie, or for the proletariat consumer after a hard day\'s work, made worse by layers upon layers of syrupy backing female-vocals and suave saxophone. ""Time"" (whose intro is more intriguing than the actual song), the funk/ blues-rock ""Money"" and ""Brain Damage"" are pretty pop-rock tracks, but nothing substantial. In 3 minutes, the angst-ridden synthesizer experiment ""On The Run"" is the most meaningful moment here, while the art-rock jam ""Any Colour You Like"" is in fact a snippet from ""Atom Heart Mother"".\n\nGrossly overrated.']",2.50 stars

greenback,"['This record contains more or less mellow spacy/experimental progressive rock tracks. Many people from any social class like or love this record. Actually, maybe it is the most popular progressive album. With the help of Alan Parsons, Pink Floyd was able to produce one of the most state-of-the-art recording in the progressive music history. The tracks are not fast nor complex; the catchy airs are addictive enough to please many people. The record contains MANY delightful sounds, like old man voices in the background, existential laughs, mechanical clocks, ringing clocks, heartbeats, cash machine operations... There are some excellent catchy female backing vocals, like on ""Time"". David Gilmour plays some excellent guitar solos like the sluggish one on ""Time"" and the VERY heroic & flashy one on ""Money"", even sounding better than the best Jimi Hendrix\'s solo! David Gilmour\'s lead vocals are, as always, EXCELLENT. Dick Parry plays a moaning sax solo on ""Money"".\n\nThe album starts with a desperate human cry, followed by the smooth and relaxing ""Breathe"", having some Hawaiian guitar soundscapes. ""On the run"" is the weakest track of this record: there are very repetitive and experimental keyboards, sounding a bit like the Vangelis\' Spiral track: it ends with crazy laughs before a plane crash! ""The great gig in the sky"" has an OUTSTANDING hysterical female vocals performance, well supported by a visceral floating organ, followed by a tender combination of rhythmic piano and the same but less intense orgasmic female vocals, performed by the enigmatic Clare Torry. ""Us and them"" is the relaxing one, which should relieve your bad emotions: Gilmour\'s soothing voice and delicate guitar notes, Parry\'s tender/brutal sax parts, Wright\'s uninterrupted background organ, everything form an unforgettable song, universally accepted as a classic one, even among non prog communities. ""Any color you like"" has Wright\'s psychedelic moogs and Gilmour\'s guitar sounding like a dirty organ. ""Brain damage"" and ""Eclipse"" have excellent female backing vocals, visceral & dirty organ textures and clean guitar notes.

That said, the 30th anniversary stereo vinyl record is the best recording of this masterpiece I've ever heard. Granted it doesn't bounce around behind your head like the SA-CD, but it is the most musical version in existence and it has the blackest background of any record ever made. The SA-CD is probably a close second (although the MOFI vinyl was really good). If you are a music-lover but not a vinyl record collector, then you owe it to yourself to buy as good an SA-CD player as you can afford (or better) and buy this SA-CD, because the regular CD version is pretty crappy.

allen086,"[""Pink Floyd have added another dimension to my life. This band gave us the most creative and imaginative music I have ever heard. The first time I heard Floyd, I was about 10 years old. My father played Dark Side of the Moon on LP but, being so young I couldn't really connect with it. However, at 15 years of age I discovered Floyd properly and their music and artwork blew my mind. It's the depth and the passion that accompanies the music that captures your imagination, as if it's an extra you get when you buy the LP or CD. The lyrical talent of Roger Waters, the delicate yet powerful guitar playing from Dave Gilmour, the often overlooked drumming of Nick Mason together with the skillful Richard Wright, provide the basis for the ultimate super group.\n\nPower is something you discover goes hand in hand with Pink Floyd, the delivery of each and every word and the effect of a screaming, harmonious guitar solo give the listener something to gasp at with every play. But with Dark Side, it's all of this magnified a million times. Following the process of life, from birth to death, Floyd take you on a journey. This album is their masterpiece, THE concept album. I like to think of the album as one long 43-minute track, and that's how I listen to it. Skipping tracks is not what Floydians do. You should listen to Floyd in albums, not tracks to gain the maximum from their work.\n\nSo from the outset with 'Speak to me' and 'Breathe' you are bombarded with tape-looped sound effects from every angle. The transition into ‘Breathe’ is more amazing every time – they project the feeling of being born, entering the world. Then with 'On the run' and 'Time' you begin to discover the themes of the album, the sense of loss, of social alienation and detachment. Floyd tackle this head on and they are not afraid to challenge these concepts. 'Time' for me is the stand out track, perfectly balanced and easy to relate to, it also contains a very powerful and extremely emotional guitar solo from Gilmour.\n\n'Great Gig in the Sky' is another fantastic piece, glorious and enchanting with Claire Tori giving us something truly special with her vocals. Turn this up loud and it reveals another level of integrity, it’s delicate and beautiful, making it intensely satisfying to listen to.\n\nIn 'Money' you'll find one of Floyd's most famous songs. Along with 'Another Brick in the wall' (from 'The Wall') it is a track that suffers from being overplayed, although once understood as a melodic masterstroke it is plain to see the reason for its popularity. This song is obviously about materialism, which ironically would greet the members of Pink Floyd as a direct result of this albums success.\n\nContinuing on, 'Us and Them' is a beautiful song with real wisdom in the words spoken. Having vivid lyrics and profound imagery, it provides an excellent listening experience. 'Any colour you like' is a magnificent little instrumental and it's another of my favourite phases of the album. Its beauty, as always, is in the detail and the way 'Us and them' leads into 'Any colour you like' is pure brilliance, seamlessly blended together, it's one song.\n\nFurthermore, 'Brain Damage' and 'Eclipse' are also partnered, and in my opinion, provide something absolutely extraordinary in the way of an ending. These two songs are the final chapter and they close the album with such style. Sitting in a dark room, headphones on or stereo turned up to the maximum possible volume, the sounds, the feelings and the emotions they convey are astonishing. For those moments, when the music culminates, you connect, you feel like you're part of it.\n\nThe combination of all this; the band members and their instruments and their love for what they do has given us music that breathes. The music you find on Dark Side of the Moon, is the kind that will never date or will never lose its original value or message. Furthermore, people, no matter which generation they belong to, will never forget what it stands for. Pink Floyd is Art but in ways it’s so much more, it's a place we go to – it’s escapism. I give 'Dark Side of the Moon' the full five stars because I love it so, it's the soundtrack to my life and it will follow me wherever I choose to go.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it's part of me.""]",5.00 stars

YotRoaxer,"['This was one of the most revolutionary albums of the 70\'s. Its rich sound was new, exciting, and brilliantly showcased. The ultimate album. It made Pink Floyd the band it is today. Perfect for long drives on a dark road. Great album, possibly the best\n\nIt opens with a slight and silent drum beat. Slowly and gradually it arises to thumping of a heart beat. Soon random mechanical sounds of machinery and everyday play flicker in and out. The madness grows and grows. Then with a scream of horror and unimaginable terror the first note of ""Breathe"" slaps you in the face. It moves in and out with tingling lyrics that makes it one of the band\'s best song. It segues right into the paranoid chaos of ""On The Run."" You are running trying desperately to reach your airplane. You come closer and closer but the plane takes off. In a subtle shock you watch the plane take- but wait. Something happens and the plane comes spiralling down. That is what ""On The Run"" is with blistering synthesizers shooting out. An a final explosion closes the moment. As the wind howls up theres a faint sound in the distance. A clock. Then hundreds of clocks begin to tick and shake before leaving a fitting duet between Nick Mason on the drums and Roger Waters on Bass. They play a heart beat like sound that rises and rises; building new layers each time. It rises to a certain peak then it all catches up and fires. In rip-roars David Gilmour\'s massive guitar and vocals. ""Time"" continunally shoots all around in this fashion. It takes leave only after ingenious lyrics, a neck stiffening solo and the ""Breathe Reprise."" The final song on side one, ""Great Gig In The Sky"" begins. It starts with slow piano piece. Background bits of dialogue is added, then boom! Clara Torry\'s vocals hit full power in coordination with the whole band. With the the first side brilliantly ends, with a doubt one of the best sides of an album, ever.\n\nThe second side begins with the commercialized yet fun ""Money."" After blowing the standard riff it segues right into the melodic saxophone of ""Us An Them"" which is followed by short and great instrumental jam called ""Any Colour You Like."" ""Brain Damage"" then kicks off with its slow, melodic beginning of chronicling the whereabouts of a lunatic. It builds and builds until the final culmination: ""Eclipse"" the two minute closing piece that gives the album a damn fine close.\n\nRevolutionary and original, there is nothing like this. Roger Waters wrote some wonderful lyrics and the whole album, production and all, has been pushed to the farthest bounds of perfection.']",5.00 stars

But my prescription of controlled narcotics was simultaneously expanding (i doubt i'm unique). Eventually however the drugs were left alone, which resulted in a downward spiral of regard for _dark side of the moon_. I didn't listen to it for years. Then in a friends house i was once again introduced to the experience of _dark side of the moon_.

I figured hey its highly rated I _have_ liked what I\'ve heard just buy it. So I did. It was pretty much what I expected some classic tunes sandwiched between a lot of irritating psychedelic noise and sound affects. _Speak To Me_ can be skipped all together but by the time you get to _Breathe in the Air_ you hit on why this album is easily one of the greatest of the past 50 years. This song is the main reason I purchased this little beauty and it was well worth it. You will not find more beautiful sounds anywhere.\n_On the Run_ is another waste of your time and you\'ll find yourself reaching for the skip button.\n_The Great Gig in the Sky_ is not bad, some nice soft slide guitar which really is one of highlights if this album. Unfortunately Clare Torrey stars screaming for the next two minutes.. is it only two minutes? Jesus it feels like an hour! It fits the tune but can get on your nerves. This is a ""sometimes skip"".\nThings pick up again with _Money_, easily one of the most recognizable intro\'s ever. Some great guitar work and tongue in cheek lyrics. Hell come to think of it they could be the words to a 50 cent tune. Too bad for him these beat him to it by 30 years. A classic that you must have. Duck 50!\n_Us and Them_ is my second favorite tune on here with a very chill melody and concept. I could listen to this all day, sweet.\n_Any Colour You Like_ is yet another instrumental but definitely the best one on here. Its funny but with a good instrumental tune you don\'t even notice there is no singing. Quite good.\nThe psychedelia continues with _Brain Damage_. Not a bad tune, a little pretentious for my liking but listenable... barely.\nHey lets finish this off with one more pretentious pile of over produced crap. Yeah _Eclipse_.\nOverall this album is definitely essential, it must be in your collection. The good spots are as good as anything ever recorded by a group of humans. All I can say is have the remote handy, that is unless of course you\'re tripping on some California Sunshine, and then you won\'t even notice the annoying ambient interludes.

Overall, I felt the mixing of this was quite lifeless, and came to a rather misguided idea that the studio album simply hadn't been all that good and the live one was much better. Because of this, _Dark Side_ became _PULSE_ as far as I was concerned, and this one just collected dust for the most part.\n\nIt turned out later, when I heard the new 30th Anniversary version, that I was quite wrong. The problem hadn't been at all with the studio version as a whole; it had been with the mixing on the 20th Anniversary edition! That is why I'm awarding only 3.5 stars to the 20th anniversary release; this lower quality mix caused a great album to go very near the bottom of my listening pile for years. It hurts--but people need to know there are much better versions of it available that really show _Dark Side_ for what it is...in a way this version doesn't.""]",4.00 stars

FloydWright,"['There is a good reason that _Dark Side of the Moon_ is considered one of the best rock albums of all time. At the same time, the band gives us both excellent music with input from all members, and also provides an accessible, _universal_ concept. That is what sets _Dark Side_ apart from all of the concept albums that would follow this one in the Pink Floyd catalogue--while the others grew more and more specific to one man, Roger Waters, the themes of _Dark Side_ are something that everyone can identify with easily: time, death, money, war--all of these are a part of the total human experience that all of us are living. And, while the lyrics here are related to each other, there is enough room for the listener to interpret, imagine, and take from this album what he or she wishes. That, more than anything, is what sets _Dark Side_ above all of Pink Floyd\'s other concepts.\n\nThe music of _Dark Side_ is nothing short of superb, and incredibly innovative for its time. The warped synth piece ""On the Run"", in fact, was the song that first signaled to me that something about this band was different, and drew me into the work of Pink Floyd. There is input from all four members, including the marvelous roto-tom solo from drummer Nick Mason at the beginning of ""Time"". Guitarist David Gilmour has wonderful vocals and guitar playing to contribute--for the former I suggest ""Money"", and for the latter, ""Breathe"". Lyric writer Roger Waters has a part in the music, too, including vocals on ""Brain Damage"" that suit the song very nicely. But the album\'s most stunning songs, from a musical perspective, were either authored by or influenced by Richard Wright, who in many ways is probably Pink Floyd\'s greatest ""composer"".\n\n""The Great Gig in the Sky"", also featuring superb vocals from Clare Torry, has a strange, mesmerising, but still very listenable chord progression, and is probably among Mr. Wright\'s greatest accomplishments as a music-writer. ""Breathe"" is another song where he had input, as proven by his comments on the recent DVD where the band is interviewed about this album, contributing some of its most distinctive chord changes. ""Time"" and ""Us and Them"" both feature Mr. Wright\'s fascinating vocals--the last that Pink Floyd fans would hear until ""Wearing the Inside Out"" on _The Division Bell_. But it is ""Us and Them"" that is perhaps one of the greatest masterpieces in the Pink Floyd catalogue. This is the only other appearance of the powerful Wright/Waters songwriting team heard on _Obscured by Clouds_, _Dark Side_\'s painfully underrated predecessor. Some of the most majestic music Richard Wright has ever created, coupled with the lyrics of Roger Waters, make this song completely unforgettable. There is simply nothing like it.\n\nIn modern times one can no longer rely on popularity as a measure of quality...except perhaps in the inverse: ""The more popular it is, the lower the quality is."" Back when _Dark Side_ was released, though, it was the other way around. Believe me when I say this--this album stayed on the Billboard charts for as long as it did for _very_ good reason. If your record collection is missing this masterpiece, you need to put that right _immediately_.']",5.00 stars

FloydWright,"['Preface: I am writing as one who has owned multiple masters of DSotM, and write for a similar audience. Therefore if you are just beginning with Pink Floyd, you may want to skim this review.\n\n----\n\nEven if you don\'t own an SACD player (I don\'t), you should definitely enjoy the benefits of this remaster. I was quite surprised, frankly; I bought the remaster almost wholly for the artwork (which I find beautiful), not expecting much audio improvement, and I got quite a pleasant shock.\n\nThe improvement in clarity is extremely noticeable right from the first few seconds of the album: the effects of ""Speak To Me"" come in sooner and with greater clarity. All of the other songs are greatly improved, especially the drums on ""Time"" (it almost starts to measure up to the majesty of the _PULSE_ drums), and the entire song ""Money"" has had a HUGE increase in audio quality (this last I usually only listened to on _PULSE_ because I did not care so much for the studio version). So have the other tracks, but these are some of the ones that got my attention immediately.\n\nThe greatest addition is this one on ""Eclipse"", previously only noticed by audiophiles: if you turn this album WAY up, after the words ""There is no dark side in the moon, really; as a matter of fact, it\'s all dark"", you will hear music in the right channel, and extremely faint whispering in the left channel. I was able to hear this on a cheaper portable CD player, with simple earphones, where I could NEVER hear it before, even on nice headphones.\n\nAll in all, even if you have not got an SACD player, this is well worth your money...the cover is not the only thing that has changed!']",5.00 stars

garydavis,"['Yeah, it\'s overplayed but my solution to that is to listen to it sparingly. On the radio, only one song is heard at a time. This being a concept album, both musically and in lyrical content, it is necessary to listen to it all at once to fully enjoy it. Its hypnotic, ""druggy"" sound is certainly a big part of its appeal but the lyrics are the best part of the album. The descent into madness of founding Pink Floyd leader Syd Barrett was the one of the inspirations for the lyrical content.

Proghead72,"['I am not exactly sure how I should go about rating this. This is one of those albums that I\'ve been exposed to as a kid thanks to my parents owning a copy. At the time, I thought parts of the album frightened me. Of course, no longer being a kid, the album doesn\'t frighten me anymore. My difficulty rating this album goes for the fact so much of this album has been played to death on FM radio, making it difficult for me to review it objectively. As everyone points out, the production is incredible, no doubt helped by Alan Parsons. For decades this album was no doubt well-loved by audiophiles, and been used to test stereos ever since. And especially with a song like ""Time"" with the loud alarm clocks, you can see why. Then there\'s the synth experiment with ""On the Run"" which really creeped me out as a kid, especially with the explosion at the end made me think of a nuclear bomb going off and how Hiroshima and Nagasaki looked during the aftermath. I have to admit I still like the ballad ""Breathe"". This particular style of song seemed to have a big impact on many prog rock bands in its wake, and it was still felt with Porcupine Tree (check out ""I Find That I\'m Not There"" off _The Sky Moves Sideways_). Frankly I really got sick of ""Money"" big time, but I had little problem with when I was younger (but then it\'s that ""overplayed on the radio"" syndrome that made me sick of the song). ""Us and Them"" is another ballad, but again, the ""overplayed on the radio"" syndrome makes it difficult for me to appreciate it. One song worth mentioning is the instrumental ""Any Colour You Like"". Thanks to the radio stations not playing this one, it\'s a pretty nice piece, dominated by synthesizers. Being familiar with this album from start to finish, it would have been a lot easier for me to appreciate this album if it wasn\'t for tons of radio stations playing this to death. The album stayed on the chart well in to the 1980s, which meant it seemed the only people not owning a copy, or ever hearing it, are the N\'Sync, Backstreet Boys, Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears crowd. Of course the album isn\'t bad. I can see the kind of impact this album had on many when it first came out in 1973. Even when I was a kid (although this was 1979 or 1980 when my dad bought his copy) I could see the kind of impact this album had (although at that time, I was not one bit aware of the hype this album generated, but I did hear many of the songs on the local FM dial). To me, I think this album would be a must to own if you never listened to the FM dial, where you can listen to it with a fresh mind. For me, I more preferred many of their other albums (especially the ones that predate _Dark Side_) because the songs hadn\'t been played to death.']",3.50 stars

I was there when it first came out and I got so used to hearing it everywhere all the time that I almost grew deaf to it. It simply became part of the fabric of life.\n\nHow to rate it? How do you rate the closest member of the family?\n\nMusically it is very carefully crafted, with every note and every effect exactly in the right place. The music flows smoother than before, the sound effects are closer integrated and less distracting, the lyrics are somewhat more direct. With no breaks, very similar tempi in all the songs and that heartbeat at the beginning and end the album is truly a seamless entity. Still, each track has its own character, creates its own soundscape, but nevertheless fits in with its neighbours like chapters in a book. I can\'t think of a single one that is markedly weaker than the rest.\n\nIn their middle period, from _Meddle_ until _The Final Cut_ , Pink Floyd were the reliable, trustworthy master craftsmen of rock. None of the quartet are really technically exceptional. Dave Gilmour is probably the best musician in the band, he is certainly capable but by no means as virtuoso as Steve Howe or as atmospherical as Steve Hackett. The vocals are in fact rather bland (not counting Claire Torry\'s rather stellar performance in ""The Great Gig in the Sky""!) and nowhere near what could be heard from contemporaries such as Peter Gabriel, Brian Ferry or Jon Anderson. Bass and drums form a solid foundation but never really sparkle, and Rick Wrights keyboards are almost non-descript. Still when all is said and done, the whole thing comes together in a rather miraculous way and goes to show that the total can be so much more than the sum of its parts. Perhaps the lack of a single overbearing musician is the reason why the album is so well balanced and rounded?\n\nMy rating? It is not \'the best\' album, such a thing does not exist. But, I love it.

Obviously, to get the full effect of this album, the listener is meant to be stoned and sitting in a black lit room. Considering that _Dark Side of the Moon_ hung around in the top 200 for a record breaking umpteen years, a lot of people kept their black lights plugged in and spent a lot of money on dope for a long time, with enough money left over to buy a new copy of _Dark Side_ once the vinyl wore thin. Now that black lights are not available, new listeners are obviously paying for the more expensive cd and the rest for more dope. For a lot of people, this may be a perfectly enjoyable form of entertainment. For me, getting high was just as much a waste of my time as listening to _Dark Side of the Moon_.

However, I\'ll admit, I can certainly see some small tinges of genius that pop up here and there, genius that didn\'t really fully develop, I don\'t think, until _Animals_ was made. But when these small sparkles of aptitude emerge, they really do hit hard. The screaming lady at the start of the album who signals the whole band to come in with beautiful arpeggios and steel guitar. The genius lyrics and structural power of ""Time."" The powerful cries of ""The Great Gig in the Sky."" That catchy bass riff to ""Money."" The epic and glorious outro of ""Eclipse."" Yes, there are certainly some brilliant moments on this album, but ultimately I do feel it has some big flaws. Firstly, while I\'m probably not being open-minded enough, I have to say, ""On the Run"" is a very poor track to be heard on this supposed \'masterpiece.\' Secondly, \'Us and them,\' while a reasonably nice song, goes on way too long. I can\'t even count the amount of times I thought it was finally going to stop and then was suddenly aggravated again by the start of another verse. And ""Brain Damage,"" while a reasonably decent song that musically portrays its theme of madness well, doesn\'t really seem to go anywhere either. I won\'t nag too much though.

Pressed_Rat,"[""Pink Floyd's _Dark Side of the Moon_ is often heralded as being one of the greatest rock albums of all-time. However, such words are often heard coming from the mainstream, FM radio-listening audiences and the magazines and radio stations which cater to these people's tastes. Unfortunately, many of the people who consider DSotM as being Pink Floyd's best album have heard very little of the band's output, other than for this album, _Wish You Were Here_, and, of course, _The Wall_.\n\nI am not saying this is the case with everyone, but this is what I often gather, personally.\n\nI think Brian Eno summed it up best in a 1974 interview, saying that what Pink Floyd was doing in '73/74 was the same as their previous work, only with the crude edges taken off in order to appeal to a larger audience. Now I don't know if this was Floyd's intention at the time, but it seems like it might have been.\n\nAs enjoyable as this album may be to many people, it is not half as interesting as what Floyd was doing up until this point. Their pre-DSotM era was daring, experimental, and had the unpretentious crudeness in sound that DSotM just doesn't have. DSotM is much more refined, accessible, and less challenging.\n\nAlso, I feel that this album has suffered a great deal as the result of most of its tracks being continuously aired on FM radio. Say what you will, but I definitely think this has a negative impact on the music. It's not necessarily the band's fault - or is it? The album seems pretty much geared for the radio, despite what the members of the band may say.\n\n_Dark Side of the Moon_ is a great album in terms of its production. But its content is lacking. Again, it could be because I've heard all the songs on this album too many times and it has became all too familiar for my liking.\n\nI loved this album when I was younger. But after years of hearing its songs continuously played on the airwaves, as well as my discovery of other music - it just doesn't hold up like it used to - nor does it interest me like it once did. I consider it to be music for the masses.\n\nIt would be difficult for me to give a track by track rating of this album, being as biased as I am. If this was 1973 and I was hearing this album for the first time, then it might be a different story.\n\nI give this album an obligatory 3/5 stars.""]",3.00 stars

It is appaling to see EMI reissue this album for what I think may be the fifth time on compact disc. This is not really better that most of Floyd's post Syd output, just more accessable and, well, average. _Dark Side Of The Moon_ is merely a classic because of it's staying power on the charts or the fact that it was hard to escape it on FM radio up to the mid-90's. Do these things make it an innovative album? No. Listen to King Crimson's _Lark's Tounge's In Aspic_, Eno's _Here Come The Warm Jets_ or Can's _Future Days_ from the same year and see if _Dark Side_ is all people make of it. Possibly if it was released in 1969 or 1970 it would have been innovative, but 1973? No way.""]",3.50 stars

""time"", ""money"", ""us and them"", even ""speak to me"" and ""great gig in the sky"" will never grow old, but the album as a concept loses luster when you hear it often. however, it is essential for any music collection and must be heard to understand pink floyd and 70s rock.']",4.50 stars

It\'s a shame, \'cos I really was looking forward listening to this so called \'masterpiece\', but now after listening to it I must say I feel heavily disappointed. It wasn\'t exactly what I was hoping to hear. _Dark Side Of The Moon_ revealed to be a huge, gigantic and dull stadionrock album with meaningless and too long songs and not to mention all the playing with the voices (clocks, insane laughs etc.) that seemed quite a strange. Of course it sounded very well and maybe was ahead of its time when released, but you can\'t argue the fact that Floyd\'s were much more better on their next _Wish You Were Here_ album where all the ideas that they were trying to do on this record got its peak. ""Time"" and ""Money"" lasts about six minutes, but still I managed to get bored while listening to them and it never happens when I listen to ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-5) that lasts almost 14 minutes or ""Wish You Were Here"" (5½ minutes), so you have to say that something is wrong. Pink Floyd maybe wasn\'t ready to make this kind of music then and this would probably be \'the seed\' that flourished on _Wish You Were Here_.\nI\'m so tired to hear praising that this album has got, it\'s not so special at all! Sometimes I feel that the ones who acclaim this most haven\'t even bothered to listen the record not even once or maybe just once and think it is cool just because everybody is saying so. Well, this could have been a revolutionary album if the stuff would have been much stronger and innovative. ""Speak To Me/Breathe"", ""Us And Them"" and ""Brain Damage"" represent the best and gives some taste what was to come, but they can\'t beat any of _Wish You Were Here_ material.

CardinalMark,"['I first listened to this album last year after being aware of its massive reputation for so long, and having heard little excerpts. After listening to the first few tracks I was aware I was hearing something brilliant. Having been originally released in 1973, it was clearly an album ahead of its time. The technological experimentation and changes of tempo and mood make it a thrilling and compelling listening experience.Its conception sounds deceptively complex, yet the music is in fact quite simple and serves to create its genius. My only criticisms are of the piece ""Any Colour You Like"" which I don\'t think stands up to the rest of the album. I love the earlier two instrumental pieces,""On the Run"" and ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" which contrast rather brilliantly with each other. One other point is a criticism of Pink Floyd themselves-neither Gilmour or Waters has an outstanding singing voice, which means that occasionally Floyd can sound dreary. But often that fits in with the mood on this album. I think Pink Floyd recorded more outstanding songs on other albums(_Wish You Were Here_, _Animals_ and _The Wall_ notably) but this is their best album because I think the conception, structure and the balance were right-something Roger Waters\' ego doesn\'t allow for on later Floyd albums.']",4.50 stars

If you listen to it enough (and you appreciate this sort of music), everything falls into place and the entire album develops a harmony.\n\nI suppose it is harmony in many senses; the songs flow incredibly smoothly throughout the entire album - I have never been able to remember where ""Brain Damage"" (8) ends and ""Eclipse"" (9) begins. Also, the actual elements of the music seem to fit together impossibly and still somehow establish ""musical rapport"" with the listener. Those who have heard these songs many times will feel something in respose to the lyrics ""And in the end it\'s only round and round / And round / Haven\'t you heard it\'s a battle of words.""\n\nThere is serious soul in Pink Floyd\'s music; while Beatles music may sound great, Pink Floyd is spiritual. I mean, they say Jazz is all about soul. What the heck are they thinking? And what other band could give a song involving cash registers and clinking money such virve and soul? Almost any other band would\'ve botched it; Pink Floyd is more amazing than almost any other band, even 30 years later. They are the new sound for today.

Cheeseman,"['This is a really dissapointing album. The lyrics are mediocre, the\nmusic is third-rate, and the singing is just 3 of them in harmony most\nof the time. Luckily, ""Time"" and ""Money"" are ok songs. Otherwise I\nwould have sold this a while ago.']",2.50 stars
grant,"['A masterpiece. Outstanding tracks include \'Money\', \'Brain Damage\' and my personal favourite \'Time\' (""And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but its sinking..."" simply wonderful). However its hard to pick individual tracks as the whole album flows so beautifully well. An essential purchase.']",4.50 stars

Jivaro,"['Ok - let me say something different than anyone else. This is the longest-running album of ALL TIME on the Billboard 200 chart: a reign lasting around 14 years! I\'d say that\'s quite impressive. There was a time when you had to own this record because it was the only way to see how well your system performed.\n\nNo matter what others say, this is a historical piece of music. You can say yea or nay to the Mona Lisa, but it is recognized as a masterpiece worldwide. And that has to account for something. :P\n\nI own a first release on vinyl, and I have the 20th anniversary release on CD. It performs just as well as if it was a ""gold"" or ""original master"" version.\n\nAs far as testing my system\'s worth, I have never used _Dark Side of the Moon_. Instead, I used the self-titled _Metallica_.']",5.00 stars
Radiance,"['""No-one told you when to run,\nyou missed the starting gun...""\n\n_Dark Side of the Moon_ was the start of a whole new era for Pink Floyd. Released in the early 70\'s, this was the first album where all lyrics were written by Roger Waters, with the rest of the band contributing musical ideas. Featuring lots of interesting snippets of background dialogue and sound effects, this album is a truly remarkable concept album and my personal favorite Floyd record. It\'s difficult to consider the songs individually, since they all flow together and it\'s really the most rewarding to listen to the whole album in one sitting, but the best tracks in my opinion are ""Time"" - with its opening cacophony of about a 1000 clocks, ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" - featuring almost orgasmic vocals by Claire Torry, ""Money"" and ""Us and Them"".\n\nIf you are new to Pink Floyd, I personally regard _Dark Side_ as their best album and would advise you to listen to this before buying anything else. If you\'re not a fan, it\'s still difficult not to recognize the influence of this album on the evolution of rock music.\n\nIt\'s a musical masterpiece in the true sense of the word, and a great album to have.']",5.00 stars
EvBones,"['First of all, anyone who doesn\'t give this masterpiece (calling it an album would be too ordinary and too degrading for a work of such caliber) five stars is a dumbass. And true, while listening to this CD stoned does blow your mind, it\'s awesome no matter what condition you\'re in. Easily the greatest concept idea ever, the way everything blends into the next song making the entire CD basically one big song is sheer perfection. The backing vocals were a great trick that only the madness of Roger Waters could come up with. This is one of the few CDs you can play completely through countless times and never get sick of it, because each time you find something new to love. Best songs: ""Breathe,"" ""Time,"" ""Great Gig In The Sky"" (most beautiful Floyd piece ever), ""Money,""...ok actually I\'m just gonna stop because now that I think of it I\'d be naming 8 of the 9 songs, with the exception of ""On The Run"" which is in no way out of place on the CD, and that would be a large percentage of the disc. One of the best CDs ever.']",5.00 stars

mcsegeek1,"[""Every several years or so, an album comes along that sets a new standard for the genre. Dark Side of the Moon is easily one of the best albums ever recorded, regardless of style. A true sonic masterpiece from beginning to end, it broke new ground in digital effects, merging them seamlessly with the more conventional rock sound. Easily Pink Floyd's best album, it even surpasses The Wall, and has stood the test of time. It's difficult to classify this recording into any one style. To call it psychedelic rock is far too simplistic. Whatever category you may think it belongs to, Dark Side of the Moon is absolutely indispensable to any collection.""]",5.00 stars
McKenna,"[""Pink Floyd's 1973 release of _Dark Side of the Moon_ signaled a new era and a coming of age for the group. Roger Waters' instrumental placement of lyrics co-mingled with Richard Wright and David Gilmour’s empowered musicianship truly showed us all a new wave of deep rock music. Roger Waters' feelings of anguish over everyday life became a point that is heard quite loudly in the album. The band honed their ideas together as a whole and produced a true work of art. The innocence and simplicity of these songs became the anthem of a generation looking for answers. Compared to other albums such as _Meddle_, Roger Waters spoke candidly about making this album visible and clear, no frills and no hidden meanings. This album is truly a masterpiece.""]",4.50 stars
